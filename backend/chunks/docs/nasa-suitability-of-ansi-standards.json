INTRODUCTION \nIthasbeen argued that communication satellites arelosing their monopoly \ninthe long-haul transmission market (Byrne, 1985). With the day-by-day \nincrease inoptical fiber cable miles and long-haul communication providers \nsuch asSprint touting the advantages ofoptical fiber communicatio_s, the \ncommunication satellite industry future does indeed seem dim. }{owever, one \nmust remember that the imminent demise ofterrestrial m_crowave systems _a_ \nincorrectly predicted with theadvent ofcommunication satellites. \nToday, both communication satellites and terrestrial microwave systems \ncoexist inahighly competitive market. Although, theimmediate competitive \nthreat imposed byfiber istotheterrestrial microwave systems, this does not \nimply tha\" thecommunication satellite industry andservice-providers need do \nnothing toenhance their product° Toremain aviable andprofitable industry, \ncommunication satellites will need toevolve beyond therole ofsimple, loug- \nhaul transmission links. They will need tobecome anintegral part ofdata \ncommunication networks such asanIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). \n*The author iswith the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, National \nTelecommunications andInformation Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce, \nBoulder, CO80303-3328. \n ! _a\n\n• r_:._._r_!_,_ ,_,_.__..,..___. _........... _............,,_.,,_,_._._._ ,._,.._._,.._..,_ _..::,_:._........._..___•_._ _,_o._,_,_ _,_ _,__.;__..__._,•__,_.,_.._,_ __._. ..... _ \ni\" Commensurate with this evolution, theways bywhich communication satell_te \nsv':tem performance ismeasured andspecified needs tobereevaluated. \n1.1 Evolution oftheCommunication Satellite andItsRole \nLovell andCuccia (1984) ofNASA have classified communication satellites \ninto thre_ categories: \ni.Type Asatellites carrying one ormore simple transponders and \nearth-coverage antenna. \n2.Type Bsatellites carrying multiple fixed antennas and multiple \ntransponders, where under ground control the in_erconnectivity \n; between thebeams andtransponders canberearranged. \n! 3.Type Csatellites similar totype Bbutwith onboard message- i; J \n switching capabilities. \n_i The transponders forboth type Aandtype Bsatellites areanalog a'._dsupport \ni single ormultiple communication channels. Type Csatellites dynamically \ncontrol the beam coverage areas and route the message traffic tothe \ni appropriate beams. Insome designs, (NASA's Advanced Communications Technology \nSatellite [ACTS] forexample) thetransponders aredigital andregenerate the \nsignal.\nThe first commercially viable communication satellites were simple analog \nmicrm:ave repeaters ingeostationary orbit. Their main function wastoprovide \npoint-to-point, high volume trunking for telephone and television systems. \n• Even with today's increased transponder capacity anddown-link power, higher \noperating frequencies, time-divisio,_ multiple-access (TDMA), digital \nmodulation, and frequency reuse, communication satellites are still notmuch \nmo,. than repeaters, \nUnfortunately, these high volume, point-to-p_int satellite tru:,Li.g \nservices are chose most threatened byoptical fiber systems,Traditionally \nfor geographic separations greater then 800 km, point-to-point satellite \n trunking has been the most economical trm_smission method (Byrne, 1985). \ni However, with the introduction ofoptical fiber transmission li_ks this \ndistance advantage isdecreasing. The,s0 future communication satellite systems \ni will have tolook elsewhere fortheir marketshare. \ni Fortunately, the demand forpoit_t-to-multipoint service isincreasing. ,, Th_s demand has been fueled byhigher frequency andhigher power satellites \ni1989010985-012\n\nsuch asthose planned forDirect Broadcast Service (DBS) andadvances inearth \nstation technology reducing the costs ofsmall receive-only earth stations. \nFor $i000 to$2000, almost any broadcast service can bereceived inthe \nremotest parts ofthe country. Multipoint-to-point, e.g.,oil pipeline \nmonitoring systems (Gonze, 1987), isanother service that communication \nsatellites arebeginning toprovide. Both ofthese areservices that optical \nfiber transmission systems would behard pressed toprovide economically. \nAdditionally, satellite systems formobile :ommunication applications arebeing \ndeveloped, aservice that fiber cannot provide. All ofthese services, \nhowever, arestill using thesatellite basically asasimple repeater. \n! TheNASA ACTS program takes thesatellite be,_ond this simple repeater role \nbyproviding anexperimental advanced communication satellite that will \ndemonstrate improved repeater technology andonboard baseband switching for \ntraffic routing andnetwork control. Thesatellite will operate intheKaband \n(17to31GHz) with small diameter spot beams andcross polarization _oreduce \ninterchannel interference andtoiucrease frequency reuse. Theonboard switch \nwill operate ineither amicrowave mode, switching atthe intermediate \nfrequency (IF) like type Csatellites (INTELSAT VI), orinabaseband mode, \noperating asademand-assignment multiple-access (DAMA) _y_cem with digital \nsignal regeneration and forward error control coding. Thus, therole ofthe \ncommunication satellite isevolving from one ofasimple point-to-point \ntransmission link tothat ofanetwork switching center, further enhancing the \ncommunication satellite's ability to provide point-to-multipoint and \nmultipoint-to-point network connectivity. \nSatellites, such asACTS, and inexpensive very-small-aperture terminals \n(VSAT) will enable communication satellites toprovide economical, thin-route, \ntwo-way communication services tosparsely populated andinaccessible areas. \nThese satellite systems will also facilitate two-way mobile communication. \nAdditionally, thesp satellites will fitvery naturally into data networks such \nasanISDN, where thesatellite itself becomes oneoftheISDN switching nodes. \nSatellites with onboard ISDN switching capability could beUsed toprovide \nprivate ISDN services for large corporations. They could interconnect \ngeographically dispersed locations with high-volume 23B+D Primary Rate ISDN \n(1.544 Mb/n) ormultiple-megabit per second broadband ISDN circuits. These \nsatellites could also support two-way, thin-route traffic with direct links of 1989010985-013\n\nsatellites could also support two-way, thin-route traffic with direct links of \ntheBasic ISON interface (2B+D channels at144kb/s) tothecustomer premises \nequipment (CPE). Other satellite-based or satellite-augmented ISDN \napplications include small transportable terminals fortemporary network access \nand mobile ISDN connectivity. These ISDN-compatible satellites working in \n parallel with fiber trunks andterrestrial switches could also provide network \nbackup andquick emergency service restoration. \n1.2 Theincreasing Need forSystem Performance Measurements \nWith communication satellite systems evolving into newroles, evolution is \nalso required inperformance specification andmeasurement methods forthese \nsystems, Twostrong reasons arepushing this need: \ni I.Communication satellite systems arebeing used foralarger portion \nofdata communication networks. \n2.Users arebecoming less concerned with thetechnical design issues \nofdata communication systems and more concerned with finding \nsystems that meet their needs. \nWhen satellites provide simple analog repeater service, the users are \nprimarily concerned with thesystem capacity, measured asthenumber ofanalog \nvoice circuits orvideo channels thesystem cansupport. This isafunction of \n themodulation techniques andthecarrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) ofthe \ni total satellite link (wh_re C/No isestablished bythe basic link budget \ncalculations). Very often theusers arenotexperienced orinterested inthe \ndetails ofsatellite link budget calculations; however, they are very \ninterested inhow well the system meets their capacity and availability \nrequirements. Thus, users generally buy service frol0satellite service \nproviders who design the users'links. Once established, the links are \ndedicated full time totheusers. \nThe situation for digital satellite transmission links isnot much \ni different from that foranalog. Capacity isstill theyardstick formeasuring \nI performance and itstill depends onlink budget calculations. (Th_ signaling \nrate-dependent, bitenergy-to-noise density ratio [Eb/No] isused inplace of \nC/No astheprimary link budget parameter.) However, capacity isnowmeasured \nastheuser-information bitrate with aspecified biterror probability (Pc). \nTheEb/No link parameter fixes Peforgiven source anderror-control coding and \ni 4 1989010985-014\n\nprobabilities andinformation transfer rate inaddition tosystem availability. \nAgain theusers typically gotosatellite service providers toobtain thelinks \nthey need.Also,asintheanalog case, once thelinks areestablished, they \narededicated full time totheusers. \nWith communication satellites incorporating more ofthenetwork switching \nfunctions and thus more users accessing thenetwork onademand assignment \nmultiple access (DAMA) basis,link budget calculations nolonger fully specify \nsystem performance. Users are becoming concerned with parameters such as \naccess anddisengagement time andblocking probability. Thetransmission link \nisalso more dynamic inthese type Csatellites, with forward error-control \ncoding andreduced transmission rates \"switched in\"during rain fades. \nQuantifying theperformance ofthese advanced type Csatellites canbecome \nanarduous task. However, ifoneviews these satellite systems asthedigital \ncommunication networks they arebecoming, thetask isquite manageable. This \nisbecause oftwo standards approved bythe American National Standards \nInstitute (ANSI), American National Standards (ANS) X3.]02 andANSX3.141, for \nspecifying and measuring data communication system performance with user- \noriented performance parameters. These standards define parameters and \nmeasurement methods forquantifying data communication system performance from \ntheuser's point ofview, independent ofsystem design and implementation. \nANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 provide thedata communication system user a\"common \nyardstick\" forcomparing howwe_l dissimilar systems--satellite, optical fiber, \nmicrowave, orany other transmission media and switching systems--meet their \nneeds. ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 canbeused tohelp identify what each system \ndoes best. And theuser does notneed toknow how thesystem isdesigned or \nimplemented.\nFrom theservice provider°s point ofview, ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 offer \naconvenient means forcomparing their service against acompetitor's. These \nstandards can also beused totrack system degradations n'_d help identify \npotential bottlenecks. They areused toaugment thelink budget andcapacity \ncalculations forfully describing thesystem performance. \n1.3 Purpose andScope ofReport \nThis report focuses on communication satellite system performance \nmeasurements and specifications. The purpose istoshow thesultabi]ity of 1989010985-015\n\n!\n! ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 forquantifying theend-to-end system performance of \ncurrent andfuture advanced communication satellite systems such asACTS. \nThis report isdivided into several major sections. Section 2presents an \noverview ofANS X3.102 and ANS X3.141 and how they are used toquantify \ncommunication system performance. Section 3presents adiscussion onhow \nANSX3.102 and ANS X3.141 can beused toquantify the performance ofthe \nvarious type A,B,andCand TDMA satellite systems. Section 4presents a \nbrief overview ofNASA's ACTS andhowitoperates from theuser's perspective. \nItthen concentrates onhow toapply ANS X3.102 and ANS X3.141 system \nperformance measurement concepts totheACTS system. Itconcludes with ashort \ndiscussion onthe design ofanACTS system performance experiment using the \nframework ofANS X3.141. The appendix gives anoverview oflink budget \ncalculations.\n2.OVERVIEW OFAMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS X3.102 A/_DX3.141 \nInthepast, thedata ccmmunication community hashaddifficulty ingetting \nthebest (and least expensive) data communicatiou systems that fititsneeds. \nTohelp solve this problem, ANSI approved thetwodata communication systems \nperformamce standards: \nI.The American National Standard for Information Systems--Data \nCommunication Systems and Services--User-oriented Performance i \nParameters, ANSX3.102 (ANSI 1983). i \n2.The American National Standard for Information System_--Data \nCommunication Systems andServices--Measurement Methods forUser- \noriented Performance Evaluation, ANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987). \nThese two standards form the basis ofth_ \"functional approach\" todata \ncommunication system procurement described inSeitz andGrubb (1983). \nThebenefits ofusing this functional approach andofthese ANSI standards \nare many. Tothe data communication system users, their requirements are \nprecisely defined; they donotneed tobecome system designers and they can \nspecify the system that best fits their needs and budgets without being \nconstrained toaparticular design. Tothedata communication system designers \nand service providers, their ability toassess existing and proposed new \nservices from theuser's perspective isimproved, allowing them toidentify \nareas for improvement and/or cost reduction without sacrificing system \n61989010985'016\n\nperformance. Andtothedata communication experimenters andresearchers, they \nnowhave themethods and tools forconducting and analyzing repeatable data \ncommunication system performance measurements onexperimental systems such as \nACTS.\n2.1 ANSX3I02Approach \nEnd-to-end system performance isdescribed bythe performance ofthree \nsystem functions: access, user information transfer, anddisengagement. These \nsystem functions are quantified bythree performance outcomes: successful \nperformance (speed), incorrect performance (accuracy), and nonperformance \n(reliability). Seitz andGrubb (1983) define these performance outcomes as \nfollows:\ni.Successful Performance. The function iscompleted within a \nspecified maximum performance time, and theresult oroutput is \nexactly what was inte_4ed. Afamiliar example issuccessful \nconnection tothecorrect called party inavoice telephone call. \n2.Incorrect Performance. The function iscompleted within the \nspecified maximum performance time, but the result oroutput is \nsomehow different from what was intended. Afamiliar example is \nthe connection toa\"wrong number\" (as aresult ofasystem \nswitching error) inavoice telephone call. \n3.Nonperformance. Thefunction isnotcompleted within aspecified \nmaximum performance time. Afamiliar example istheblocking ofa \nvoice telephone call attempt bythesystem (asindicated bya\"all \ntrunks busy\" signal). \nAsummary ofthe performance outcomes that apply tothevarious system \nfunctions isshown inTable i.Incor[ect performance issubdivided into three \noutcomes: content error, where the information isinerror; location error, \nwhere the information was sent tothewrong location; andextra event, where \nunrequested information was received. Nonperformance issubdivided into two \noutcomes: system nonperformance, where the system isresponsible for the \noutage; anduser nonperformance, where theuser isresponsible fortheoutage. \nNonperformance outcomes duetouser nonperformance areexcluded from thesample \nspace andsystem performance calculation asthese donotmeasure anyfunctions \nperformed bythesystem.Thebit transfer andblock transfer functions shown \ninTable iaresubsets oftheuser information transfer function. \nThemajor effort inapplying ANSX3.102 toend-to-end data communic_it;o_ \nsystem performance measurements isselecting the appropriate performaTwe \n71989010985-017\n\n1989010985-018\n\nparameters. Sections 3and4ofthis report address this forseveral classes \nofcommunication satellites. Table 2lists, inmatrix _orm, the21ANSX3.102 \nperformance parameters defined inANSI (1983). Listed are 17primary \nperformance parameters that quantify theperformance criteria (speed, accuracy, \nand reliability) for the three communication system functions (access,user \ninformation transfer, anddisengagement). Thetable also shows four ancillary \nparameters that relate the user's impact onthe speed ofthe three system \nfunctions.\nTheANSX3.102 performance parameters aredefined insuch awaythat they \ncanbeapplied toanydata communication system orservice foralltopologies, \nprotocols, codes, orother design characteristics (ANSI, 1987). They apply to \nboth connection-oriented systems like thepublic-switched telephone network, \nand connectionless packet-switched networks like ARPANET. Also,unlike most \nstandards, ANS X3.102 gives only the parameter definitions, not specific \nparameter values.Thevalues oftheparameters aredetermined bythecontext \nofthe user's specific requirements. Additionally, only asubset ofthe \nperformance parameters need bespecified ifitfully describes the user's \nperformance requirements. \n2.1.1 Access \nFour primary performance parameters andoneancillary performance parameter \nare defined for the access function.These parameters are Access Time, \nIncorrect Access Probability, Access Denial Probability, Access Outage \nProbability, andUser Fraction ofAccess Time (see Table 2). ANSI (1983) and \nSeitz and Grubb (1983) give justifications for the selection ofthese \nparameters andtheir mathematical definitions. Theaccess function isdefined \nasfollows:\nTheaccess function begins upo'_ issuance ofan\"access request\" signal \noritsimplied equivalent attheinterface between auser andthedata \ncommunication system. Itends when the first bit ofsource user \ninformation isinput tothesystem (after connection establishment in \nconnection-oriented services). It includes all activities \ntraditionally associated with physical circuit establishment (e.g., \ndialing, switching, andringing) aswell asanyactivities performed at \nhigher protocol levels (e.g., X.25 virtual circuit establishment). 1989010985-019\n\nIO1989010985-020\n\nThe speed performance criterion isdescribed byAccess Time, theelapsed i \ntime between theoriginating user issuing anaccess request (e.g., pick upthe 4 \nphone) andthefirst bitofuser information entering thesystem. \nThe accuracy performance criterion isdescribed bytheIncorrect Access \nProbability, the probability ofthe system making awrong connection. This \nparameter generally applies toconnection-oriented systems only, where the \nmisconnection istypically due toswitching oraddress errors. The user \ndialing awrong number isnotincluded inthis parameter because that isnota \nsystem-caused error. \nThe reliability performance criterion isdescribed bythe performance \nparameters Access _Denial Probability andAccess Outage Probability. Access \nDenial Probability isthe probability that thesystem will block theuser's \ncall, e.g., \"all circuits arebusy.\" Access denial also occurs when thetime \ntoaccess thesystem exceeds theAccess Time threshold depicted inFigure i. \nAsdefined inANSI (1983), theAccess Time threshold isthree times themean \nAccess Time. Ifanaccess attempt exceeds this threshold itiscounted asan \nAccess Denial. The Access Outage Probability isthe probability that the | \nsystem does notrespond totherequest forservice, e.g., theuser does notget \na\"dial tone\" when he/she picks upthephone toplace acall. This outage is \nduetopart orallofthesystem being \"down.\" \nThe ancillary performance parameter associated with access isthe User \nFraction ofAccess Time. This isthelength oftime theusers areresponsible \nforprocessing theaccess request, e.g., thelength oftime ittakes to\"dial\" \nthenumber andanswer thephone. \n2.1.2 User Information Transfer \nEleven primary performance parameters and one ancillary performance \nparameter are defined for the user information transfer function. These \nparameters areBlock Transfer Time, User Information Bit Transfer Rate, Bit \nError Probability, Block Error Probability, BitMisdelivery probability, Block \nMisdelivery Probability, Extra Bit Probability, Extra Block Probability, Bit \nLoss Probability, Block Loss Probability, Transfer Denial Probability, User \nFraction ofBlock Transfer Time, andUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time (see \nTable 2). ANSI (1983) andSeitz andGrubb (1983) give justifications forthe \nII\n\neouaJjnooo joAouenbeJ-IeA!Ir_leEl \nI'21989010985-022\n\n.................................. _...____ .i........ i............. _._!:....................... __._/_--_\" _ m,_ r_-_ \nselection oftheseparameters and their mathematical definitions. Theuser _i \ninformation transfer function isdefined asfollows: i \nTheuser information transfer function begins when theaccess function \nends. The user information transfer function ends when the last \n\"disengagement request\" inaparticular data communication session is \nissued. Itincludes all formatting, transmission, storage, error \ncontrol, and media conversion activities performed between start of \ntransfer and completion of delivery, including any needed \nretransmissions within thesystem. \nThespeed performance criterion isdescribed bytheBlock Transfer Time and \nUser Information BitTransfer Rate. The Block Transfer Time istheaverage \nelapsed time between the start ofablock transfer attempt andaSuccessful \nBlock Transfer, i.e., thelength oftime auser information block isintransit \nbetween thesource anddestination users. Aswith alltheblock parameters, a \nblock ofuser information maybeanycontiguous stream ofbits that hasmeaning \ntothe users, e.g., asingle ASCII character (7bits) ora128-byte X.25 \npacket. The User Information Bit Transfer Rate isthe total number of \nSuccessful BitTransfer outcomes inanindividual transfer sample divided by \ntheinput/output time forthat sample (ANSI, 1983). Asshown inFigure 2,the \ninput and output times may bedifferent insome systems (usually packet- \nswitched systems). Thelongest time istaken asthedivisor, thus giving the \nslower ofthetwopossible rates. \nThe accuracy performance criterion isdescribed bysix ofthebit/block i \nI performance parameters. The Bit and Block Error Probabilities expres_ the \nlikelihood that aunit ofuser information transferred from asource user to \ntheintended destination user isdelivered with incorrect binary content. The \nBitandBlock Misdelivery Probabilities specify theportion ofbits andblocks \nthat wastransferred from aso_'-ce user toanunintended destination user.The \nExtra Bit and Extra Block Probabilities express the likelihood that the \ninformation delivered toadestination user will contain duplicate bits or \nblocks ¢,rother extra information notoutput bythesource user. \nThereliability performance criterion isexpressed bytwoofthebit/block \nperformance parameters. TheBitLoss andBlock Loss Probabilities express the \nlikelihood that thesystem will fail todelivera unit ofuser information to \ntheintended destination user within thespecified maximum transfer time.The \n7'31989010985-023\n\nCase1.Norateconversion :w(b3i)=w(b3o) \nw,b3, Iw,b3°, \"-_'-'w(b3o)\nCase2.Rateincrease: Case3.Ralereduction ' \nw(b3i)>w(b3o) w(b3i)<w(b3o) \nBIs\nUserInformation BitTransfer RateR(bls)= \nMax[w(b3i)orw(b3O)] \nB1s=TotalSuccessful BitTransfer outcomes inthetransfer sample, \nFi._ure 2.Userinformation bittransl'er _'ate (Seitz andGrubb,1983). 1989010985-024\n\nthreshold forthis maximum transfer time isdefined asthree times itsnominal \nvalue, similar tothethreshold foraccess denial shown inFigure i. \nTheTransfer Denial Probability expresses thelikelihood ofanunacceptable \ndegradation intheperformsnce ofadata communication service during user \ninformation transfer. Transfer denial isdefined tooccur whenever the \nperformance observed during atransfer sample isworse than thethreshold of \nacceptability for any ofthe four supported user information transfer \nparameters: Bit Error Probability, Bit Loss Probability, Extra Bit \nProbability, and user information transfer Rate. ANSI (1983) defines the \nthreshold for theprobability parameters asthefourth root otthespecified \nprobability value, e.g., aspecified Bit Error Probability of10-6has a \ntransfer denial threshold error probability of3.16 X10.2Thethreshold for \nUser Information Transfer Rate isdefined asthree times itsnominal value, \nsimilar tothethreshold forAccess Denial shown inFigure i. \nThe ancillary performance parameters associated with user information \ntransfer aretheUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time andtheUser Fraction of \nInput/Output Time. TheUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time isthelength of \ntime theuser hascontrol oftheblock transfer, e.g., stopping theinformation \ntransfer toread ascreen full oftext. TheUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time \nisthetime theuser has control oftheinput oroutput ofthesystem, e.g., \ntyping slower than the system can accept characters. Aswith theancillary \nparameter foraccess, these give ameasure fortheimpact oftheuser onthe \nend-to-end system performance. \n2.1.3 Disengagement \nTwoprimary performance parameters andoneancillary performance parameter \naredefined forthedisengagement function. These parameters areDisengagement \nTime, Disengagement Denial Probability, andUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time \n(see Table 2). ANSI (1983) andSeitz andGrubb (1983) give justifications for \nthe selection ofthese parameters and their mathematical definitions. The \ndisengagement function isasfollows: \nThere isadisengagement function associated with each participant ina \ndata communication sessi_m. Each disengagement function begins on \nissuance ofa\"disengagement request.\" The disengagement function \nends, foreach user, when (i)disengagement hasbeen _\"qL'sted forth_it \nuser; and (2) that user isable toinitiate anew access attempt. \n151989010985-025\n\n........... •.............._____:::__:_.....'_:_ __•__:_i \"7\"_\"_..-_7_%_f_-71TI_T_7 '_'_i__'_ ....._ _7._.___\"__ \n!\nDisengagement includes both physical circuit disconnection (where \nrequired) and higher-level protocol termination activities such as \n! X.25 virtual circuit clearing. \n! The speed performallce criterion isdescribed byDisengagement Time \n parameter, the average time auser must wait after requesting disengagement \nfrom adata communication session forthesystem tosuccessfully accomplish the \ndisengagement function (Seitz andGrubb, 1983). Theaccuracy and reliabi]ity \nperformance criterion isdescribed bythe Disengagement Denial Probability \nparameter, thelikelihood that thesystem will fail todisconnect auser from \nthecommunication session within aspecified maximum time after adisengagement \nrequest hasbeen issued. \nThe ancillary performance p_rameter associated with disengagement isthe \nUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time. This isthetime requiied fortheuser to \ninitiate tL_.disconnect request, e.g., the time required for theuser not \noriginating the disconnect request torespond tothe system-generated \ndisconnect request ina\"four wayhandshake\" system. \nAccess Outage Probability along with theTransfer Denial Probability are \nused toquantify thecommonly use_, system parameter--system availability. \n2.2 ANSX3.141 Measurement Process \nTheend-to-end performance ofadata communication system canbemeasured \nand quantified interms oftheANS X3.102 performance parameters with the \nANSX3.141 Measurement Process shown inFigure 3. The inputs totheprocess \nare the measurcment objectives and the digltal signals observed atthe \nuser/system interfaces. The outputs from theprocess aretheestimated mean \nvalues and associated precision andvariability statistics (e.g., confidence \nlimits, histograms, andregression coefficients) oftheperformance parameters \nselected tocharacterize thesystem (ANSI, 1987). \nThree measurement objectives aredefined inANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987): \nI.Absolute Performance Characterization. Establishing the \nperformance baseline ofthesystem. \n2.Simple Hypothesis Test. Measuring toseeifthesystem performance \niswithin some previously stated bounds. \n3.Ana1_J_[s ofFactor Effects. Measuring toseehowdifferent system \nconfigurations affect system performance. \n161989010985-026\n\n]71989010985-027\n\nSystemdesigners, service_oviders, andexperimenters are interested inthe \nfirst and third objectives for determining the basic systemperformance \ncharacteristics. Users areinterested inthesecond objective fordetermining \nifthesystemmeets their performance requirements. \nAsshown inFigure 3,themeasurement process iscarried outinfour steps: \nI.Experiment Design. Adetailed experiment plan isdeveloped from \nthe desired measurement objectives. Thespecific performance \ninformation tobecollected isidentified and individual test \nconditions set. \n2.Data Extraction. Selected pairs ofdigital user/systeminterfaces \naremonitored inreal time.Achronological event history ofthe \nnature and time relevant interface events occur isrecorded. \n(Table 3lists tile generic ANS X3.141 reference events that \ncorrelate tothese system-specific reference events.) \n3.Data Reduction. Estimated values ofthe selected performance \nparameters aregenerated from theevent histories recorded during \nthedata extraction step. \n4.Data Analysis. The precision andvariability ofthe individual \nparameter estimates isdetermined. \n(ANSI [1987] presents anindepth description ofthese steps and gives a \ndetailed example oftheANSX3.141 measurement process.) \nThefirst step inusing ANSX3.141 formeasuring data communication system \nperformance istodescribe auser-oriented view ofthedata communication \nsystem.This isdone bydefining whoorwhat theusers areand thespecific \nuser/system interfaces. ANSI (1983) defines four data communication system \nuser/system interfaces asshown inFigure 4. The,,scrs canrange from human \noperators toapplication programs running inhost computers. Itisalso \npossible for the users tobeother data communication systems; here the \nuser/system interfaces arethesubsystem interfaces shown inFigure 5. \nDuring acommunication session, information istransferred across the \nmonitored user/system orsubsystem _nterfaces. This information transfer \nconstitutes an_nteraction with the system, referred tobyANS X3.102 as \n\"interface events.\" Certain keyinterface events areidentified asevents to \nbecounted, timed, orcompared forcalculating theperformance parameter values \n(Seitz andGrubb, 1983). \nWith the user/system interface andkey interface events identified, the \nmeasurement process iscarried out.

The occurrence ofthese interface events identify system function \ntransitions orsystem failures, (e.g., receipt ofreference event 3,system \nolocking signal). \nii Aswith anyexperiment, decisions onthepopulation tosample andthe \nappropriate sample size must bemade. Miles (1984) presents adetailed \ndiscussion onsample size selection and precision for data communication \nperformance measurements. Additionally, Miles (1984) offers aFORTRAN computer \nprogram tobeused incol_unction with the system performance measurements \nexperiment that calculates the required sample size and independence of \npopulation samples. \nInsummary, ANSX3.102 provides ameans ofcomparing \"apples\" and\"oranges\" \nbydefining a\"common yardstick\" formaking andspecifying system performance \nmeasurements, while ANSX3.141 describes auniform way tousetheyardstick. \nAsdiscussed inSection 4,this yardstick isvery useful fordescribing ways to \nmeasure andquantify ti'eACTS LowBur_;_ Rate (LBR) system performance. \n3.COMMUNICATION SATELLITE END-TO-END SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DEFINITIONS \nThis section applies the ANS X3.i02 and ANS X3.141 data communication \nsystem performance specification andmeasurement ideas detailed inSection 2to \nseveral classes ofcommunication satellites. The first subsection starts by \nbriefly discussing the conventional ]ink budget calculation method of \nspecifying type AandBcommunication satellite system performance, followed by \nadiscussion ofthe use ofANS X3.102 for quantifying the end-to-end \nperformance ofdigital links over these same satellites. Thesecond subsection \ndiscusses theuseofANSX3.102 forquantifying theend-to-e..d communication \nsystem performance oftime-division multiple-access (TDMA), satellite-switched \ntime-division multiple-access (SS/TDMA), (type C), and demand-assignment \nmultiple-access (DAMA) communication satellites. Thethird subsection briefly \ndiscusses future satellite-augmented ISDN systems andhow ANS X3.102 canbe \nu_ed toquantify their end-to-end communication system performance. \n3.1 Analog andDigital Link Parameters \nThe classes ofcommunication satellites considered inthis subsection are \nprimarily type Aaud type Bsystems asdefined inSection I. These systems \n221989010985-032\n\nprovide simple dedicated point-to-point analog service, dedicated point-to- \npoint digital service, and analog and digital broadcastservice. Inallof \nthese systems, the satellite serves asanonregenerative analog repeater. \nSince none ofthese systems include any switching ordynamic link control \nfunctions, communication system performance issimply equal totransmission \nlink performance. \n3.1.i TheLink Budget \nThetwo-step process oflink budget andsystem capacity calculation isthe \nusual method for quantifying communication satellite link performance. The \nlink budget calculation gives the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) for \nanalog systems, andthebitenergy-to noise density ratio (Eb/No) fordigital \ntransmission systems. The system capacity calculation gives the number of \nvoice circuits orvideo channel= ananalog system cansupport andtheuser bit \nrate adigital system cansu[,port. Theappendix gives adetailed discussion \nandexample ofthese link budget andcapacity calculations. Thebottom line \nfrom these calculations isthecommunication satellite link performance stated \n!' asbaseband signal-to-noise ratio (Sb/Nb) and channel capacity for analog \nii systems, andbiterror probability (Pe) andtransmission bit rate fordigital \n_: systems. \ni 3.1.'User-Oriented Performance Measurements \ni The system link budget and capacity calculations while straightforward, \n! well understood, anduseful tosystem designers andservice providers, arevery \n: involved and oflittle interest tomost telecommunication managers ordata \n_ communication systems users ofsystems that comprise satellite links. However, \nI\n end-to-er isystem performance measurements using ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 can \n bevery u_eful enabling themanagers andusers tospecify system performance \n interms meaningful tothem. \n_ ANS X3.102 andANS X3.141 are primarily intended tobeused inmeasuring \n_'_ thesystem performance between user interfaces. However, they mayal_. b_used \ni tomeasure the performance ofagroup ofdata communication system (or \n_ subsystem) elements terminated at,'igital interfaces. Such agroup ofsystem I\n:_ elements could easily beadedicated ormultiple access (nondemand assignment), \n point-to-point, type AorBdigital communication satellite link. Thedigital \ni 23 ,.1989010985-033\n\ninterfaces could bethebaseband data input ofamultiplexer ortheaggregate \ndata input ofasatellite earth station modem. \nUser-oriented system performance concerns for types Aand Bdigital \nsatellite links canbegrouped into thethree ANSX3.102 performance categories \nofspeed, accuracy, andreliability discussed inSection 2.These categories \narequantified by5ofthe21ANSX3.102 system performance parameters: Bit \nError Probability, Block Error Probability, Block Transfer Time, User \nInformation Bit Transfer Rate, and Transfer Denial Probability (Table 4). \nThese five parameters areselected entirely from theuser information transfer \nfunction category ofANSX3.102. This selection isreasonable because with \ndedicated point-to-point digital satellite links users have full time access; \nthus, Access and disengagement functions are r;ot encountered during normal \noperation. Also since there arenoswitching orstore-and-forward functions, \ndata entering the system follows only one path; thus, there are no \nopportunities for user bits oruser data blocks tobeduplicated, lost, or \nmisrouted. Therefore, th_bit/block loss andmisdelivery probability andextra \nbit/block probability parameters arenotincluded. \nThefour ancillary parameters (attributable touser actions) arealso not \nincluded. Bytreating thesatellite links assubsystems, there arenodirect \nconnections orinteractions with theusers. Itisassumed that data arealways \navailable fortransmission atrates thelinks support. \nThe five applicable performance parameters describe type Aand type B \ncommunication satellite system performance asfollows: \nBit/Block Error Probability \nTreating thesatellite link asasubsystem, theBitError Probability and \nBlock Error Probability arethe\"raw channel\" error probabilities. These are \nerrors observed atthe transmission channel interface with noforward error \ncontrol (FEC) codes orhigh-level protocols employing error detection and \nretransmission (ARQ). These error probabilities are the same asthe Pe \nparameter inthelink budget andsystem capacity calculations. Atypical design \ngoal forsatellite links isabiterror probability ofless then 10.6 Ablock \nerror isdeclared when oneormore bits composing theblock areinerror. \n241989010985'034\n\nX XXXX XX X XX XXXXX\nQ\n 0 1.4\n p_ XXXXX XXXX 4J I-\nLl\nt_\n(J _ XX><XX XXXX n \nE}.4 o \no _.. \n _ Ixxx xx '_ \nm b. _ \nI IJ I) \nI Q\" - \n--_\n=,-_._\"3nT,\":pXo°O- _.+,\"6333 \"_._ \n•\"o go...o.a-n.->nno'_cc I)_c\"(-rrI_ \n _'_ c-_o'__ oooo _ o.,o-,----_E_ EEi \n._ _{7oooo \n==F_oo o_-_-- ..,.a \n-_<< W \n __ mmm m z......... d,_NFi#_ _dKm&d,-: \nm\no. o,_ ob; \nE o,oE '.; m _ c- \nU • •L0C _=o C u O \n3 u _I_° E0\n251989010985-035\n\nBlockTransfer Time \nBlock Transfer Time isthesignal propagation delay tothesatellite and \nback (approximately 250 ms) and the modulation time for the block. The \npropagation time isthe same forall types Aand Bcommunication satellite \nsystems.Themodulation time isthetime required to\"clock\" thedata block \ninto thesystem; itdepends onthechannel transmission rate andblock length. \nUser Information BitTransfer Rate \nTheUser Information BitTransfer Rate, often referred toasthroughput, is \ntheuser bit rate thesystem supports. This parameter isthesame asthebit \nrate (Rb) discussed intheappendix.Since there are nostore and forward \ncapabilities with type AandBcommunication satellites, there arenothrough- \nputrate conversions; thus, thesystem input rate equals thesystem output rate \nasshown bycase IofFigure 2. \nTransfer Denial Probability \nTransfer denial occurs when the transmission quality ofthe link has \ndegraded toapoint that the Bit Error Probability orUser Information Bit \nTransfer Rate isworse than aspecified threshold (see Section 2). However, \nfordedicated point-to-point systems, theUser Information BitRate isconstant \nand thus would not contribute totransfer denial.Increased Pedue tosun \noutages andrain fades are theprimary cause.Sunoutages occur twice ayear \nwhen the satellite eclipses the sun during the spring and autumn equinox, \ncausing theearth station system noise temperature torise, thus increasing the \nPe. Sunoutages last about twotosixl_inutes adayforatwo- tofour-day \nperiod.Rain fades are due tothe increased propagation loss and thus \nincreased Pecaused bylocal rain storms.Thelimiting case oftransfer denial \nprobability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., thesystem is \n\"down\" because ofanequipment failure. TheTransfer Denial Probability canbe \nthought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. \nThere are distinct advantages inusing the ANS X3.102 performance \nparameters for quantifying type Aand Bcommunication satellite system \nperformance. First,byusing these parameters,theuser isable toevaluate \nhow well these satellite systems meet their requirements, how various \nconfigurations orfactors (e.g., QPSK modulation vsBPSK modulation) affect the \n261989010985-036\n\nperformance, andhow these satellite systems compare with other transmission \nsystems oradvanced switching communication satellites. Secondly, these \nparameters canbeused tospecify theuser's requirements, giving theservice \nprovider astarting point forthelink design. And finally, these parameters \nare relatively easy toobtain. Ifthelink budget has been calculated, the \nBit/Block Error Probability andUser Information BitTransfer Rate areknown. \nTheTransfer Denial Probability canbedetermined from rain fade models (see \nPritchard andSciulli, 1986) andtheBlock Transfer Time isknown apriori. If \nthelink budget parameters arenotavailable, link performance canbemeasured \nbyend-to-end system performance experiments similar tothose mentioned in \nSection 4.3.4 and described inANSI (1987).These experiments are greatly \nsimplified fortype Aandtype Bcommunication satellite systems because the \nstazt ofblock transfer andtheendofblock transfer aretheonly reference \nevents that need tobeobserved. \n3.2 TDMA,SS/TDMA,andDAMA System Performance Parameters \nTime-dlvlslon multlple-access, SS/TDMA (type C),and DAMA communication \nsatellite systems operate inatime-divlslon multiplex (TDM) fashion with \ntypically only one carrier presented toasatellite transponder atatime. \nEach earth station inthenetwork buffers itsincoming terrestrial data traffic \n(ordigital signals from digital speech interpolation [DSI] processors), then \ntransmits ittothe satellite atapreassigned time inahigh-rate burst \n(120 Mb/s forINTELSAT VI). \nThe primary advantage ofTDMA systems isreduced traveling wave tube \namplifier (TWTA) intermodulation distortion from having only onecarrier ata \ntime. This allows more efficient useofthetransponder andgreater down-link \npower, because the TWTA can beoperated closer tosaturation. Another \nadvantage isreduced earth station equipment costs forhigh-volume networks \n(Campanella etal.,1986). \nThere are many TDMA systems currently planned and inoperation. The \nsimplest, such asINTELSAT V(Trusty etal., 1986),use types Aand B \ncommunication satellites with global coverageand operate onapreassigned \nburst t:me plan (BTP) basis. SS/TDMA systems, such asINTELSAT VI(Trusty et \nal., 1986), use type Ccommunication satellites with switchable spot coverage \nantennas. These satellite-switched systems maximize the throughput ofthe \n271989010985-037\n\nr........... ............7 as-needed basis, thus reducing thenumber ofpermanently assigned transponders. \nDAMA systems, such asSatellite Business Systems (SBS) and TELECOM i \n(Feher, 1983), operate onashort-term orreal-time BTPassignment mode. These \ndemand-assignment systems further enhance the flexibility and throughput of \nTDMA systems bychanging the system configuration (BTP) i,_tea] time to \naccommodate changes inthenetwork traffic load. This isaccomplished byusing \ndifferent preassigned BTPs orgenerating new BTPs inreal time astraffic \ndemands change. \nFrom the user's perspective, all TDMA systems operate onaconnection- \noriented basis. Once the circuit has been established, the users have \nfull-time access toitand all their information traverses the same path \nthrough the system. Detailed information onthe various TDMA network \narchitectures, synchronization techniques andoperation concerns canbefound \ninFeher (1983). \nWith these advanced communication satellite systems, thelink budget and \ncapacity calculations are still useful tosystem designers and service \nproviders for designing the system. But, these calculations donot fully \nquantify the system's performance from the user's perspective. Therefore, \nusing ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 becomes very useful forquantifying theend-to- \nendsystem performance ofthese satellite systems. \nThe following subsection discusses how the 21ANS X3.102 performance \nparameters relate tothevarious TD_ communication satellite systems. Each \nperformance parameter isexamined and related tospecific system operation \nevents. Table 4lists the performance parameters deemed applicable tothe \nvarious TDMA systems discussed. The final selection ofthe performance \nparameters for quantifying aparticular system isuptotheuser andhis/her \nspecific system performance requirements. However, theend-to-end performance \nparameters discussed below provide astarting point forquantifying TDMA system \nperformance from the user's perspective and designing system performance \nexperiments around theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. \n3.2.1 Access \nAccess methods andtimes forthevarious TDMA systems differ. User access \ntothe preassigned TDMA, SS/TDMA, and DAMA systems that switch between \npreassigned BTPs toaccommodate traffic changes isaccomplished byprior \n281989010985-038\n\nscheduling with theTDMA control center. This canrange from acouple ofhours \ntomonths ahead ofwhen the circuit isneeded (Trusty etal., 1986). User \naccess toDAMA systems that generate new BTPs inreal time takes afew \nmilliseconds toafewminutes. Therefore, theapplication ofthefour access \nparameters islimited totheDAMA systelns generating BTPchanges inreal time. \nAccess Time \nAccess Time forDAMA systems isthetime from user issuance ofacircuit \nrequest tothestartoftheuser's data transmission. Thetime synchronizing \ntheuser's earth station tothenetwork isnot included intheAccess Time \nparameter asthis isnotrequired each time anew circuit isestablished. \nAccess Time isone ofthe most significantparameters for quantifying DAMA \nsystem performance. \nIncorrect Access Probability \nIncorrect _ccess Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability of \nestablishing a_zircuit with thewrong destination. Transmission errors during \nthecircuit request orgeneration and distribution ofthenew BTPs are the \nmechanisms for establishing anincorrect connection. However, inproperly \ndesigned DAMA networks, these errors arekept lowbytheuseoferror detection \nandcorrection techniques. Additionally, ifanerrored BTPisimplemented, the \nnetwork will lose synchronization and\"crash\" before theincorrect connection \nwasmade. Therefore, duetoitslowprobability ofoccurrence, theIncorrect \nAccess Probability parameter isnot included inthe set ofDAMA system \nperformance parameters. \nAccess Denial Probability \nAccess Denial Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability ofnot \nestabli&hing acircuit tothedesired destination. Theprimary cause ofaccess \ndenial islack ofsystem capacity toaccommodate anadditional circuit. It \nalso occur_ ifthesystem isslow inresponding totheaccess request orslow \ninsetting upthecircuit, thus exceeding theaccess denial threshold. Again \nthis would bedue tothesystem operating atornear capacity and thus not \nhaving sufficient processor capacity tohandl.e theadditional circuit request. \nWith knowledge ofthe tota] traffic carried bythe system, Access ,)enial \n291989010985-039\n\n;i\nProbability isagood measure ofsystem capacity al,dtherefore included inthe 1 \nsetofDAMA system performance parameters. \nAccess Outage Probability \nAccessOutageProbability istheprobability ofnotgetting aresponsefrom \nthosystem when makinga_laccessrequest, i.e., thesystem is\"dead.\" Any \nnumber ofhardwareandsoftware failures cancausethesystem tobeout. The \nAccess OutageProbability, along with theTransfer Denial Probability discussed \nbelow gives anindication ofsystem availability andtherefore, isincluded in \nthesetofDAMA system performanceparameters. \n3.2.2 User Information Transfer \nTheuser information transfer forallTDMA systems ishandled thesame way \nasforanyconnectlon-oriented digital communication system,Thepath through \nthesystem fortheuser's data does notchangefortheduration ofthecall. \nHowever,theparameters areaffected differently bythevarious TDMA systems, \nandnotallparameters pertain toallsystems. \nBitError Probability \nBit Error Probability istheprobability that atransmitted bitwill be \nreceived inerror. This isthe same asPeused inlink performance \nmeasurements andlink budget calculations oftypes AandBsatellite syste.,,s. \nAsBit Error Probability isone ofthe most: zommon measures ofdigital \ncommunication system performance, itisincluded inthe setofTDMA system \nperformance parameters. \nBitMisdellvery Probability \nBit Misdel_.very Probability isthe probabillty that asingleuser \ninformation bitisdelivered tothewrong destination. Inconnectlon-orlented \nsystems, likethevarious TDMA systems discussed, user information bitsfollow \nonly onepath through thesystem.Also, asTDMA systems process theuser data \ninmultibit subbursts, itisunlikely that asingle bit would bemisrouted. \nTherefore, Bit Misdelivery Probability isnot included intheset ofTDMA \nsystem performance parameters. \n301989010985-040\n\nBitLoss Probability \nThe BitLoss Probability istheprobability that auser information bit \nentering the system does notreach theintended destination. Again, asTDMA \nsystems areconnection-oriented, user information bits have only onepath to \nfollow. However, ifthe TDMA frame-synchronizing unique word (UW) isnot \ndetected for asignificant number offrames, the local terminal clock will \nbegin todrift, causing theframe boundaries toshift and theTDMA control \nbuff_ tooverflow, thus loosing user data bits. (Feher i1983] discusses \nuniqueword detection andprobabilities ofmissesandfalse alarms.) Also,if \ntheuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe earth station clock, a \n\"clock sllp\" can occur.This iswhen theclock reading data out ofaTDMA \nbuffer differs from theclock writing datainto thebuffer. Iftheread clock \nisslightly slower then thewrite clock, thebuffer will eventually overflow \nandhits will belost. Additionally, deep fades onthelink would cause large \nblocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost. BitLoss Probability isincluded inthe \nsetofTDMA system performance parameters. \nExtraBitProbability < \nTheExtra BitProbability istheprobability that areceived data bitwasa i \nduplicate bit orabit intended for another destination. Like the Bit I l\nMisdelivery Probability andBitLoss Probability, theExtra BitProbability is \nvery low for connection-oriented systems. However, ifthe TDMA frame- \nsynchronizing UWisdeclared present, when inreality itisnot, the TDMA \ncontrol buffer empties prematurely, thus sending extraneous orduplicate bits. \nAlso, extrabits can begenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheread clock is \nslightly faster then thewrite clock, thebuffer will empty, causing data bits \ntobeclocked outtwice andtobecounted asextra bits. \nThe Extra BitProbability and theBitLoss Probability give ameasure of \nthe UWdetector performance and the local earth station clock stability. \nTherefore, Extra Bit Probability isincluded inthe set ofTDMA system \nperformance perameters. \nBlockTransfer Time \nBlockTransfer TimeforTDMA systems isthetime required fordatablocks i! \ntobefeed into andtraverse thesystem. Thecounting ofBlock Transfer Time \n311989010985-041\n\nstarts with auser information block crossing the originating user/system \ninterface and ends when the same block crosses the destination user/system \ninterface. Any additional delay beyond the 270 mspropagation delay ofa \nsingle-hop satellite circuit and themodulation time gives ameasure ofthe \nadditional buffering required inTDMA systems. Therefore, Block Transfer Time \nisincluded inthesetofTDMA performance. \nBlock Error Probability \nBlock Error Probability isclosely related totheBit Error Probability, \ntheprobability that ablock ofuser information isreceived inerror. Oneor \nmore incorrect bits inablock constitute ablock error. Therefore, the \nmeasurement ofBlock Error Probability isalso included inthe TDMA system \nperformance parameters. \nBlock Misdelivery Probability \nBlock Misdelivery Probability isthe probability that areceived user \ninformation block was inteuded foranother destination. Theprimary cause of ?\nblock misdeliveries are undetected errors inthe circuit request address \ninformation orBTPgeneration anddistribution. Hewever, errors intheaddress \ninformation would cause anincorrect access and thus becounted inthe \nIncorrect Access Probability calculation. Errors inBTP generation and \ndistribution would allow TDMA bursts orsubbursts tobetransmitted atthe \nwrong time, misrouting data, andthus misdelivering auser's information block. \nHowever,asmentioned for the Incorrect Access Probability parameter, BTP \nerrors would cause the TDMAnetwork tolose synchronization and fail. \nTherefore, due toits low probability ofoccurrence, Block Misdelivery \nProbability isnotincluded inthesetofTDM_ system performance parameters. \nBlock Loss Probability \nBlock Loss Probability for TDMA systems isthe probability that an \ninformation block does notreach thedestination within tbespecified maximum \ntransfer time due toexcessively long transfer delays orlost blocks. The \nspecified maximum transfer time isthree times the Block Transfer Time \n(ANSI, 1983). Since the B]ock Transfer Time isexpected toberelatively \nconstant, theprimary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probabl]ity would be \n\nthesystem mlsrouting orloslng blocks. Hisrouting blocks wasdiscussed for \nBlock Misdeli_ery Probability. Losing blocks would belikely during deep fades \nonsystems notusing anyform ofARQprotocol. IfanARQprotocol isused, a \ntransmission error cancause anegative acknowledgement (NAK) tobechanged to \napositive acknowledgement (ACK),thus blocks requiring retransmission would be \nlost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware and software \"crashes\" \nwhere thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. Block Loss \nProbability isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. \nExtra Block Probability \nExtra Block Probability istheprobability that aduplicate block ofuser \ninformation isdelivered tothe destination user. Insystems using an \n_Qprotocol, anACKthat islost orchanged toaNAKcauses theunacknowledged \ninformation blocks tobcretransmitted. Extra Block Probability isincluded in \nthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. \nUser Information BitTransfer Rate \nTheUser Infor,aation BitTransfer Rate forTDMA systems isdefined asthe \ntotal number ofsuccessful bit transfers divided bythe time required to \ntransfer them. Itisthe same asthe Rbparameter used tospecify the \nthroughput oftypes AandBcommunication satellites. Because _heTDMA systems \nareconnection oriented,norate conversion occurs; thus, theinput andoutput \ndata rates areequal asrepresented bycase iofFigure 2.Therefore, either \ntheinput oroutput maybeexamined formeasuring thetransfer rate. TheUser \nInformation BitTransfer Rate isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance \nparameters.\nTransfer Denial Probability \nTransfer denial for TDMA systems isthe same as_or types Aand B \ncommunication satellite systems (see Section 3.1.2). Itoccurs when the \ntransmission quality ofthe link hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError \nProbability orUser Information BitTr_sfer Rate isworse than thespecified \nthreshold (see Section 2). Increased Peduetosunoutages andrain fades are \nagain theprimary cause.Because theUser Information BitRate isrelatively \nconstant,itwould not contribute totransfer denial. The limiting case of 1989010985-043\n\ntransfer denial probability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., \nI the system is\"down\" because ofanequipment failure. The Transfer Denial Probability issimilar totheOutage parameter used interrestrial microwave \nsystems and can bethought ofastheinverseofsystemavailability. \nTherefore,itisincluded inthesetofTDMA system performanceparameters. \n3.2.3 Disengagement \nDisengagement, like access, depends onthe specificnetwork design and \nuser/system interfaces. Also, llke access, disengagement isapplicableonly to \ntheDAMA systems generating BTPchanges inreal time. \nDisengagement Time \nDisengagement Time isthe elapsed time fromauser _ssuing acircuit \ndisconnection request towhen that user can make another circuit request. \nDisengagement Time isoneofthesignificant parameters forquantifying DAMA \nsystem performance because itgives anindication ofhow soon auser may \nestablish another circuit. ._ \nDisengagement Denial Probability \nDisengagement Denial Probability forDAMA systemsistheprobability that a \ncircuit isnotdisconnected after theusers have issued disengagement requests. \nTheprimary causes fordisengagement denial arethesame asthose forincorrect \naccess--errors inthe request orBTP generation and distribution. Because \nthese errors are rare due tothe network error detection and correction \ntechniques, Disengagement Denial Probability isnotincluded inthesetofDAMA \nsystem performance parameters. \n3.2.4 Ancillary Parameters \nThe ancillary parameters quantify theimpact onsystem performance due to \ntheuser's interaction with thesystem. The following discussion identifies \nandestimates theuser's influence onsystem performance, described bythefour \nancillary performance parameters, forthevarious TDMA systems. \nli UserFractionofAccessTime TheUser Fraction ofAccessTime isapplicabletoDAMA systems.Itisthe \ntime ittakes auser toissue anaccess request andenter the destination \n 34 \ni1989010985-044\n\naddress information (i.e., \"dial thenumber\"), andforthedestination user to \nanswer. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, this parameter \nwould besmall, thus Access Time would bedominated bythe DAMA system \noperation. But, iftheusers arehuman operators with telephones,Access Time \nwould bedominated bytheusers interactions. TheUser Fraction ofAccess Time \nindicates how much involvement theuser has inthe system operation. This \nparameter isincluded inthesetofDAMA system performance parameters. \nUser Fraction ofBlockTransfer Time \nTheUser Fraction offlock Transfer Time isthetime ittakes togenerate a \nblock ofuser's data. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, the \nuser information blocks areusually ready fortransfer;thus, theUser Fraction \nofBlock Transfer Time would besmall. However, ifthe users are human \noperators, where theblocks areassembled attheuser's terminal andtheblock \nassembly depends ontheoperator's typing speed, theUser Fraction ofBlock \nTransfer Time becomes asignificant part oftheoverall Block Transfer Time. \nBecause theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time islargely system independent \nitisnotincluded inthesetofTDMA systemperformance parameters. \nUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time \nTheUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time isthetime ittakes toenter and \nextract blocks ofuser data. Forcomputers transferring files,this parameter \nwould besmall. But,with human operators,typing and reading speed would \ndominate the input/output time. Because this parameter is_argely system \n_ndependent, itisnot included inthe set ofTDMA system performance \nparameters.\nUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time \nTheUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time isalso applicable only toDAMA \nsystems andisthetime ittakes auser toeetez adisengagement request. As \nwith theUser Fraction ofAccess Time, itisameasure ofhowmuch interaction \ntheuser has with thesystem. Therefore, itisincluded inthesetofDAMA \nsystem performance parameters. \n351989010985-045\n\n....-...._!_...._'!__' _\"_'_7_'_ _........_..-__i__-_._._!:__C_____-.o_._ ...... \"_-_== -........... \ni\n3.3 Satellite-Augmented ISDN Systems \nDemonstrations ofISDN service using satellite ].inks are currently under \nway. These areprimarily using thesatellite asatrunk between ISDN switches \noraswitch and the local user/network interface. For the broad bandwidth \ninterswitch trunks, simple type Aandtype Bcommunication satellites, orany \noftheTDMA systems areusable. Fortherelatively lowbandwidth links between \nISDN switches anduser/network interfaces, narrow-band TDMA systems using only \napart ofatransponder (Pritchard andSciulli, 1986) andvery-small-aperture \nterminals (VSATs) areappropriate. \nThe next step isfor the satellite itself tobecome anISDN switch. \nAdvanced satellites, like NASA's ACTS with onboard switching, (see Section 4) \nwould provide this capability. These satellites inaVSAT network would \nsupport ISDN user/network interfaces atthebasic 2B+D (144 kb/s) channel rate \norprimary 23B+D (1.544 Mb/s) channel rate. Broadband DAMA satellite systems \nwould provide broadband-ISDN connectivity between ISDN switches, oractasa \nb\"oadband-ISDN switch forinterconnecting high volume-users. \nWith co_unication satellite systems incorporated inISDN, itisuseful to \nexamine end-to-end system performance with tools such asANSX3.102. Work has \nalready begun inthis area with CCITT Recommendation G.821 foranend-to-end \nbit error rate (BER) ofix10.6onsatellite trunks for ISDN service \n(Ports, 1987). Theperformance oftheB-channels (connection oriented circuit \nswitched) canbequantified bytheperformance parameters identified forDAMA \nsatellite systems. Theperformance oftheD-channels (packet switched) will \nrequire thecomplete setof21performance parameters tofully describe their \nperformance.\nEnd-to-end system performance experiments for these satellite-augmented \nISDNs canbedesigned using theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. \nThese experiments would befundamentally the same asDAMAsatellite and \nACTS system performance experiments. \n4.ACTS OVERVIEW, OPERATION, ANDEND-TO-END SYSTEM \nP_FO_CE DEFINITIONS\nTheAdvanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) isthethird phase \nofthe NASA 30/20 GHz program. Phase one was thedevelopment ofadvanced \n30/20 GHzcommunication satellite technologies andlaboratory proof-of-concept \n36\ni1989010985-046\n\n(POC) models. Phase two was the development and refinement ofthese \ntechnologies forspace applications (Moy, 1986). Andphase three, ACTS, isthe \nflight test bed forverifying the technology developments ofthe first two \nphases. Some ofthetechnology developments demonstrate are: \nKa-band operation with 30GHz up-link and 20GHz down-link radio \nfrequency (RF) components \ndual power, 20GHz, space-qualified traveling wave tube amplifiers \n(TWTA)\nBaseband Processor (BBP) foronboard baseband switching oftheuser's \ndata traffic \ndemand assignment multiple access (DAMA) operation \nmultibeam communication package (MCP) with cross-polarized, scanning, \nspot beam antennas tofacilitate frequency reuse \nrain fade compensation via independent up-link anddown-link forward \nerror correction (FEC) coding andlink power control. \nNASA issponsoring the development and construction ofACTS. NASA will \nlaunch ACTS with thespace shuttle andprovide operational support during a \ntwo- tothree-year experiment period. ACTS will beavailable free ofcharge to \nprivate industry, universities, and local, state and Federal Government \nagencies forconducting experiments anddemonstrating the feasibility ofits \nadvanced systems. \nACTS isnot intended tobearevenue-generating communication satellite. \nItsprimary purpose istodemonstrate newtechnologies and ideas that maybe \nincorporated inanoperational advanced satellite system. The final \narchitecture andprotocols ofcommercia] systems maybevastly different from \nACTS. However, ACTS will provide astarting point for designing such an \nadvanced communication satellite systems. \nACTS will basically operate asaswitched digital communication network. \nAssuch, itbecomes desirable toquantify its performance from theuser's \nperspective. This will provide abasis for evaluating how acommercial \nadvanced communication satellite system performs from theuser's perspective \nandwill help identify theperformance impact ofthevarious ACTS technologies. \nThe primary focus ofthis section istopresent astandard method for \nquantifying ACTS system performance. \n371989010985-047\n\nThe section isdivided into three subsections. The first gives abrief \nsystem overview and operation description ofthe ACTS low burst rate \n(LBR) mode. Thesecond discusses howthe21ANSX3.102 performance parameters, \nintroduced inSection 2,relate toperformance oftheACTS LBRmode. Andthe \nthird discusses the basic design requirements for anACTS LBR system ! \nperformance experiment using theframework ofANSX3.141. \n4.1 ACTS Overview andOperation \nThis subsection provides abrief introductory description of the \nACTS LBRsystem and anoverview ofits operation. Inukai, etal. (1988), \nNaderi and Campanella (1988), and Wright (1986) offer additional in-depth \ninformation onthecapabilities andoperation ofACTS. \n4I.i ACTS LBRSystem Overview .\nTheACTS LBR system isatrue DAMA digital communication network using a _ii. \nl-ms TDMA frame format. Thenetwork isastar topology with thesatellite as :_ \nthecentral switching hubandtheindividual earth stations astheends. Itis \naconnection oriented. Theuser's data aresent inpacket-like segments with \naddress and control fields, butsince there isonly one switching node, the \npacket path does notchange from packet topacket. The address andcontrol \nfields ofthepackets form an\"order wire,\" functioning like thecommon channel \ninteroffice signaling systems used bylong-haul carriers. Through theorder \nwires, theuser's request service, in64kb/s increments, from 64kb/s upto \napproximately 6.1 Mb/s. Therefore, from the user's per_-ective the ACTS \nnetwork behaves more like acircuit-switched network then apacket network. \nAnother advanced technology feature ofACTS isthemultibeam communication \npackage (MCP). Multiple small uoverage area (approximately 150kmindiameter) \nspot and scanning beam antennas with cross polarization areused instead of \nglobal orwide area coverage antennas. This allows greater frequency reuse and \nhigher gain antennas onthesatellite. Figure 6illustrates theproposed ACTS \ncoverage area. During each l-ms TDMA frame, all earth stations requiring \nservice are illuminated. Like true DAMA satellite systems, theACTS circuit \nrouting andcoverage area canbeprogramed inreal time toaccommodate changes \ninuser traffic demands. \n3819890109851048\n\n391989010985-049\n\nDuring each TDMA frame thespot beam (orscanning beam inthescan sector) \nstops (dwells) oneach area with active earth stations. During thedwell, each \nearth station transmits and receives itsuser traffic. Onthe terrestrial \nside, theearth stations receive acontinuous data stream from theusers (upto \n6.144 Mb/s or96equivalent 64kb/s voice circuits). Theearth stations buffer \nand segment this incoming data into 64-bit-long words. These words are \npackaged into messages. Atapredetermined slot inthe TDMA frame, the \nmessages aretransmitted inaii0Mb/s burst. These bursts arereceived atthe \nsatellite, demodulated and demultiplexed back tothe 64kb/s baseband, and \nstored intheBBP input memory. During thenext frame, the contents ofthe \nmemory aretransferred through theBBP routing switch totheappropriate BBP \noutput memory. Then during thethird frame, thecontents oftheBBPoutput \nmemory are transmitted inaii0 Mb/s burst inaTDM fashion during the \nappropriate down link spot dwell. Thus, ittakes three TDMA frames (3ms)for \nthesignal tobeprocessed through thesatellite. TheACTS system will operate \ninboth point-to-point andpr_nt-to-multipoint (broadcast) modes. \nAnother ACTS techno _ demonstration isindependent rain fade compensation \n for the uplink and down link. This isdone with adaptive forward error \ncorrection (FEC) coding andburst rate reduction. Forexample, ifarain fade \nisdetected onthe uplink, theuplink signal isencoded with arate-I/2 \ncenvolutional code andtransmitted atareduced burst rate, thus increasing the \nlink budget margin. When ::hesignal isdemodulated onboard thesatellite, it \nisdecoded andtheoriginal baseband bits arerecovered. Iffade compensation \nisrequired onthedown link, thesignal isencoded onboard thesatellite and \ntransmitted atalower burst rate tothe destination earth station, again \nincreasing thelink budget margin. Since itisunlikely that theoriginating \nterminal uplink and destination terminal down link will suffer rain fades \nsimultaneously, thesignal isonly encoded onthelink that requires it;the \nclear link istransmitted uncoded atthenormal burst rate. \nWith onboard signal regeneration, FECcoding, andburst rate reduction, it \nispossible tosupport single-hop VSAT-to-VSAT communications. With type Aand \nBcommunication satellite systems, ifaVSAT wishes tocommunicate with another \nVSAT, thetraffic must first berouted toalarge central hubterminal where it \nisregenerated and retransmitted tothedestination VSAT. This involves two \nsatellite hops, thus increasing the propagation delay and making voice \n401989010985-050\n\ncommunications difficult (Glen etal., 1976). However, with ACTS, the \nsatellite performs thefunction ofthecentral hub station, thus reducing the \nnumber ofh)ps andfacilitating acceptable voice communication. \n4.1.2 ACTS LBRSystem Operation \nTheACTS LBRsystem uses portions oftheTDMA frame asorder wire channels \ntocarry network control information. Figure 7shows theflow ofthis control \ninformation through the various TDM_ bursts ofthe uplink and down link \nframes. Figures 8and9show theuplink anddown link TDMA frame structure in \ngreater detail, illustrating dwell time slot andfade control allocations. \nTheuplink TDMA frame (Figure 8)starts inMCPspot dwell time slot number \nonewith acontrol burst (CB) from themaster control station (MCS). The CB \ncontains thecontrol instructions fortheBBPdata routing processor (DRP) and \noutbound order wire information from theMCStotheuser earth stations. The \nCBistransmitted with FECcoding. \nNext are the uncoded traffic bursts (UTB's) from the active user earth \nstations. TheUTB's contain theinbound order wire information andtheuser's \ndata traffic. OneUTBperframe issent from theNASA ground station (NGS) and \neach active user station. Ifthe NGS orauser station needs fade \ncompensation, theMCS instructs ittomove thetraffic bursts tothe\"Pooled \nFade Control Slots\" shown inFigure 8(b)and tosend itasacoded traffic \nburst (CTB). These bursts contain theinbound order wire andterminal traffic \nbutaretransmitted during thespecial time slots with rate 1/2FECcoding and \nreduced burst rate. \nThefinal burst intheuplink TDMA frame isthetransmit acquisition burst \n(TAB) sent from user earth stations first entering thenetwork. TheTAB is \nused forearth station timing acquisition andnetwork synchronization. Like \ntheCBtheTABisalso FECcoded. \nThe down link TDMA frame (Figure 9)starts inMCP spot dwell time slot \nnumber onewith theorder wire burst (OWB) totheMCS. TheOWBcontains the \nBBPstatus messages andanaggregate oftheinbound order wire information from \nalltheactive user earth stations. TheOWBJsalways sent with FECcoding. \nNext isthe reference burst (RB) containin Fthe outbound order wire \ninformation and tracking error words (TEW's) foreach earth station. (The \nTEW's areused forkeeping theearth stations synchronized with thenetwork.) \n41989010985-051\n\n1989010985-052\n\ni,.,III\n__J1989010985-053\n\n/t:_t1989010985-054\n\nThe RBisalso FECcoded. Following theRBisthedown link traffic burst \n(DTB) carrying aJlthedown link traffic forthat particular dwell area.As \nshown inFigure 9(a), there isanRBandDTBforeach dwell time slot. As \nshown inFigure 9(b), when anearth station inaparticular dwell area needs \nfade compensation, itscoded traffic isappended totheRBandmoved toadown \nl_nk fade control slot. Theuncoded traffic fortheother user earth stations \nistransmitted intheir normal time slots. \nThefinal down link burst isthereceive acquisition burst (RAB). This is \ntransmitted touser earth stations first entering thenetwork. Like theup \nlink TAB, theRAB isused forearth station timing acquisition andnetwork \nsynchronization.. TheRABisalso FECcoded. \nTheACTS LBRTDMA frame isdivided into 1728 slots orwords, each 64bits \nlong, equating tothe110.592 Mb/s transmission rate. Every 75th frame (every \n75ms)isdeclared asuperframe. TbeMCSsends oneoutbound order wire message \nper frame, user earth stations send one inbound order wire message per \nsuperframe.\nFigure 10 shows the time sequence for establishing, using, and \ndisconnecting a64kb/s _CTS LBR circuit. The sequence begins with auser \nsignaling theoriginating user earth st_tion thathe/she wishes toplace a \ncall. Theoriginating user's earth station transmits, via theinbound order \nwire, acircuit requestmessage containing thedestination user's earth station \nidentification number and the circuitidentification number. The circuit \nidentification number isused toidentify thecircuit throughout itsexistence \nandconsists oftheterrestrial channel number andtheoriginating user's earth \nst_zion identification number. Thecircuit request message also hasastation- \nco-station communications field forterrestrial circuit signaling information. \nAfter receiving and processing the circuit request message, the MCS \nallocates uplink anddown link capacity andassigns TDMA frame slots. Italso \nstores thi:_ assignment information inanactive circuit tile listing the \ncurrent resources allocated toeach circuit inthenetwork. Itthen sends a \nc_rcuit assignment message via the outbound order wire tothe circuits \noriginating anddestination earth stations. This message contains thecircuit \nidentification number, destination terminal number, uplink anddown link slot i \nassignments, and down link portion ofthe station-to-station terrestrial ! \ncircuit signaling information. _ \n45 i 1989010985-055\n\n_ USEREARTHTERMINAL k'(CS USEREARTI'ITERMINAL \ni User\u0000System Interface User/System Interface \n;\nAccessRequest CircuitRequest \n0/4)\nCircuitAssignment._...___..._Circuit Assignment \n BBPConfiguration \"_ \nBTPExecute_\n(\" SignalUser• T • \n(o12)\nUserCommits\n------\"---\"(216) ..,.,.......,....- \"\"\" \nReceiveCommitment ......-__......-----\"--\" (2) • IL._ \n•(0/2) (2) \nStartCommunication _ (5,6161 \"--\"\"-\"-------__._ -..,,.\n(s8) ---_.__._--_---._,• ' ReceiveCommunication \nEndCommunication (5,6) \" r • (o13) \n(o/2) -__-._ \n(7) \"\"\"-----.__..

The \nMCS initiates these modifications bysending outbound order wire burst \nassignment andburst slot move messages totheaffected earth stations. Also, \nthe BBP isinstructed toupdate its BBP traffic route time plan (BBPTP), \nreroutlng thereassigned bursts. Themodified BTPandBBPTP arestored until \nthe MCS issues the BTP execute command, thus initiating the changes and \nestablishing thenewcircuits. IftheMCSisunable tocomplete therequest no \ncircuit assignment message issent, the originating user will eventually \nabandon thecall ifitisnotconnected. \nTheusers initiate thecircuit disconnect process bysignaling their earth \nstation. Thedisconnecting earth station issues acircuit disconnect message, \ncontaining thecircuit identification number, viatheinbound order wire. The \nstation then waits for adisconnect acknowledgement from the MCS before \n disconnecting thecircuit. \n When theMCSreceives thecircuit disconnect request, itchecks theactive \n$ circuit file for the circuit identified. Ifthe circuit islisted, the \ndisconnect message isvalid andtheMCSproceeds with thedisconnectprocess. \nThe MCS sends adisconnect acknowledgment message toboth earth stations \ncarrying the circuit, instructing them todisconnectthe circuit. Ifthe \ncircuit listed inthe circuitdisconnectmessage isnot intheMCS active \ncircuitf_le, themessage isdiscarded. IftheMCSneeds theTDMA frame space \ntoaccommodate newcircuit requests, itwill develop anddistribute anewBTP. \nIfitdoes not need the frame space freed bythedisconnect request, the \ncurrent BTPisnotchanged. \nLarge trunk circuits are established bymaking multiple requests for \n64kb/s circuits. Each request contains thesame circuitconnectparameters \nbuthas aunique circuit identification number. The trunk isnot available \nuntil all the circuit assignments have been received and implemented. A \nsimilar procedure applies todisconnecting thetrunk. Disconnect requests for \neach 64kb/s circuit comprising thetrunk isprocessed separately. \nBroadcast connections aresimilarly established, except thecircuit request \nmessages contain the same circuit identification number but with different \ndestination station numbers. Aswith the trunk circuits, the broadcast \nconnection cannot beused until a11 the circuits have been established, \nDisengagement ismore involved, Ifanonoriginating user wishes todisconnect, \n4'/1989010985-057\n\nthat circuit isdisconnected but theremaining circuits arestill active. \nHowever, iftheoriginating user disconnects, allcircuits aredisconnected. \n4.2 ACTS LBRSystem Performance Parameters \nInorder touse the ANS X3.102 performance parameters toquantify the \nperformance ofadvanced communication satellite systems such asACTS, the \nrelationship andapplicability ofthe21ANSX3.102 performance parameters to \nthesatellite system operation must beinvestigated. Aswasdone inSection 3 \nfor the various Tbe_ satellite communication systems, each ANS X3.102 \nperformance parameter isexamined andrelated totheACTS LBRmode operation. \nIncluded inthis discussion isthe examination ofhow and towhat extent \nvarious mechanisms within the ACTS LBR system affect theestimates for the \nperformance parameters. Table 5identifies theperformance parameters deemed \napplicable totheACTS LBRsystem. \n4.2.1 Access \nThe exact method ofuser access tothe ACTS LBR system depends onthe \nspecific user/system interface used. The originating user requests a \nconnection then waits until thecircuit isestablished andthedestination user \nhasanswered before transmitting anydata. Since theACTS LBRsystem isatrue \nDAMA satellite system generating new BTPs inreal time, access function \nperformance isofinterest. \nGeneric descriptions ofthefour performance parameters associated with the \naccess function are given inSection 2,Seitz and Grubb (1983), and \nANSI (1983). \nAccess Time \nAccess Time fortheACTS LBRsystem istheelapsed time from auser issuing \naservice request tothestart oftheuser's data transmission. Itisassumed \nthat theuser's earth station issynchronized tothenetwork; thus, only the \ncall request _ust beprocessed. Asdescribed inSection 4.1.2, thecircuit is \navailable foruseonly after thenewBTPhasbeen implemented. Ifmany circuit \nrequests must beprocessed, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil allofthe \nrequests canbeserved. Thus, Access Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic \nload, the number ofconnection/disengagement requests, and the number of \n481989010985-058\n\n49IIIIHIIIIIII- -HillI_'_'\"_'\"_\" '+'_e-':'+\" :\"_...... \n1989010985-059\n\nstations requiring FEC coding (FEC coding requires additional BTP changes). \nAccess Time isone ofthe most significant ACTS LBR system performance \nparameters andistherefore included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance \n| parameters.\nIncorrect Access Probability \nIncorrect Access would occur intheACTS LBRsystem ifthere areundetected \nbit errors inthe inbound order wire address information totheMCS orthe \nBBPTP information from theMCStotheDRP. However, because cyclic redundancy \ncodes (CRC) are used within the order wire and control information fields, \nundetected errors would befew. WRen anerror isdetected, therequest is \nignored andaccess isdenied. Therefore, because ofthis lowprobability of \noccurrence and thedifficulty inmeasuring thenumber ofincorrect accesses, \ntheIncorrect Access Parameter isnot included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem \nperformance parameters. \nAccess Denial Probability \nAccess denial for the ACTS LBR system would occur when the system is \noperating close tocapacity andthus would notbeable tosupport anadditional \ncircuit. Inthis case theBTPmaynotbeable toaccept anyadditional user \ntraffic, orthe source ordestination earth stations might not beable to \naccommodate theextra bandwidth required foranadditional circuit. System \ncapacity isreduced aud thus Access Denial Probability isincreased ifany \nI earth stations intheparticular dwell area require fade compensation. Also, ifthe destination earth station does not have any terrestrial circuits \navailable, itwill block thecall (byissuing adisengagement request). \nMinor system/component failures would also cause Access Denial, e.g., the \ndestination earth station is\"down\" ornot yet synchronized tothenet .rk. \nAdditionally, biterrors ontheinbound order wire during acapacity request \nwould cause theMCStoignore therequest, thus denying access. \n! Access Denial due toexcessive delays ispassible. The threshold for T\naccess denial, asshown inFigure i,isdefined asthree times themean system \ni Access Time. Therefore, under excessively heavy traffic conditions thecall \n,_{ request processing time oftheMCS may exceed this threshold, thus denying \n501989010985-060\n\nT3\n?\naccess. Also, iftheMCSdetermines that thecall cannot becompleted, the \nrequest isdiscarded. \nMeasuring theAccess Denial Probability isuseful fordetermining thetrue \nsystem capacity andidentifying hardware andsoftware bottle necks. Therefore, \nItisincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \nAccessOutage Probability \nAccess outages intheACTS LBRsystem canoccur foranumber ofreasons: \ntheoriginating user's earth station is\"down;\" thecapacity requestmessages \narerejected duetohigher channel error rate from aheavy, local rain storm; \nthe MCS isnot operational; orthe satellite isscheduled for some other \nexperiment andthus notavailable forLBRuse. \nIdeally, inafully operational system, worst-case values fortheAccess \nOutage Probability would beinthe range ofI0-Itoi0-_(Seitz and \nGrubb, 1983). Inanonrevenue generating system such asACTS, theAccess \nOutage Probability isexpected tobehigher because ofitsexperime_ital nature; \nhowever, theconsequences ofaccess outage arenot assevere asfor revenue \ngenerating networks. Therefore, Access Outage Probability isnot included in \nthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \n4.2.2 User Information Transfer \nThe user information transfer for the ACTS LBR system islike other \nconnection oriented digital communication systems. Thepath throu6n thesystem \nfortheuser's data does nutchange fortheduration ofthecall. \nThe ANS X3.102 block-oriented user information transfer parameters are \nassociated with transporting user defined information units. Normally users \ndefine block lengths that arecompatible with their data processing equipment \norhigher layer protocols, regardless ofhowthecommunication system packages \ntheir data. However, because theACTS LBRsystem handles alldata in64-bit \nincrements, when looking atsystem level performance, ablock isdefined as \n64user bits. This does notseverely limit theusefulness ofthese performance \nparameters asmost common user defined blocks areinteger multiples of64bits. \nGeneric descriptions oftheiiperformance parameters associated with the \nuser information transfer function are given inSection 2and inSeitz and \n511989010985-061\n\ni Grubb (1983). These bit and block parameters are transfer described\nmathematically inANSI (1983). \nBitError Probability \nThe Bit Error Probabi]ity isthe same parameter that isused inlink \nperformance measurements andlink power budget calculations oftypes AandB \nsatellite systems. Itisafunction ofthechannel signal-to-noise ratio and \ntransmission rate (see Appendix). The ACTS LBR system has aBit Error \nProbability design goa] of]0-6 Because BitError Probability isoneofthe \nmost common measures ofdigital communication system performance itisincluded \ninthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \nBitMisdelivery Probability \nInconnection o_iented systems, such asACTS, once auser information bit \nenters the system ithas only on_ path tofollow and thus will reach the \ndesired destination. Also, because theACTS LBRsystem handles theuser data \nin64bit blocks, itwo1:id bevery unlikely that asingle bit would be \nmisrouted. Therefore, BitMisdelivery Probability isnotincluded intheset \nofACTS performance parameters. \nBitLoss Probability \nAgain, once auser information bitenters thesystem ithasonly onepath \ntofollow. However, iftheuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe \nlocal earth station clock, ortheearth station clock isnotsynchronized with \nACTS, a\"clock slip\" canoccur.Iftheread clock isslightly slower then the \nwrite clock, thebuffer will eventually fill andlose bits. Additionally, deep \nfades onthelink would cause large blocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost, thus \ncontributing tothevalue ofthis parameter. \nEven though theprobability oflosing abitintheACTS LBRsystem islow, \nBitLoss Probabi].ity isincluded inthesetofsystem performance parameters. \nCoupled with theBitError Probability, theBitLoss Probability gives agood \nindication ofthe transmission link performance and thesystems immunity to \nfades.\n521989010985-062\n\nExtra BitProbability \nLike theBitMisdelivery Probability andBit loss Probability, theExtra \nBitFrobability isvery lowforconnection oriented systems.However, extra \nbits canbegenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheearth station's terrestrial \ninterface elastic buffer read clock isslightly faster then thewrite clock, \nthebuffer will empty, causing data bits tobeclocked outtwice andcounted as \nextra bits. \nEven though the probability ofreceiving anextra bit intheACTS LBR \nsystem islow, the Extra Bit Probability isincluded inthe set ofsystem \nperformance parameters. \n Block Transfer Time \n Block Transfer Time counting starts when the first bit ofauser \n': information block crosses theoriginating user/system interface andends when \n,._: thesameblock crosses thedestination user/'system interface. Block Transfer \n!i Time isoneofthe significant ACTS LBRperformance parameters andtherefore \nincluded inthesetofparameters. \nBlock Error Probability \nDuetotheblock processing nature ofACTS, ifabiterror occurs, then by \n definition ablock error also occurs. Therefore, themeasurement ofBlock \ni Error Probability isalso included inthe ACTS LBR system performance \nparameters.\nBlock Misdelivery Probability \nThemain causes forblock misdelivery intheACTS LBRsystem areerrors in \nthedestination address information orswitch control commands.These would be \nundetected errors inthedestination address field oftheoriginating station's \ninbound order wire orerrors inthecontrol link from theMCStotheBBP's DRP. \nErrors intheBBPcontrol link would cause theBBPtomisroute thedata, thus \n_: contributing toBlock Misdelivery. However, errors intheaddress information \n:!\nwould cause anIncorrect Access and _hus becounted inthe Incorrect Access \ni\n Probability calculation. \n\"i Theprobability ofundetected errors intheorder wire address field orBBP \ncontrol link arevery lowbecause oftheCRCandFECcoding. Therefore, the \n_. 53 1989010985-063\n\nBlock Misdelivery Probability oftheACTS LBK system isexpected tobelow. \nBecause ofthis andthedifficulty ofcollecting enough data tocalculate the \nprobability with ahigh degree ofreliability, the Block Misdelivery \nProbability isnot included inthe set ofACTS LBR system performance \nparameters.\nBlock Loss Probability \nThe primary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probability would be \nmisrouted orlost blocks. Block loss would bepossible during deep \ntransmission link fades. Since theACTS LBRsystem does notuseanyform of \nARQ protocol, blocks transmitted during adeep fade would be lost. \nAdditionally, iftheusers areusing anARQprotocol andatransmission error \ncauses aNAKtobechanged toanACK, anyblocks requiring retransmission would \nbelost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware andsoftware \"crashes\" \nwhere thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. \nTheBlock Loss Probability fortheACTS LBRsystem isexpected tobelow, \nwith themain cause being transmission fades. Block Loss Probability isan \neasy parameter tomeasure and therefore isincluded inthe set ofACTS LBR \nsystem performance parameters. \nExtra Block Probability \nBecause theACTS LBR system isconnection oriented anddoes notuse any \nform ofARQprotocol, there islittle chance forextra blocks tobegenerated \nbythesystem. Oneprobable case, however, would beiftheBBP's output memory \nwas read twice before being overwritten with newdata. Amore likely cause \nwould beauser emplo_ .aganARQprotocol where anACKislost orchanged toa \nNAK, causing the unacknowledged, but error free information blocks tobe \nretransmitted.\nSince thelikelihood oftheACTS LBRsystem generating anextra block is \nlowandconcerns about theperformance ofuser's ARQprotocol areoutside the \nACTS LBR system, the Extra Block Probability isnot included intheset of \nACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \n541989010985-064\n\nUser Information BitTransfer Rate \nFortheACTS LBRsystem theUser Information BitTransfer Rate isthebasic \nuser rate of64kb/s, where the input rate and output rate are equal as \nrepresented bycase iofFigure 2.Therefore, User Information BitTransfer \nRate isincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \nTransfer Denial Probability \nTransfer Denial for the ACTS LBR system occurs when the transmission \nquality ofthelink hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError Probability or \nUser Information Bit Transfer Rate are worse than aspecified threshold. \nANSI (1983) defines this threshold fortheBitError Probability asthefourth \nroot ofitsspecified value, andfortheUser Information BitTransfer Rate as \none third ofitsspecified value. Sunoutages and rain fades cause theBit \nError Probability toincrease, thus contributing totransfer denial. The \nlimiting case oftransfer denial iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, \ni.e., the system is\"down\" due toequipment orsoftware failure. Transfer \nDenial Probability canbethought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. \nBecause system availability isoften used tospecify communication s_te]lite \nsystem performance, Transfer Denial Probability becomes avaluable parameter \nandistherefore included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \n4.2.3 Disengagement \nThedisengagement function fortheACTS LBRsystem isthesame asforother \nconnection oriented data communication system. Generic descriptions oithetwo \nperformance parametecs associated wit:h thedisengagement function aregiven in \nSection 2and inSeitz and Grubb (1983). These parameters are described \nmathematically inANSI (1983). \nDisengagement Time \nThe counting ofDisengagement Time for theACTS LBR system starts when \nusers signal their earth station that:they wish todisengage the call. The \nuser's earth station then issues aCircuit Disconnect message totheMCSvia \ntheinbound order wire. TheMCSinturnissues aDisconnect Acknowledgment to \ntheearth stations viatheoutbound order wire. Thecounting ofDisengagement \nTime ends when theusers issue another access request,Ifthere are manv \n5b1989010985-065\n\ncircuit requests, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil alltherequests are \nprocessed; thus, Disengagement Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic load, the \nnumber ofconnection/disengagement requests, andnumber ofterminals requiring \nFECcoding. Disengagement Time isasignificant performance parameter relating \ntotheACTS LBRsystem performance. Therefore, itisincluded inthesetof \nACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \nDisengagement Denial Probability \nDisengagement denial for the ACTS LBRsystem could occur due to \ntransmission bit errors during aCircuit Disconnect request orDisconnect \nAcknowledgment. IftheMCS receives aninvalid Circuit Disconnect request, \ni.e., thecircuit identified intherequest isnotontheactive circuit list, \ntherequest isignored. Theearth station issuing therequest will repeat the \ndisengagement request ifitdoes notreceive aDisconnect Acknowledgment within \naspecified time. During deep fades, several Circuit Disconnect requests could \nbeissued before theMCS acknowledges. Thus, there isthepossibility that a \nDisengagement Denial would bedeclared due toexcessive request pro_essing \ndelay.\nBecause theACTS LBR system uses CRCs ontheorder wire commands andFEC \ncoding during fades, Disengagement Denial Probability would beinsignificant. \nTherefore, Disengagement Denial Probability isnot included inthe set of \nACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. \n4.2.4 Ancillary Parameters \nBecause these parameters rely entirely ontheuser, they arenotincluded \ninthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. This isnot toimply \nthat they areunimportant. Anestimate oftheir impact onsystem performance \nisuseful for identifying performance problems and developing methods to \nimprove the systems ease ofuse. The following discussion identifies and \nroughly estimates some oftheuser's influence onsystem performance forthe \nfour ancillary performance parameters. \nUser Fraction ofAccess Time \nThe User Fraction ofAccess Time fortheACTS LBR system isthetime it \ntakes the originating user toinput the destination address information \n561989010985-066\n\n(i.e., \"dial thenumber\") and destination user toanswer. This can take a \nsignificant amount oftime astheACTS LBRsystem uses a\"four-way handshake\" \nprotocol toestablish acircuit. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring \nfiles, this parameter would besmall andAccess Time would bedominated bythe \nACTS LBR system. Iftheusers arehuman operators with telephones, theUser \nFraction ofAccess Time would bethedominant portion ofAccess Time. \nUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time \nIftheusers arehost computers transferring files, theuser information \nblocks areready fortransfer; thus, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time \nwould bevery small. Ifthey arehuman operators, andtheuser information \nblocks areassembled attheuser's terminal, theblock assembly depends onthe \noperator's typing speed. 'f_'_s, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time can \nbecome asignificant part oftheoverall Block Transfer Time. \nUser Fraction ofinput/Output Time \nWith computers transferring files, this parameter would besmall. IIowever, \nwith human operators, typing andreading speed would dominate theinput/output \ntime.\nUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time \nOnce auser hasissued adisconnect request,theACTS \"BRsystem processes \nthe request and disengages the circuit. The only user dependency ishow \nquickly thedisengagement request isentered into thesyste:a. \nTable 5identifies the system performance parameters applicable _or \nquantifying the ACTS LBR system performance. Theparameters not deemed \napplicable describe relatively rare system performance outcomes, andtypically \nrequire long observation periods andmore elaborate measurement equipment to \ngather enough data toesti_nate kh_parameter with high confidence. [nmany \ncases theeffects ofthese rareevents alsoaffect common system perform_mce \noutcomes, e.g.,BitError Probability, andarethusalready accounted for. \nThis isnottoimply that: only theparameters identified areuseful for \nquantifying system performance. Wit:h enot,gh resources (.'ime, money, \npersonnel), measurement experiments using all21ANSX3.102para,neters could be \nconducted.1989010985-067\n\n4.3 ACTS System Performance Experiment Design Considerations \nTwoANSX4.141 measurement objectives areproposed foranACTS LBRsystem \nperformance experiment: absolute performance characterization (i.e., determine \nthe system performance baseline); and analysis offactor effects (i.e., \ndetermine how different system configurations affect the overall system \nperformance). Table 6lists some ofthe ACTS LBR system factors (system \nconfigurations) andtheir levels that could bemeasured. Themost significant \nfactors arethedifferent data rates, theeffect ofthefade compensation, and \nperformance asafunction oftraffic load. \n4.3.1 ACTS User/System Interfaces \nThefirst task when designing auser-oriented system pe_formance experimeht \nistoidentify theuser/system interface. Figure iiillustrates thebasic \nACTS LBRuser/system interfaces options. The primary interface point isthe \nACTS Central Office (CO) equipment, which looks and functions like a \nterrestrial, telephone system central office. Thespecific u.._r interface data \nrates andprotocols depend oiltheinterface options implemented int,,eACTS CO, \nbut thebasic intent isforACTS toappear totheusers like aterrestrial \ntelephone system. Theuser goes \"off hook\" (orinstructs their modem togooff \nhook), receives a\"dial tone,\" dials thenumber, hea_-s a\"ring-back\" fr_m t_,_ \ndestination, andwaits forthedestina_:ion user toanswer. \nThephysical _?ference between ACTS andterrestr',:] telephone systems ends \natthe_r;er/system interface. Asshown inFigure i],thehost computer inthe \nearth station performs thecontrol functions inplace ofahuman cverator or \nstand-alone computer controlling the(:Oequipment.

The following isa \n mapping oftheACTS system operation into these reference events. \n[\ni Access Request \nAnAccess Request occurs whenthe originating user signals the earth \nstation that he/she wishes tocall another user. Theoriginating user's earth \nstation then formats and transmits acircuit request message, which contains \nthedestination address, via itsinbound order wire totheMCS. Acircuit is \nestablished following theprocess outlined inSection 4.1.2. Theoccurrence of \nanaccess request signifies thestart oftheaccess time measurement. \nNonoriginating User Commitment \nTheoriginating user receives a\"ring-back\" signal while thedestination \nuser isbeing signaled. The Nonoriginating User Commitment occurs when the \nnonoriginating (destination) user answers the call. Incorrect access is \neliminated asapossible access outcome when the desired destination user \nanswers thecall. \nSystemBlocking Signal \nSystem Blocking Signals areissued only when theoriginating user's earth \nstation cannot accommodate theca]l. Theoriginating user isnotnotified if \nthecall isblocked within theACTS LBRsystem (destination earth stations or \ni MCS). IftheMCScannot process thecall request, therequest isignored and \ntheoriginating user will eventually abandon thecall. \nUser Blocking Signal \nAUser Blocking Signal isissued when thedestinationuser iseither busy \n(the originating user receives a\"busy tone\") ordoes notanswer.Asdefined \ninANSI (1983),acall attempt blocked bythedestination user isexc]uded from \nthesystem performance measurements. \ni\n!1989010985-071\n\nStart ofBlockInput ToSystem \nThe Start ofBlockInput toSystemoccurs when the first bit ofuser \ninformation crosses theoriginating user/systeminterface. Themeasurement of \naccess time isstopped when this event occurs. \nStart ofBlockTransfer \nBecause theACTS LBR system isconnection-oriented, the Start ofBlock \nTransfer coincides with the Start ofBlock Input tothe system. The \nmeasurement ofblock transfer time isstarted when this event occurs. \nEndofBlock Transfer \nThe End ofBlock Transfer occurs when the last bit oftheuser-defined \ninformation block crosses the destination user/system interface. The \nmeasurement ofblock transfer time isstopped when this event occurs. \nDisengagement Request \nADisengagement Request occurs when either theoriginating ordestination \nuser signals his/her earth station todisconnect thecall. Theearth station \nthen formats and transmits acircuit disconnect message via theinbound order \nwire totheMCS. Theearth station originating thedisconnect request waits \nfor con[irmation from the MCS before taking any further action. If \nconfirmation does not arrive before atime out expires, the earth station \nretransmits the circuit disconnect message. The first Disengagement Request \nissued signifies thestart ofthedisengagement time measurement. \nDisengagement Confirmation \nUpon reception ofacircuit disconnect message, the MCS determines the \nvalidity oftherequest bychecking its list ofactive circuits forthe one \nidentified inthedisconnect message. Ifthecircuit isonthelist, theMCS \nsends adisconnect acknowledgment message viatheoutbound order wire toboth \nearth stations using the circuit. Ifthe circuit isnot onthe list, the \ncircuit disconnect message isdiscarded. TheDisengagement Confirmation allows \nboth users toplace other calls. The measurement ofdisengagement time is \nstopped when the user making the originaldisengagement request isable to \npla__.other ca]is. \n6219890109R5-077\n\n4.3.3Typical ACTSLBRSession \nTheabovereference events areextremely useful fordeveloping call session \nprofiles. With these session profiles and details about the specific \nuser/system interfaces, the relevant interfaceevents needed for the data \nextraction step ofthemeasurement process canbeidentified. \nAsystem level session profileforatypical ACTS LBRcall isillustrated \ninFigure I0, with the applicable primary and ancillary reference events \nidentified. (see ANSI [1987] foradiscussion onancillary reference events.) \nInthis session, theoriginating user initiates thecall, transfers data, and \nthen disengages thecall. Nouser data oracknowledgments aretransferred from \nthedestination user back totheoriginating user. Figure 12illustrates in \ngreater detail theACTS LBRsystem actions during asuccessful access request. \nThesession begins with theoriginating user going \"off hook,\" thus issuing \nanAccess Request (primary reference event I)asthe interface event. The \noriginating user receives a\"dial tone\" from thelocal ACTS CO,indicating that \nhe/she may enter the destination user's address. The system processes the \nrequest, signaling the destihation user. The originating user receives a \n \"ring-back\" indicating that thedestination user isbeing signaled.There are \n noprimary reference events associated with this system event atthe \n originating user's interface. \n.I Thedestination user co_,_its tothesession byanswering thecall (going \n \"off hook\"),thus initiating reference event 2astheinterface event.The \noriginating user receives theindication that thedestinatlon user iswilling \ntocommunicate. Again there isnoprimary reference event associated with this \ninterface event. \nThe originating user starts the communication secsion, thus initiating \nreference events 5and6.There isnoprimary reference event defined forthe \ninterface event ofthedestination user receiving thedata. \nThecommunication session continues inthis fashion until thelast bitof \nuser information has been transferred across the origination user/system \ninterface. Asshown inFigure I0andingreater detail inFigure 13,after the \nlast bit ofuser information has entered the system, the originating user \nissues adisconnect request (primary reference event 8),toitslocal interface \n(user goes \"onhook\" When thedestination user receives this last bitofthe \n631989010985-073\n\n641989010985-074\n\n1989010985-075\n\nuser data, reference event7hasoccurred. Thedestination user then issues a \ndisconnectrequesttoitslocal interface. \nFinally, after processing the disconnectrequests, the MCS issues a \ndisconnectacknowledgment (primary reference event9)toboth user's earth \nstations. Ifthere isaneed toaccommodate additional circuitrequests, the \nMCS will develop and distribute anew BTP. Atthis time the system is \navailable foranother call. \nSession profiles similar toFigures i0,12,and 13canbedrawn forthe \nACTS LBRsystem high-volume trunk andbroadcast modes. Themain difference is \nthe need for multiple access and disconnectrequests toestablish the extra \ncircuits.\nAccess requests canbeblocked atseveral locations intheACTS LBRsystem, \nthus contributing tothe Access Denial Probability and Access Outage \nProbability discussed inSection 4.2.1. Acause ofaccess blocking isshovel in \nFigure 14where theMCSignores thecircuit request. This would beduetothe \nsystem operating close tooratcapacity orthecircuit request message was \nreceived inerror and thus ignored. Inthis case theoriginating user will \neventually goback \"onhook,\" abandoning thecall attempt iftheconnection is \nnotmade. Another form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination earth \nstation cannot process the call request. This woula bedue toequipment \nproblems with its local COorlack ofavailable COtrunks. Asshown in \nFigure 15,when thedestination earth station isblocking thecall, itsends a \ncircuit disconnect message totheMCS. Noindication ofblocking issent to \ntheoriginating user, however, and they will eventually goback \"onhook,\" \nabandoning thecall attempt. \nOnefinal form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination user isbusy. \nAsshown inFigure 16,thedestination ACTS COnotes that thedestination user \nisbusy andsends a\"busy tone\" back totheoriginating user indicating user \nblocking (primary reference event 4). The originating user goes back \"on \nhook,\" initiating anormal circuit disconnect sequence. \n4.3.4 ACTS LBRSystem Performance Experiment Configuration \nFigure 17shows theACTS LBRsystem configuration forsystem performance \nmeasurement experiments between asingle user pair. During the experiments \nboth users have 80286-class PCs running special experiment control and data \n661989010985-076\n\n()71989010985-077\n\nw\n68\n\n1989010985-079\n\n7(11989010985-080\n\ncollection programs. Theoriginating user's computer automatically calls the \ndestination user's computer, transfers apreset number ofpseudorandom \ndatafiles, and then disconnects the call. Both user/system interfaces are \nmonitored. Ateach step oftheaccess, transfer, anddisengagement functions, \ntherelevant interface events arerecorded and time stamped. Files ofthese \ntime stamped reference events along with copies ofthetransferred data files \nare stored inboth user's computers. Inthe data reduction step ofthe \nmeasurement process, estimates ofthe\"speed\" parameters aregenerated from the \ntime-stamped reference event files and estimates ofthe \"accuracy\" and \n\"reliability\" parameters aregenerated bycomparing thesource anddestination \ncopies ofthepseudorandom data files. \n5.CONCLUSION\nIthasbeen established that theANSI system performance standards canbe \nused tomeasure andcompare theperformance ofvastly different communication \nsystems, most notably communication satellite systems. Using this \"corn,non \nyardstick\" hasmar,y adv;_.tages: identifying what aparticular system does best\" \nhelping toidentify areas within asystem that can bechanged toimprove \nperformance, orpinpointing areas where costs canbereduced without serio_is \nimpact onsystem performance; determining which co,npeting system bes_ fits a \nuser's needs\" identifying the deficient vendor inmultivendor systen..\" and \nhaving the methods and tools toconduct repeatable system performance \nexperiments.\nByusing these system Derformance standards for quantifying existing \ncom,nunication satellite system performance, t:hcsatellite service providers can \nmarket their product against terrestrial long-haul systems torelatively \nuneducated users.

Intrying tomarket anyofthese diverse \nservices, demonstrating andspecifying thesystem performance interms ofthe \nstandards discussed here becomes critical. \n6.ACKNOWI _DCMFaNTS \nTheauthor thanks Thomas Cony andRonald Schertler ofNational Aeronautics \nandSpace Administration (NASA) fortheir explaaati_mq ahd information onthe \nACTS I.BRsystem.

Itconcludes with asample link budget cale_ _tion \n using link parameters for thehigh burstrate (HBR) reference station othe \nNASA Advanced Communications Technology SateJlite (ACTS) system. \n Link power budgets can beconstructed for any radio frequency (rf) \n_ transmission system. Like anybudget(financial ortransmission link), the \nassets (transmit power and anten_la gain) are summed and the liabilities \n(propagation losses, system losses, andthermal noise) aresubtracted giving a \nnetworth (C/No). Thegeneral rflink power budget_quation is(all quantities \nareindecibels [dB]) \nC/No =EIRP +G/TsLfs Lm_c+BO-k [1] \nwhere\nC/No isthecarrier-to-noise density ratio indBHz, \n!

Fehe \"(1983) and Pritchard and Sciulli (1986) give detailed \n!_ derivations ofthis equation along with many examples ofitsapplication. \ni Incommt .ation satellite link performance calculations, C/No isthe \n! result ofth_ ink power budget calculation and primary parameter used in \n!_ capacity calculations. Thenumerator, C,isthereceived carrier power. The \ni denominator, No, isthereceived nois_, power normalized toa1Hzbandwidth. \nf In]:_,kdesign calculations, C/No isaspecified requirement that the link \ni design must meet. Anequivalent e_pression isC/kT.,(kT_ -No), where kis \n Boltzmann's constant (I38x10.23J/K) and T,isthe equivalent noise \ni\n75I\ni Precedingpageblank t 198g(\")lr}.qR. _nRa\n\ntemperatureofthesystem, measuredinKelvin (K).Theconcept ofequivalent \nnoisetemperature iscovered indetail inPritchard and Sciulli (1986). \nAnother common expression isC/N, thecarrier-to-noise ratio, where Nisthe \ni total noisepowerinaspecified bandwidthB(N-BxNo). \nThenumericexpression forequivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) \nisthe transmitter output power (Pt)multiplied bythe transmit antenna \nmainbeam gain (G_) \nEIRP -PtxGt [2] \nVery often, when parabolic antennas are used, the antenna diametem and \noperating frequency aregiven inplace ofGt.From these, theantenna gain is \ncalculated by \nGt-y(_d/X) z [3] \nwhere\n-theantenna efficiency, typically 0.55, \nd-theantenna diameter inmeters, and \n-thewavelength. \nThereceive station figure ofmerit (G/Ts) istheratio ofthereceive \nantenna gain, G,tothesystem noise temperature,Ts.Thereceive antenna gain \niscalculated inthe same way asthe transmit antenna gain above. From \nJennings (1982),thesystemnoise temperatureiscalculated by \nTs-TA/_ +T2+TE [4] \nwhere\nTA-theantenna noisetemp_:ature, K, \n-theresistive losses (numeric) between theantenna andthe \nreceiver (usually theLNAwhich isthefirst component of \nthereceiver),\n761989010985-085\n\nT2-thecontribution tosystem noise temperature duetoresistive \nlosses,\n-(I -I/_)290K, and [5] \nTE_theequivalent noise temperature ofthereceiver, which \nincludes theLNA. \nThe receive station figure ofmerit, being awidely used parameter, is \navailable for themajority ofreceiver systems (earth station orsatellite) \nstudied. Ifitisnotstated inthesystemspecification, itcanbecalculated \nasshown inJennings (1982). \nThefree space loss, Lfs, isthepropagation loss dueto\"spreading loss\" \nofthetransmitted signal andwritten numerically as \nLfs-(4_R/A) 2 [6] \nwhere\nR=thedistance from theearth station tothesatellite inmeters. \n=thewavelength inmeters. \nOther losses inthe rflink are accounted for inLmscThese include \nwaveguide, polarization, pointing losses, and rain fade margin. Ifthese \nlosses are not specified, avalue of3to5dBfor C-band applications is \ntypically assumed. Forhigher fre%uency bands such aska,these losses become \nmore significant anddifficult topredict. Forexample, NASA allocates 17.8 dB \nforLms=, (8dBforrain loss), ontheHBRreference station down link during \nanticipated maximum rain fade conditions. \nI Much work hasbeen done inthedevelJpment ofstatistical rain attenuation models. Most efforts are based onthe probability ofpoint-rain-rates \nexceeding _certain percentage oftheyear foragiven rain climate region. A \ndetailed application ofthese models can befound inPritchard and Sciulli \n(1986) andFlock (1988). \nSatellite transponder back-L, ff,BO,isused toco_,,,l theintermodulation : \ndistortion (noise) generated inthe tran_[_onder output p-wer amplifier \n(traveling wave tube ampli[ier [TwTAi _rsolid-state power amplifier [SSPA]). \n77 • 1989010985-086\n\nIntermodulation distortion isgeuerated when theamplifier isoperated inthe \nnonlinea_ portion ofits transfer cu;ve (the amplifier issaturated). To \nleduce this distortion, thepower amplifier is\"backed off,\" i.e., operated \n_ bel.vsaturation. Amplifier manufacturers supply transfer characteristic \ncurxes from _hich therequired back-off forthesystem canbedetermined. \nIntermodu!ation distortion ismore prevalent inFM/FDM/FDMA systems with \nmultiple carriers andcontributes tothequantities known asAM-AM andAM-PM ] \nco_.0ersion and crosstalk. Jennings (1982) and Pritchard and Sciulli (1986) \ni di_,tss the impact ontheoverall system C/Noofintermodulation distortion \n__ cau.ed bymultiple carriers within asingle _ransponder and intermodulation \nii bet._een adjacent transponders However, when thetransponder issufficiently \n\"backed off,\" these effects are usually small and can beabsorbed inthe \nmiscellaneous losses entry. \nProblems with intermodulation distortion highlight the advantages of i \ndigital modulation andTDMA systems, _ith most digital modulation techniques, _ \nthe signal has aconstant envelope, thus reducing the AM-AM and AM-PM \nconversion and intermodulation products. With TDMA systems there isonly one \ncarrier present atatime, thus intermodulation distortion ise,,en further J\nreduced. This allows thetransponder tobeoperated closer tosaturation, thus \nincreasing the down link EIRP. However, there isstill the -_otential for j !\nintermodulation distortion duetoedjacent transponders. _i \nThere aretwoways toimplement back-off: Input back-off (BOi), where the i \nJpower flux density atthe satellite receive antenna isreduced, sndoutput \nback-off (BOo) ,where the satellite power amplifier gain isreduced. When il \nusing input back-off, thereceive power flux density required tooperate the \nsatellite transponder power amplifier atsaturation isdefined as_,the \nsaturated power flux density, andgiven (expressed asdBW/m 2)by \n-EIRPup L_sup -Lmscu p+4_/_2+BOi [7] \nThe maximum saturated power flux density istypically specified bythe \nsatelli_e carrier. Equation [7]isthen used tocalculate therequired uplink \nEIRP. When using output back-off attenuation isinserted inthetransponder to \nceduce thepower amplifier gain bythedesired output back-off BOO. \n781989010985-087\n\nq#'\nThecurrent generation ofcommunication satellites favors output back-off, i; \nThis allows ahigher EIRP ontheuplink andthus ahigher C/Noup. Satellite • \ncarriers such as!NTELSAT set limits onthe maximum allowable power flux i :t\ndensity to-84.0 dBW/m 2for multicarrier operation with global coverage \nantennas (Jennings, 1982). Thedisadvantage ofoutput back-off isthat it \nrequires extra satellite hardware and control links for adjusting the \ntransponder gain. \nOverall link performance isacombination ofuplink, down link, and _i \nintermodulation carrier-to-noise density ratios. Mathematically itis _ \nexpressed as \nif:\n?\nC/NoT-I =C/NOup i+C/Noan-1 +C/Noi-1 [8] !i \nwhere C/Noiisduetotheintermodulation products generated inthesatellite _: \ntransponder power amplifier. (Note: thisexpression usesthenumeric notthe \ndecibel, values ofthese quantities.) With the total link carrier-to-noise \ndensity ratio, system capacity canbecalculated. \nAnalog transmission _ystem capacity isbased ontherequired (specified \n according toapplication) baseband signal-to-noise ratio (Sb/Nb). For \n_ amplitude modulated (AM) systems, the baseband signal-to-noise ratio and \niiI received carrier-to-noise density ratio arerelated by \n_ SB/Nb=C/No xI/B, [9] \nii\n;where \ni\nB-themodulated signal bandwidth and 'i i\n-2xfm(twice thehighest baseband frequency, fm)\" \nFor frequency modulated (FM) systems, thebaseband signal-to-noise ratio and \nreceived carrier-to-noise density ratio (forsingle channel percarrier [SCPC] \nsystems) arerelated by \n Sb/Nb-3m2xi/2fmxC/No [i0] \n where \n; 79 \ni1989010985-088\n\nfm-thehighest 1\"nseband frequency, \nm-themodulation index and \n•Aflfm\naf-thepeak frequency deviation. \nAnapproximate FMbaseband bandwidth isfound from Carson's rule \nB-2fm(m +I)o [ii] \nFrom these bandwidths andmaximum frequencies, system channel capacity canbe \ncalculated. Pritchard andSciulli (1986) dothis forvarious channel multiplex \nhierarchies. They also expand these basic equations tocover multiple channel \npercarrier andtelevision applications, including preemphasis andpsophometric \nweighing factors typically specified FMmultiplex systems. \nSystem capacity calculations fordigital transmission systems aresomewhat \nsimplified. Thebasic unit ofmeasure isthebitenergy-to-noise density ratio \n(Eb/No). ForBPSK Eb/No isdirectly related toC/No by \nEb/No =C/No xTb [12] \nwhere\nTb=thetransmitted bitduration inseconds and \n=i/Rb (the inverse ofthetransmitted bitrate). \nFor power limited satellite communication systems, Figure A-I shows the \ntheoretical relationship between biterror probability andEb/No. Inpractical \nsystems this relationship also depends onthemodulation techniques anderror \ncorrection coding used, Feher (1983) andWhalen (1971) discuss atlength, the \nI:i relationships ofPe,Eb/No, modulation, andcoding. \nWith therequired Pe,andknowledge ofthemodulation techniques anderror \ncorrection coding used, the required Eb/No can befound from graphs like \nFigure A-I. From this, and thesatellite link C/No, thechannel transmitted \nbitrate canbefound by \n801989010985-089\n\nFigure #-i.Biterror ratevs.Eb/No. \n811989010985-090\n\nRb-(CINo)/(Eb/No). [13] \nTheuser's data rate isrelated tothetransmitted bitrate bythemodulation \ntechnique anderror correction coding used. InTDMA systems, theuser's data \nrate also depends onthelength oftheTDMA frame andnumber ofoverhead bits \ninthevarious control andsynchronization fields. Feher (1983) andPritchard \nandSciulli (1986) discuss TDMA frame structures, synchronization techniques, \nandsystem capacity calculations. \nUsing the_elationsh_p ofEb/No andPefrom Figure A-l, theadvantage of \nonboard digital signal regeneration iseasily shown. Forexample \nletEb/Noup =10.5 dB,and \nEblNOdn =10.5 dB, \nfrom Figure A-I, \nPeup =Pedn =ix10-6 \nForsystems with onboard digital regeneration thetotal probability oferror is \nthesumoftheerror probabilities foreach link.Therefore, \nPetota I_Peup +Pedn [14] \n=(IX10-6)+(iX10-6) \n=2xi0-8 \nForsystems without regeneration thetotal system Eb/No isfirst becalculated \n(using numeric values) \n- -I+(Eb/NO)dn-1 [15] i, (Eb/No)T I=(Eb/NO)u p \n(ll.22)up -I4-(11.22)dn -I \nTherefore, thetotal system Eb/No =5.61, yielding, \n(Eb/NO)T w7.5dB, \nfrom Figure A-I, \n821989010985-091\n\nThus, with onboard regeneration, asignificant improvement inerror performance \nisachieved. Another way tolook atthis is,foragiven Pe,therequired \ntransmit power canbereduced when using onboard digital signal regeneration. \nThefollowing example demonstrates link power budget calculations forthe \nNASA ACTS HBR system operating asaSS/TD;_Acommunication satellite.
