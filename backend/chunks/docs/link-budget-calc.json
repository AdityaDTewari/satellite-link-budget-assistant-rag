To calculate the height above ground, you need to \nsubtract the result from a line drawn directly between the tops of \nthe two towers. r = sqrt( λ*(d1*d2)/(d)) \n19\nLine of Sight and Fresnel Zones \nr = sqrt( λ*d1*d2/d) \nrMAX = 1/2* sqrt( λ*d)\nwhere all the dimensions are in meters \n20\nrMAX\nd1 d2r\nClearance of the Fresnel Zone and earth \ncurvature \nDistance \n(km) 1st zone \n(m) 60%\n (m) Earth curvature (m) Required height (m) \n1 5.5 3.3  0.0  3.9 \n5  12.4 7.44 0.4 7.84 \n10  17.5 10.5 1.5 12\n15  21.4 12.84 3.3 16.13 \n20  24.7 15.82 5.9 21.72 \n25  27.7 16.62 9.2 25.82 \n30  30.3 18.18 13.3 32.5 This table shows the minimum height above flat ground required to clear 60% of the \nfirst Fresnel zone for various link distances at 2.4 GHz. \nNotice that earth curvature plays a small role at short distances, but becomes more \nimportant as the distance increases. \n21\nFresnel Zone \n‣Considering the importance of the Fresnel Zone, it is \nimportant to quantify the degree to which it can be blocked. \n‣Typically, 20% - 40% Fresnel Zone blockage introduces little \nattenuation into the link. \n‣It is better to err to the conservative side allowing no more \nthan 20% blockage of the Fresnel Zone. \n22\nFor more details about the topics presented in this \nlecture, please see the book Wireless \nNetworking in the Developing World , available \nas free download in many languages at: \nhttp://wndw.net/ \nThank you for your attention \n"}
