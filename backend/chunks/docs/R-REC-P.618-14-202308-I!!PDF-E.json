These effe cts include:  \na) absorption in atmospheric gases; absorption, scattering and depolarization by hydrometeors \n(water and ice droplets in precipitation, clouds, etc.); and emission noise from absorbing \nmedia; all of which are especially important at frequencies above about  10 GHz;  \nb) loss of signal due to beam -divergence of the earth -station antenna, due to the normal \nrefraction in the atmosphere;  \nc) a decrease in effective antenna gain, due to phase decorrelation across the antenna aperture, \ncaused by irregularities in the refractive -index structure;  \nd) relatively slow fading due to beam -bending caused by large -scale changes in refractive index; \nmore rapid fading (scintillation) and variations in angle of arrival, due to small -scale \nvariations in refractive index;  \ne) possible limitations in bandwidth due to multiple scattering or multipath effects, especially \nin high -capacity digital systems;  \nf) attenuation by the local environment of the ground terminal (buildings, trees, etc.);  \ng) short -term variations of the ratio of attenuations at the up - and down -link frequencies, which \nmay affect the accuracy of adaptive fade countermeasures;  \nh) for non -geostationary satellite (non -GSO) systems, the effect of varying elevation angle to \nthe satellite.  \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 3 \n Ionospheric effects (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) may be important, particularly at frequencies \nbelow 1 GHz. For convenience these have been quantified for frequencies of 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 3 and \n10 GHz in Table 1 for a high value of total electron content (TEC). The effects include:  \nj) Faraday rotation: a linearly polarized wave propagating through the ionosphere undergoes a \nprogressive rotation of the plane of polarization;  \nk) dispersion, which results in a differential time delay across the bandwidth of the transmitted \nsignal;  \nl) excess time delay;  \nm) ionospheric scintillation: inhomogeneities of electron density in the ionosphere cause \nrefractive focusing or defocusing of radio waves and lead to amplitude fluctuations termed \nscintillations. Ionospheric scintillation is maximum near the geomagnetic e quator and \nsmallest in the mid -latitude regions. The auroral zones are also regions of large scintillation. \nStrong scintillation is Rayleigh distributed in amplitude; weaker scintillation is nearly \nlog-normal. These fluctuations decrease with increasing fr equency and depend upon path \ngeometry, location, season, solar activity and local time. Table 2 tabulates fade depth data \nfor VHF and UHF in mid -latitudes, based on data in Recommendation  ITU-R P.531.  \n Accompanying the amplitude fluctuation is also a phase fluctuation. The spectral density of \nthe phase fluctuation is proportional to 1/ f 3, where f is the Fourier frequency of the \nfluctuation. This spectral characteristic is similar to  that arising from flicker of frequency in \noscillators and can cause significant degradation to the performance of receiver hardware.  \n \n \n4 Rec.

ITU-R  P.618 -14 5 \n TABLE 2  \nDistribution of mid -latitude fade depths due to ionospheric scintillation (dB)  \n \nThis Annex deals only with the effects of the troposphere on the wanted signal in relation to system \nplanning. Interference aspects are treated in separate Recommendations:  \n– interference between earth stations and terrestrial stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.452);  \n– interference from and to space stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.619);  \n– bidirectional coordination of earth stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.1412).  \nAn apparent exception is path depolarization which, although of concern only from the standpoint of \ninterference (e.g.  between orthogonally -polarized signal transmissions), is directly related to the \npropagation impairments of the co -polarized direct signa l. \nThe information is arranged according to the link parameters to be considered in actual system \nplanning, rather than according to the physical phenomena causing the different effects. As far as \npossible, simple prediction methods covering practical applica tions are provided, along with \nindications of their range of validity. These relatively simple methods yield satisfactory results in \nmost practical applications, despite the large variability (from year to year and from location to \nlocation) of propagation  conditions.  \nAs far as possible, the prediction methods in this Annex have been tested against measured data from \nthe data banks of Radiocommunication Study Group 3 (see Recommendation  ITU-R P.311).  \n2 Propagation loss  \nThe propagation loss on an Earth -space path, relative to the free -space loss, is the sum of different \ncontributions as follows:  \n– attenuation by atmospheric gases;  \n– attenuation by rain, other precipitation and clouds;  \n– focusing and defocusing;  \n– decrease in antenna gain due to wave -front incoherence;  \n– scintillation and multipath effects;  \n– attenuation by sand and dust storms.  \nEach of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of frequency, geographic location \nand elevation angle. As a rule, at elevation angles above 10°, only gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud \nattenuation and possibly scintillation will be s ignificant, depending on propagation conditions. \nFor non-GSO systems, the variation in elevation angle should be included in the calculations, \nas described in §  8.

ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \n(In certain climatic zones, snow and ice accumulations on the surfaces of antenna reflectors and feeds \ncan produce prolonged periods with severe attenuation, which might dominate even the annual \ncumulative distribution of attenuation.)  \n2.1 Attenuation due to atmospheric gases  \nAttenuation by atmospheric gases which is entirely caused by absorption depends mainly on \nfrequency, elevation angle, altitude above sea level and water vapour density (absolute humidity). \nAt frequencies below 10 GHz, it may normally be neglected. Its impo rtance increases with frequency \nabove 10 GHz, especially for low elevation angles. Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU -R P.676 gives \na complete method for calculating gaseous attenuation, while Annex 2 of the same Recommendation \ngives an approximate method for f requencies up to 350  GHz.  \nAt a given frequency the oxygen contribution to atmospheric absorption is relatively constant. \nHowever, both water vapour density and its vertical profile are quite variable. Typically, the \nmaximum gaseous attenuation occurs during the season of maximum ra infall (see Recommendation \nITU-R P.836).  \n2.2 Attenuation by precipitation and clouds  \n2.2.1  Prediction of attenuation statistics for an average year  \nThe general method to predict attenuation due to precipitation and clouds along a slant propagation \npath is presented in § 2.2.1.1. The method to predict the probability of non -zero rain attenuation along \na slant path is described in § 2.2.1.2.  \nIf reliable long -term statistical attenuation data are available that were measured at an elevation angle \nand a frequency (or frequencies) different from those for which a prediction is needed, it is often \npreferable to scale these data to the elevation an gle and frequency in question rather than using the \ngeneral method. The recommended frequency -scaling method is found in § 2.2.1.3.  \nSite diversity effects may be estimated with the method of § 2.2.4.  \n2.2.1.1  Calculation of long -term rain attenuation statistics from point rainfall rate  \nThe following procedure provides estimates of the long -term statistics of the slant -path rain \nattenuation at a given location for frequencies up to 55  GHz. The following parameters are required:  \n R0.01  : point rainfall rate for the location for 0.01% of an average year (mm/h)  \n hs : height above mean sea level of the earth station (km)  \n  : elevation angle (degrees)  \n  : latitude of the earth station (degrees)  \n f : frequency (GHz)  \n Re : effective radius of the Earth (8  500 km).  \nIf local data for the earth station height above mean sea level is not available, an estimate can be \nobtained from the maps of topographic altitude given in Recommendation ITU -R P.1511.  \nThe geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1.  \n Rec.

If this long -term statistic cannot be obtained from local data sources, an estimate can \nbe obtained from the maps of rainfall rate given in Recommendation  ITU-R P.837.

ITU-R  P.618 -14 9 \n 2.2.1.2  Probability of rain attenuation on a slant path  \nThe following procedure computes P (A > 0) (%) , the probability of non -zero rain attenuation on a \ngiven slant path.

Typically, the frequency of the \npredicted propagation effect is higher than the frequency of the known propagation effect.  The ratio \nbetween the rain attenuation at the two frequencies can vary during a rain event, and the variability \nof the ratio generally increases as the rain attenuation increases.  \n \n1 𝑐𝐵is the same bivariate normal integral used in § 2.2.4.1. An approximation to this integral is available in \nZ. Drezner and G.O. Wesolowsky. “On the Computation of the Bivariate Normal Integral ”, Journal of \nStatistical Computation and Simulation. Vol. 35, 1989, pp. 101 -107. \n The Matlab statistics toolbox contains the built -in Matlab function ‘ mvncdf ’ that computes the bivariate \nnormal integral, and the Python library contains the built -in function ‘mvndst’ that computes the bivariate \nnormal integral.  \n10 Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \nTwo prediction methods are provided in the following paragraphs:  \n1) Section  2.2.1.3.1 provides a method of predicting the statistical variation of the rain \nattenuation at frequency f2 conditioned on the rain attenuation at frequency f1. This  method \nrequires the cumulative distributions of rain attenuation at both frequencies.  \n2) Section  2.2.1.3.2 provides a simplified method of predicting the equiprobable rain \nattenuation at frequency f2 conditioned on the rain attenuation at frequency f1. This  method \ndoes not require the cumulative distribution of the rain attenuation at either frequency.  \nThese prediction methods may be applicable to uplink power control and adaptive coding and \nmodulation, for example:  \na) The first method predicts the instantaneous uplink rain attenuation at frequency f2 based on \nthe measured instantaneous downlink rain attenuation at frequency f1 for a p% risk the actual \nuplink rain attenuation will exceed the predicted value.  \nb) The second method predicts the uplink rain attenuation at frequency f2 based on knowledge \nof the downlink rain attenuation at frequency f1 at the same probability of exceedance.  \n2.2.1.3.1  Conditional distribution of the frequency scaling ratio of rain attenuation  \nThis prediction method is based on the following relation between A2 (dB), the instantaneous rain \nattenuation at frequency f2, and A1 (dB), the instantaneous rain attenuation at frequency f1. \n  \n() n A A  +\n\n\n− − + − = ξσξ1σμσμ lnξ1σσ) ln(22\n112\n2 12\n12\n2  (15) \nwhere n is a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance.

These rain attenuation statistics can be computed from the local \nmeasured rain attenuation (i.e. excess attenuation in addition to gaseous attenuation, \ncloud  attenuation, and scintillation fading) data or from the rain attenu ation prediction method \nin § 2.2.1.1 for the specific location and path elevation angle of interest. The rain attenuation statistics \nat frequencies f1 and f2 should be derived from the same source.  \nThe procedure has been tested at frequencies between 19 and 50 GHz, but is recommended for \nfrequencies up to 55  GHz.  \nThe following parameters are required:  \n f1: lower frequency at which the rain attenuation is known (GHz)  \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 11 \n  f2: higher frequency at which the rain attenuation is predicted (GHz)  \n Prain: probability of rain (%)  \n 1: mean of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f1 \n 2: mean of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f2 \n 1: standard deviation of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f1 \n 2: standard deviation of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f2. \nFor each frequency, f1 and f2, perform a log -normal fit to the rain attenuation vs. probability of \noccurrence as follows:  \nStep 1:  Calculate Prain (%), the time percentage of rain on the path.

However, the accuracy of this procedure has not been \nestablished.  \n2.2.1.3.2  Long -term frequency scaling of rain attenuation statistics  \nIf reliable attenuation data measured at one frequency are available, the following empirical formula \ngiving an attenuation ratio directly as a function of frequency and attenuation may be applied for \nfrequency scaling on the same path in the frequency range 7 to 55  GHz:  \n  \n( )),,( 1\n1 21 2121 /A HA A − =  (24) \nwhere:  \n  \n()242\n101 fff−+=   (25) \n  \n55.0\n115.0\n1 23–\n121 ) ()/( 1012.1),,( A A H    =   (26) \nA1 and A2 are the equiprobable values of the excess rain attenuation at frequencies f1 and f2 (GHz), \nrespectively.  \nFrequency scaling of attenuation from reliable long-term measured attenuation data, rather than \nlong-term measured rain data, is preferred.  \n2.2.2  Seasonal variations  – worst month  \nSystem planning often requires the attenuation value exceeded for a time percentage, pw, of the worst \nmonth. The following procedure is used to estimate the attenuation exceeded for a specified \npercentage of the worst month.  \nStep 1 :  Obtain the annual time percentage, p, corresponding to the desired worst -month time \npercentage, pw, by using the equation specified in Recommendation  ITU-R P.841 and by applying \nany adjustments to p as prescribed therein.  \nStep 2 :  For the path in question obtain the attenuation, A (dB), exceeded for the resulting annual time \npercentage, p, from the method of §  2.2.1.1, or from measured or frequency -scaled attenuation \nstatistics. This value of A is the estimated attenuation for pw per cent of the worst month.  \nCurves giving the variation of worst -month values from their mean are provided in Recommendation \nITU-R P.678.  \n2.2.3  Variability in space and time of statistics  \nPrecipitation attenuation distributions measured on the same path at the same frequency and \npolarization may show marked year -to-year variations. In the range 0.001% to 0.1% of the year, the \nattenuation values at a fixed probability level are observed to v ary by more than 20%  r.m.s. When the \nmodels for attenuation prediction or scaling in §  2.2.1 are used to scale observations at a location to \nestimate for another path at the same location, the variations increase to more than 25%  r.m.s.  \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 13 \n 2.2.4  Site diversity  \nIntense rain cells that cause large attenuation values on an Earth -space link often have horizontal \ndimensions of no more than a few kilometres. Diversity systems able to re -route traffic to alternate \nearth stations, or with access to a satellite with extr a on-board resources available for temporary \nallocation, can improve the system reliability considerably. Site diversity systems are classified as \nbalanced if the attenuation thresholds on the two links are equal, and unbalanced if the attenuation \nthreshol ds on the two links are not equal. At frequencies above 20 GHz, path impairments other than \nrain can also affect site diversity performance.  \nThere are two site diversity predictions models:  \n– the prediction method described in §  2.2.4.1 that is applicable to unbalanced and balanced \nsystems and computes the joint probability of exceeding attenuation thresholds; and  \n– the prediction method described in §  2.2.4.2 that is applicable to balanced systems with short \ndistances and computes the diversity gain.  \nThe prediction method described in §  2.2.4.1 is the most accurate and is preferred. The simplified \nprediction method described in §  2.2.4.2 may be used for separation distances less than 20 km; \nhowever, it is less accurate.  \n2.2.4.1  Prediction of outage probability due to rain attenuation with site diversity  \nThe diversity prediction method assumes a log -normal distribution of rain intensity and rain \nattenuation.  \nThis method predicts Pr (A1  a1, A2  a2), the joint probability (%) that the attenuation on the path to \nthe first site is greater than a1 and the attenuation on the path to the second site is greater than a2. \nPr (A1  a1, A2  a2) is the product of two joint probabilities:  \n1) Pr, the joint probability that it is raining at both sites; and  \n2) Pa, the conditional joint probability that the attenuations exceed a1 and a2, respectively, given \nthat it is raining at both sites; i.e.:  \n \n  Pr (A1  a1, A2  a2) = 100  Pr  Pa% (27) \nThese probabilities are:  \n  \n()1222\n2 212\n1\n2dd\n122exp\n121\n12rrrrr rP\nRR rr\nrr \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−+ −−\n−=  (28) \nwhere:  \n  \n( ) ( )] 700/ exp[3.0 60/ exp7.02d dr − + − =  (29) \nand \n  \n()12\nln ln22\n2 212\n1\n2d\n122exp\n121\n1ln1ln 1\n2ln2ln 2b dbb bb bP\nAA\nAA ma ma aa\naa  \n−\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n−+ −−\n−=  (30) \nwhere:  \n  \n( ) ( )  2500/ exp06.0 30/ exp94.0 d da − + − =  (31) \n14 Rec.

This alternate method can be used for site separations of less than 20 km. \nParameters required for the calculation of diversity gain are:  \n d : separation (km) between the two sites  \n A : path rain attenuation (dB) for a single site  \n f : frequency (GHz)  \n  : path elevation angle (degrees)  \n  : angle (degrees) made by the azimuth of the propagation path with respect to the \nbaseline between sites, chosen such that   90°. \nStep 1 : Calculate the gain contributed by the spatial separation from:  \n  \n) (e–1–bdda G=  (37) \nwhere:  \n a = 0.78 A – 1.94 (1 – e–0.11 A) \n b = 0.59 (1 – e–0.1 A) \nStep 2 : Calculate the frequency -dependent gain from:  \n  Gf = e–0.025 f (38) \nStep 3 : Calculate the gain term dependent on elevation angle from:  \n  G = 1 + 0.006  (39) \nStep 4 : Calculate the baseline -dependent term from the expression:  \n  G = 1 + 0.002  (40) \nStep 5 : Compute the net diversity gain as the product:  \n16 Rec.

Median durations are of the order of several minutes. No significant dependence of these \ndistributions on fade depth is evident in most measur ements for fades of less than 20  dB, implying \nthat the larger total time percentage of fades observed at lower fade levels or at higher frequencies is \ncomposed of a larger number of individual fades having more or less the same distribution of \ndurations. S ignificant departures from log -normal seem to occur for fade durations of less than about \nhalf a minute. Fade durations at a specified fade level tend to increase with decreasing elevation angle.  \nFor the planning of integrated services digital network (ISDN) connections via satellite, data are \nneeded on the contribution of attenuation events shorter than 10  s to the total fading time. This \ninformation is especially relevant for the attenuation leve l corresponding to the outage threshold, \nwhere events longer than 10  s contribute to system unavailable time, while shorter events affect \nsystem performance during available time (see Recommendation ITU -R S.579). Existing data \nindicate that in the majority  of cases, the exceedance time during available time is 2% to 10% of the net \nexceedance time. However, at low elevation angles where the short period signal fluctuations due to \ntropospheric scintillation become statistically significant, there are some cas es for which the exceedance \ntime during available time is far larger than in the case at higher elevation Earth -space paths.  \n2.2.5.2  Rates of change of attenuation (fading rate)  \nThere is broad agreement that the distributions of positive and negative fade rates are log -normally \ndistributed and very similar to each other. The dependence of fade rate on fade depth has not been \nestablished.  \n2.2.5.3  Correlation of instantaneous values of attenuation at different frequencies  \nData on the instantaneous ratio of rain attenuation values at different frequencies are of interest for a \nvariety of adaptive fade techniques. The frequency -scaling ratio has been found to be log -normally \ndistributed, and is influenced by rain type and rai n temperature. Data reveal that the short -term \nvariations in the attenuation ratio can be significant, and are expected to increase with decreasing path \nelevation angle.  \n2.3 Clear -air effects  \nOther than atmospheric absorption, clear -air effects in the absence of precipitation are unlikely to \nproduce serious fading in space telecommunication systems operating at frequencies below about \n10 GHz and at elevation angles above 10°. At low elevation a ngles (  10°) and at frequencies above \nabout 10  GHz, however, tropospheric scintillations can on occasion cause serious degradations in \nperformance. At very low elevation angles (  4° on inland paths, and  5° on overwater or coastal paths), \nfading due to multipath propagation effects can be particularly severe. At some locations, ionospheric \nscintillation may be important at frequencies below about 6  GHz (see  Recommendation  ITU-R P.531).  \n2.3.1  Decrease in antenna gain due to wave -front incoherence  \nIncoherence of the wave -front of a wave incident on a receiving antenna is caused by small -scale \nirregularities in the refractive index structure of the atmosphere. Apart from the rapid signal \nfluctuations discussed in §  2.4, they cause an antenna -to-medium coupling loss that can be described \nas a decrease of the antenna gain.  \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 17 \n This effect increases both with increasing frequency and decreasing elevation angle, and is a function \nof antenna diameter. Although not explicitly accounted for in the refraction models presented below, \nthis effect is negligible in comparison.  \n2.3.2  Beam spreading loss  \nThe prediction method for Earth -to-space and space -to-Earth beam spreading loss is given in \nRecommendation ITU -R P.834.  \n2.4 Scintillation and multipath fading  \nThe amplitude of tropospheric scintillations depends on the magnitude and structure of the refractive \nindex variations along the propagation path. Amplitude scintillations increase with frequency and \nwith the path length, and decrease as the antenna beamwi dth decreases due to aperture averaging. \nMeasured data shows the monthly -averaged r.m.s. fluctuations are well -correlated with the wet term \nof the radio refractivity, Nwet, which depends on the water vapour content of the atmosphere.  \nThere are three parts of the method of predicting the fading due to amplitude scintillation:  \n1) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading at free -space elevation angles  5° (§  2.4.1).  \n2) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading for fades  25 dB (§ 2.4.2).  \n3) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation in the transition region between the above \ntwo distributions (§ 2.4.3).  \nAs noted in Recommendation ITU -R P.834, a radio wave between a station on the surface of the \nEarth and a space station is bent towards the Earth due to the effect of atmospheric refraction. \nAs a result, the apparent elevation angle, which considers atmosph eric refraction, is greater than the \nfree-space elevation angle, which only considers the line -of-sight between the two stations. If the \nfree-space elevation angle of interest is greater than or equal to 5°, the difference between the apparent \nand free -space elevation angles is insignificant, and only the prediction method described in § 2.4.1 \nneeds to be considered.  \nAn illustrative example of the three parts of the prediction method is shown in Fig. 2. Note that the \nprediction method in the transition region described in § 2.4.3 is tangent to the distribution described \nin § 2.4.1 at a free -space elevation angle of 5° and tangent to the distribution described in § 2.4.2 at a \nscintillation fading depth of 25 dB.  \n18 Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \nFIGURE 2  \nIllustrative example of three parts of the scintillation prediction method  \n \nAt very small percentages of time, and similarly for large fade depths (greater than about 10 dB), the \nfading due to scintillation at very low elevation angles can be significant. The fading is also observed \nto have a character similar to multipath fading on terrestrial links. Similar to the distribution of fade \ndepths on terrestrial links, the distribution of fade depths for very low angle satellite links also appears \ncorrelated with refractivity gradient statistics. The overall fading distribution shows a  gradual \ntransition from a scintillation distribution at large exceedance percentages to a multipath fading \ndistribution (with a slope of 10  dB/decade) at small percentages. The prediction methods in §§ 2.4.2 \nand 2.4.3 for the deep fading and shallow fadin g portions of the overall distribution, respectively, use \nthe refractivity gradient statistic, pL, to describe the climatic variations in the distribution.  \nThe net fade distribution due to tropospheric refractive effects, A( p), is the combination of beam \nspreading, scintillation, and multipath -fading effects described above. Tropospheric and ionospheric \nscintillation distributions may be combined by summing the respective time percentages that \nspecified fade levels are exceede d. \n2.4.1  Calculation of monthly and long -term statistics of amplitude scintillations at  elevation \nangles greater than 5 degrees  \nA general method for predicting the cumulative probability distribution of tropospheric scintillation \nat elevation angles greater than or equal to 5 degrees is given below. The prediction method is based \non monthly or longer averages of temperature and rel ative humidity, and reflects the specific climatic \nconditions at the Earth -station of interest. Since average surface temperature and average surface \nrelative humidity vary with season, the scintillation fade depth distribution varies with season. The \nseasonal variation may be predicted by using seasonal average surface temperature and seasonal \naverage surface relative humidity, which may be obtained from weather information for the site of \ninterest.  \n\n Rec.

ITU-R  P.618 -14 23 \n 2.5 Estimation of total attenuation due to multiple sources of simultaneously occurring \natmospheric attenuation  \nFor systems operating at frequencies above about 18 GHz, and especially those operating with low \nelevation angles and/or margins, the effect of multiple sources of simultaneously occurring \natmospheric attenuation must be considered.  \nTotal attenuation (dB) represents the combined effect of rain, gas, clouds and scintillation and \nrequires one or more of the following input parameters:  \n AR ( p) : attenuation due to rain for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Ap in equation  (8) \n AC  ( p) : attenuation due to clouds for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by \nRecommendation ITU -R P.840  \n AG ( p) : gaseous attenuation due to water vapour and oxygen for a fixed probability (dB), as \nestimated by Recommendation  ITU-R P.676  \n AS ( p) : attenuation due to tropospheric scintillation for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated \nby equation ( 49) \nwhere p is the probability the attenuation is exceeded (i.e. the CCDF) in the range from 50% to \n0.001%.  \nGaseous attenuation as a function of percentage of time can be calculated using § 2.2 of Annex 2 of \nRecommendation ITU -R P.676 if local meteorological data at the required time percentage are \navailable. In the absence of local data at the required time per centage, the mean gaseous attenuation \nshould be calculated and used in equations ( 65) and ( 66). \nThe total attenuation, 𝐴𝑇(𝑝) (dB), for a fixed probability, is given by:  \n 𝐴𝑇(𝑝)={𝐴𝐺(𝑝)+√(𝐴𝑅(𝑝)+𝐴𝐶(𝑝))2+𝐴𝑆2(𝑝)  ,0.001% ≤ 𝑝≤ 5%                     (65)\n𝐴𝐺(𝑝) + √𝐴𝐶2(𝑝) + 𝐴𝑆2(𝑝),5% < 𝑝 ≤ 50%                          (66) \nwhere:  \n  AC ( p) = AC (5%)  (dB)  for p < 5.0%  (67) \n  AG ( p) = AG (5%)  (dB)  for p < 5.0%  (68) \nWhen the total attenuation prediction method was tested versus measured total attenuation statistics \nusing either concurrent measured rain rate or the worldwide rain rate maps in Recommendation \nITU-R P.837, the r.m.s. relative error averaged over the probability range from 0.001% to  5% was \nabout 33%. Due to the dominance of different effects at different probabilities as well as the \ninconsistent availability of test data at different probability levels, some variation of r.m.s. error \noccurs across the distribution of probabilities.  \n2.6 Attenuation by sand and dust storms  \nVery little is known about the effects of sand and dust storms on radio signals on slant -paths. \nAvailable data indicate that at frequencies below 30  GHz, high particle concentrations and/or high \nmoisture contents are required to produce significant propaga tion effects.  \n3 Noise temperature  \nAs attenuation increases, so does emission noise. For earth stations with low -noise front -ends, this \nincrease of noise temperature may have a greater impact on the resulting signal -to-noise ratio than \nthe attenuation itself.  \n24 Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \nThe sky noise temperature at a ground station antenna may be estimated by:  \n  Tsky = Tmr (1 – 10–A/10) + 2.7 × 10–A/10         K (69) \nwhere:  \n Tsky : sky noise temperature (K) at the ground station antenna  \n A : total atmospheric attenuation excluding scintillation fading (dB)  \n Tmr : atmospheric mean radiating temperature (K).  \nWhen the surface temperature Ts (K) is known, the mean radiating temperature, Tmr, may be estimated \nfor clear and cloudy weather as:  \n  Tmr = 37.34 + 0.81  × T S      K (70) \nIn the absence of local data, an atmospheric mean radiating temperature, Tmr, of 275 K may be used \nfor clear and rainy weather.  \nThe noise environments of stations on the surface of the Earth and in space are treated in detail in \nRecommendation  ITU-R P.372.  \nFor satellite telecommunication systems using the geostationary orbit, earth stations will find that the \nSun and, to a lesser extent, the Moon, are significant noise sources at all frequencies, and the galactic \nbackground is a possibly significant consider ation at frequencies below about 2 GHz \n(see Recommendation ITU -R P.372). In addition, Cygnus A and X, Cassiopeia A, Taurus and the \nCrab nebula may contribute to the sky background noise temperature.  \nRefer to Recommendation ITU -R P.372 to determine the earth station system noise temperature from \nthe brightness temperatures discussed above.  \n4 Cross -polarization effects  \nFrequency reuse by means of orthogonal polarizations is often used to increase the capacity of space \ntelecommunication systems. This technique is restricted, however, by depolarization on atmospheric \npropagation paths. Various depolarization mechanisms, es pecially hydrometeor effects, are important \nin the troposphere.  \nFaraday rotation of the plane of polarization by the ionosphere is discussed in Recommendation \nITU-R P.531. As much as 1° of rotation may be encountered at 10 GHz, and greater rotations at lower \nfrequencies. As seen from the earth station, the planes of po larization rotate in the same direction on \nthe up - and down -links. It is therefore not possible to compensate for Faraday rotation by rotating the \nfeed system of the antenna, if the same antenna is used both for transmitting and receiving.  \n4.1 Calculation of long -term statistics of hydrometeor -induced cross -polarization  \nTo calculate long -term statistics of depolarization from rain attenuation statistics the following \nparameters are needed:  \n Ap : rain attenuation (dB) exceeded for the required percentage of time, p, for the path \nin question, commonly called co -polar attenuation (CPA)  \n  : tilt angle of the linearly polarized electric field vector with respect to the \nhorizontal (for circular polarization use  = 45°)  \n f : frequency (GHz)  \n  : path elevation angle (degrees).  \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 25 \n The method described below to calculate cross -polarization discrimination (XPD) statistics from rain \nattenuation statistics for the same path is valid for 6   f  55 GHz and   60°. The procedure for \nscaling to frequencies down to 4  GHz is given in §  4.3 (and see Step  8 below).  \nStep 1 : Calculate the frequency -dependent term:  \n  \n\n − + −\n=\nGHz55 36 311 log935GHz36 9 14 log26GHz9 6 328 log60\nf . f .f . ff . f\nCf  (71) \nStep 2 : Calculate the rain attenuation dependent term:  \n  CA = V ( f ) log Ap (72) \nwhere:  \n  \n()\n\n\n\n\n=−\nGHz55 40 0.13GHz40 20 6.22GHz20 9 8.12GHz9 6 8.30\n15.019.021.0\nf fff ff f\nfV  \nStep 3 : Calculate the polarization improvement factor:  \n  C = –10 log [1  – 0.484 (1  + cos 4 )] (73) \nThe improvement factor C = 0 for  = 45° and reaches a maximum value of 15  dB for  = 0° or  90°. \nStep 4 : Calculate the elevation angle -dependent term:  \n  C = –40 log (cos )                for   60° (74) \nStep 5 : Calculate the canting angle dependent term:  \n  C = 0.0053 2 (75) \n is the effective standard deviation of the raindrop canting angle distribution, expressed in degrees; \n takes the value 0°, 5°, 10° and 15° for 1%, 0.1%, 0.01% and 0.001% of the time, respectively.  \nStep 6 : Calculate rain XPD not exceeded for p% of the time:  \n  XPD rain = Cf  – CA + C + C + C              dB (76) \nStep 7 : Calculate the ice crystal dependent term:  \n  Cice = XPD rain  (0.3 + 0.1 log p)/2              dB (77) \nStep 8 : Calculate the XPD not exceeded for p% of the time, including the effects of ice:  \n  XPD p = XPD rain – Cice              dB (78) \n26 Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \nIn this prediction method in the frequency band 4 to 6 GHz where path attenuation is low, Ap statistics \nare not very useful for predicting XPD statistics. For frequencies below 6 GHz, the  frequency -scaling \nformula of §  4.3 can be used to scale cross -polarization statistics calculated for 6  GHz to a lower \nfrequency between 4 and 6  GHz.  \n4.2 Joint statistics of XPD and attenuation  \nThe conditional probability distribution of XPD for a given value of attenuation, Ap, can be modelled \nby assuming that the cross -polar to co -polar voltage ratio, r = 10–XPD /20, is normally distributed. \nParameters of the distribution are the mean value, rm, which is very close to 10–XPDrain/20, with XPD rain \ngiven by equation ( 76), and the standard deviation, r, which assumes the almost -constant value of \n0.038 for 3  dB  Ap  8 dB. \n4.3 Long -term  frequency  and  polarization  scaling  of statistics  of hydrometeor -induced  \ncross -polarization  \nLong -term XPD statistics obtained at one frequency and polarization tilt angle can be scaled to \nanother frequency and polarization tilt angle using the semi -empirical formula:  \n \n   \n\n\n\n\n + +\n= GHz30 , 4for  \n)4cos1(484.0–1)4cos1(484.0–1log20–21\n1 12 2\n1 2 ff\nff\nXPD XPD  (79) \nwhere XPD 1 and XPD 2 are the XPD values not exceeded for the same percentage of time at \nfrequencies f1 and f2 and polarization tilt angles, 1 and 2, respectively.  \nEquation ( 79) is based on the same theoretical formulation as the prediction method of §  4.1, and  can \nbe used to scale  XPD data that include the effects of both rain and ice depolarization, since it has been \nobserved that both phenomena have approximately the same frequency dependence at frequencies \nless than about 30  GHz.  \n4.4 Data relevant to cross -polarization cancellation  \nExperiments have shown that a strong correlation exists between rain depolarization at 6 and 4 GHz \non Earth -space paths, both on the long term and on an event basis, and uplink depolarization \ncompensation utilizing concurrent down -link depolarization measu rements appears feasible. Only \ndifferential phase effects were apparent, even for severe rain events, and single -parameter \ncompensation (i.e. for differential phase) appears sufficient at 6 and 4 GHz.  \nMeasurements at 6 and 4 GHz have also shown that 99% of the XPD variations are slower than \n 4 dB/s, or equivalently, less than  1.5°/s in the mean path differential phase shift. Therefore, the \ntime constant of a depolarization compensation system at these frequencies need only be about 1  s. \n5 Propagation delays  \nRadiometeorologically -based methods for estimating the average propagation delay or range error, \nand the corresponding variations, for Earth -space paths through the troposphere are available in \nRecommendation ITU -R P.834. The delay variance is required for  satellite ranging and \nsynchronization in digital satellite communication systems. At frequencies above 10  GHz, the \nionospheric time delay (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) is generally smaller than that for the \ntroposphere, but may have to be considered in  special cases.  \nRange determination to centimetre accuracy requires careful consideration of the various \ncontributions to excess range delay. The water vapour component amounts to 10 cm for a zenith path \nand a reference atmosphere with surface water vapour concentration o f 7.5 g/m3 and 2 km scale height \n Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14 27 \n (see Recommendation ITU -R P.676). This contribution is the largest source of uncertainty, even \nthough the dry atmosphere adds 2.3 m of the zenithal excess range delay.  \nFor current satellite telecommunication applications, additional propagation delays contributed by \nprecipitation are sufficiently small to be ignored.  \n6 Bandwidth limitations  \nIn the vicinity of the absorption lines of atmospheric gases, anomalous dispersion produces small \nchanges in the refractive index. However, these refractive index changes are small in the bands \nallocated to Earth -space communications, and will not restrict  the bandwidth of systems.  \nMultiple scattering in rain can limit the bandwidth of incoherent transmission systems due to variation \nin time delays of the multiple -scattered signals; however, the attenuation itself under such \ncircumstances will present a far more serious problem. A st udy of the problem of bandwidth \nlimitations imposed by the frequency dependence of attenuation and phase shift due to rain on \ncoherent transmission systems showed that such bandwidth limitations are in excess of 3.5  GHz for \nall situations likely to be enco untered. These are greater than any bandwidth allocated for Earth -space \ncommunications below 40  GHz, and the rain attenuation will therefore be far more important than its \nfrequency dependence.  \n7 Angle of arrival  \nElevation -angle errors due to refraction are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. The total \nangular refraction (the increase in apparent elevation) is about 0.65°, 0.35° and 0.25°, for elevation \nangles of 1°, 3° and 5°, respectively, for a tropical mar itime atmosphere. For a polar continental \nclimate the corresponding values are 0.44°, 0.25° and 0.17°. Other climates will have values between \nthese two extremes. The day -to-day variation in apparent elevation is of the order of 0.1°  (r.m.s.) at \n1° elevati on, but the variation decreases rapidly with increasing elevation angle.  \nShort -term angle -of-arrival fluctuations are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. Short -term \nvariations, due to changes in the refractivity -height variation, may be of the order of 0.02° (r.m.s.) at  1° \nelevation, again decreasing rapidly with increasing elevation  angle. In practice, it is difficult to \ndistinguish between the effect of the short -term changes in the refractivity -height distribution and the \neffect of random irregularities superimposed on that distribution. A statistical analysis of the short -term \nangle-of-arrival fluctuation at 19.5 GHz and at an elevation angle of 48° suggests that both in elevation \nand azimuth directions, standard deviations of angle -of-arrival fluctuations are about 0.002° at the \ncumulative time percentage of 1%. The seasonal varia tion of angle -of-arrival fluctuations suggests that \nthe fluctuations increase in summer and decrease in winter. The diurnal variation suggests that they \nincrease in the daytime and decrease both in the early morning and the evening.  \n8 Calculation of long -term statistics for non -GSO paths  \nThe prediction methods described above were derived for applications where the elevation angle \nremains constant. For non -GSO systems, where the elevation angle is varying, the link availability \nfor a single satellite can be calculated in the following way:  \na) calculate the minimum and maximum elevation angles at which the system will be expected \nto operate;  \nb) divide the operational range of angles into small increments (e.g. 5 degrees wide);  \nc) calculate the percentage of time that the satellite is visible as a function of elevation angle in \neach increment;  \n28 Rec.  ITU-R  P.618 -14  \n  \nd) for a given propagation impairment level, find the time percentage that the level is exceeded \nfor each elevation angle increment;  \ne) for each elevation angle increment, multiply the results of c) and d) and divide by 100, giving \nthe time percentage that the impairment level is exceeded at this elevation angle;  \nf) sum the time percentage values obtained in e) to arrive at the total system time percentage \nthat the impairment level is exceeded.  \nIn the case of multi -visibility satellite constellations employing satellite path diversity (i.e.  switching \nto the least impaired path), an approximate calculation can be made assuming that the spacecraft with \nthe highest elevation angle is being used.  \n "}
