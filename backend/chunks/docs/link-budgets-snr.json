Generally,\nthere is a threshold below the performance of the communication system is unacceptable. In\ndigital communication systems, the bit error rate of the system often becomes unacceptably high\n(according to the promised performance by a communication system) below a certain SNR. We\nhave employed link budgets to predict the received power in a communication system. A natural\nevolution to a link budget to adapt it to determine the received SNR.\nIn this course we have focused on narrowband radio systems where a sinusoidal signal is assumed.\nIn practise, the sinusoid acts as a carrier for the information signal, which is the true \\signal\".\nHence, strictly speaking, the SNR refers to this power of the recovered signal power to noise\npower. We will use the term carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) to refer to the received carrier power.\nHere, we will use the symbol cto refer to the received carrier power and nto the noise power.\nFriis' formula can be written as\nC=EIRP\u0012\u0015\n4\u0019r\u00132Gr\nl\nwherelis other losses over and above the free-space loss, and EIRP has been de\fned previously\nas the product of the transmit power and transmit gain (e\u000bective radiated isotropic power). It\ncould be polarization loss factor, impedance mismatch loss, di\u000braction loss, plane-earth re\rection\nloss, etc. including a combination of these e\u000bects.\nThe carrier-to-noise power ratio is found by setting N=kTSB:\nC\nN=EIRP\u0012\u0015\n4\u0019r\u00132Gr\nlkTSB\nIt is common to represent the CNR over 1 Hz of signal bandwidth ( B= 1 Hz), so that the\nresulting expression can simply divided by the bandwidth to get the ratio:\nC\nN0=EIRP\u0012\u0015\n4\u0019r\u001321\nlkGr\nTS\nIn dB, this expression becomes\n\u0014C\nN0\u0015\ndB=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr\nTS\u0015\ndB+ 228:6 ( units: dB-Hz )\nwhere 10 log(1=k) = 228:6dBW/K-Hz. Note that receive antenna's gain and the receiver tem-\nperature are grouped together as a ratio that is often called the receiver \fgure of merit . This\nProf. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems\nLink Budgets Page 2\nper-Hz form of the CNR is useful since the CNR can be found for any signal bandwidth by simply\nsubtracting 10 logB:\n\u0014C\nN\u0015\ndB=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr\nTS\u0015\ndB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B) ( units: dB )\nHence, a link budget is obtained by \\accounting\" for each of these terms in a budget in dB units,\nwhere losses are \\negative\" and gains are \\positive\". Usually, Lmust be expanded into a larger\nsummation of terms to account for each of the loss e\u000bects that we have studied in detail in this\ncourse.\nLink Margin\nAs discussed in class, some additional margin is usually provided for in the implementation of the\nsystem so that it can deal with worst-case fading caused by the atmosphere and other e\u000bects.\nThe margin is usually introduced by increasing a combination of the transmit power, transmit\nantenna gain, and receive antenna gain. Often, it is the margin that is of most interest in the\nbudget, since it tells you how much room is built into the link budget. If the minimum required\nCNRCNR reqis known, the margin is simply the di\u000berence in dB between the actual CNR and\nthe required CNR:\nM=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr\nTS\u0015\ndB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B)\u0000\u0014C\nN\u0015\nreq;dB\nA nice example link budget for a satellite system is taken from page 229 of Sklar, B., \\Digital\nCommunications: Fundamentals and Applications\", Prentice-Hall, 1998, and is shown in Table 1.\nIt is an uplink budget (from the earth terminal to the satellite) at 8 GHz, covering a distance of\n40,721 km. The bandwidth of the satellite signal is 2 MHz.\nNote that the losses Lappear multiple times in the table, alluding to the fact that all these terms\nmust be summed to yield the total losses in the system. These losses total 13.5 dB and include:\n\u000fFade allowance (6) refers to extra margin added to compensate for fading introduced by\natmospheric and/or rain attenuation.\n\u000fOther losses (7) could include polarization loss, and propagation-related losses not modelled\nby free-space loss calculations.\n\u000fEdge of coverage loss (10) refers to the losses seen user at the edge of the coverage\npattern, where the gain of the antenna (pattern) is lower and the signal also has a larger\nrange to cover. Choosing the edge of the coverage pattern makes the budget conservative\nby assuming a worse-cast scenario.\n\u000fImplementation loss (17) refers to implementation losses in the receiver (e.g. detector e\u000e-\nciency)\nProf. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems\nLink Budgets Page 3\nDescription Symbol Value Notes\n1.

Link margin M 8.0 dB\nTable 1: Example Link Budget showing Receive Antenna Gain\nTransmitter loss is treated separately since it a\u000bects the EIRP directly.\nThe system temperature was obtained known that the antenna temperature was 300 K, the\nreceiver equivalent temperature was 3806 K, and the noise \fgure of the receiver was 11.5 dB.\nHence, the system temperature is 4106 K or 36.1 dB-K.\nIn Table 1, the budgeting is similar to have we have handled link budgets in the past: receive\nantenna gain is accounted for directly and the signal-to-noise ratio calculated directly by computing\nthe noise power kT. Hence, to calculate the received Wr=N0ratio, you simply divide the received\nisotropic power by kTor subtract 192:5dBW/Hz in the budget.\nYou can also compute the link budget using the receiver \fgure of merit as de\fned earlier. Ob-\nviously, using either technique you should get the same result. The link budget employing the\nreceiver \fgure of merit is shown in Table 2.\nIn equation form, the link margin is calculated as follows:\nM=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr\nTS\u0015\ndB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B)\u0000\u0014C\nN0\u0015\nreq;dB\n= 69:6dBW\u0000202:7dB\u000013:5dB+ (\u00001:0dB) + 228:6dBW/K-Hz\n\u000010 log(2 MHz)\u000010:0dB\n= 8:0dB\nProf. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems\nLink Budgets Page 4\nDescription Symbol Value Notes\n1.

The analysis\nof the resulting CNR in a multi-hop link is similar to the analysis of cascaded networks when we\nstudied noise \fgure earlier in the course. Consider a two hope radio link as shown in the notes.\nC1is the carrier power at the output of the \frst link. It is ampli\fed by an ampli\fer, then undergoes\ngains/losses associated with a standard radio link to the next hop. The cumulative gain between\nthe links is de\fned as \u000b, so that the output signal power is C2=\u000bC 1.\nThe noise power at the output of the link is not simply \u000bN 1since the second link may introduce\nnoise as well (either externally or internally generated by components on that link). Hence,\nN=\u000bN 1+N2;\nProf. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems\nLink Budgets Page 5\nwhich is similar to the noise power at the output of a network with gain \u000b: the input noise is\nscaled by\u000b, and the network adds a noise of its own at the output. The resulting ratio of the\noverall noise to the \fnal received carrier power is\nNT\nC2=N2\nC2+\u000bN 1\nC2=N2\nC2+\u000bN 1\n\u000bC 1=N2\nC2+N1\nC1:\nThe CNR of the link is\nC\nN=\"\u0012C1\nN1\u0013\u00001\n+\u0012C2\nN2\u0013\u00001#\u00001\n:\nThis is the result for M= 2 link segments.
