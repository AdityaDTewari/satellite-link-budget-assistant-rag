The ﬁrsttool, the Visual Communication Payload design software, allows designers to graphicallydesign their payload by using a simple drag and drop action with payload componentsonto an area within the program. Information about each picked component is pulledfrom a database of common space-qualiﬁed communication components sold by commericalcompanies. Once a design is completed, various reports can be generated , such as theMaster Equipment List. The second tool, RF Link Budget Calculator software, is a link\nbudget calculator designed speciﬁcally for ease of use. Other features of this tool include\nbeing able to access a database of NASA ground based apertures for near Earth andDeep Space communication, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) baseapertures, and information about the solar system relevant to link budget calculations. Thelink budget tool allows for over 50 diﬀerent combinations of user inputs, eliminating theneed for multiple spreadsheets and the errors associated with wrong inputs. Both of theaforementioned tools increase the productivity of space communication systems designers,and have the colloquial latitude to allow non-communication experts to design preliminarycommunication payloads.\nNomenclature\nCLI Command-Line Interface\ndB Decibel: logarithmic measure of a ratio\ndBW Decibel relative to 1 Watt\nDSN Deep Space Network\nDSS Deep Space Station\nGUI Graphical User Interface\nIDE Integrated Development Environment\nNASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nRF Radio frequency\nTDRSS Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System\nI. Introduction\nSpace communications system design can be tedious and complicated when using unoptimized design\ntools. This is certainly the case with previous link budget calculator tools, which rely on complicatedand contrived spreadsheet operations. In such operations, information is easily lost and/or miscalculatedbecause of the lack of scalability of the spreadsheet formulas. This, in turn, makes communication payload\n∗This work was completed over a summer internship at NASA GRC, SCaN, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Student AIAA member.\n†Senior Physicist, Aerospace Communications Systems Branch, 21000 Brookpark Rd.\n1o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\ndesign hard to learn for a newcomer to the ﬁeld. After a link budget is determined for a NASA mission,\nphysical communication payload components must be picked to create and close this link. This step ofthe process involves looking up each company’s product and comparing the product’s characteristics withthe requirements, which takes a lot of time. Creating a more intuitive user interface for calculating thelink budget and picking payload components can reduce any possible error with calculations, obtaining\ncomponent information, and increase eﬃciency for experienced communications engineers.\nI.A. Background\nIn the past, other link budget tools have been created to aid the user in calculating a link budget. They\nhave evolved from CLI programs, to formulae across spreadsheets, to primitive GUI programs. For example,an older optical link budget calculator tool created by Emily Kukura previously used command line queriesa ss h o w ni nF i g u r e1 .\nFigure 1. Command Line Link Budget Program\nEven more, a satellite communications toolbox has been created by Mathworks to also help calculate\nbasic characteristics for a satellite link. It allows a user to use predeﬁned functional blocks to create graphsfor carrier to noise power. However, using this toolbox involves substantial monetary purchase of MATLABsoftware and time to become acquainted with the MATLAB software and programming language.\nA link budget is a ﬁrst step for communications payload designers and potential users to determine\nif a wireless transmitter and receiver can “close” a link, meaning if a wireless signal has enough powerat the receiving end such that its information is retained and readable.\n5The link budget is a way for\ndesigners and users to obtain a prelimary understanding of the dynamics which will be involved in draftingthe communications systems of a mission.\nNaively, one could say a link budget equation appears:\nReceived Power =Transmitted Power +Gains+Received Area −Losses (1)\nEq. (1) is a simplistic way of showing the idea behind calculating a link budget. Received and Transmitted\nPower is measured in dBW, while Gains, Received Area, and Losses are measured in dB.\nThis equation becomes far more complex when one considers how to calculate each term. For example,\nhow one determines the gain of DSS 27 based on its inclination, frequency, and surrounding wind froma cursory reading of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook easily demonstrates this.\n3So,\nthe diﬃculty/complexity in these calculations is the primary motivation for the creation of a user-friendlyprogram which aides in link budget calculation.\nOnce the link budget is ﬁnalized, a rough sketch of the generic components needed for the payload is\nmade to obtain an estimate of the power and mass to meet the requirements of the NASA mission. Figure 2shows a generic communication payload for a single fault relay communication system. The switches switchin redundant components if the primary one fails. The diplexers in Figure 2 allows the same antenna totransmit on one frequency band and receive on a diﬀerent one. The use of up and down converters allow acommunication relay to receive and transmit signals between two diﬀerent communication sources.\n2o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nFigure 2. Schematic of K u-S/K aBand Space-Based Relay Communication Payload\nAfter determining the general components needed, the more tedious part of the process begins as the\ncomponents either need to be custom-made or bought from a commerical company. Space-qualiﬁed compo-nents can be limited in variety as they can be made for speciﬁc missions, while others can be more genericas waveguides and switches. Looking up those components online, calling the companies for more detailedspeciﬁcations, and browsing through physical catalogs takes time. Integrating all the information into oneplace would be more eﬃcient, and a database is perfect for this. However, once all of these components are\npicked, the important characteristics of each component are recorded usually into an Excel document to getan estimate of the mass, power, and cost requirements for the mission. These steps are used each time acommunication payload is designed, and going through them takes time. However, if all of the information\nis saved and easily accessible, the amount of time for this part of the design process can be greatly reduced.\nII. Design Philosophy\nThe idea behind the two tools was to create interfaces which were user friendly for experts and newcomers\ntocommunicationpayloaddesign. Togetabetterideaoftheprogram’sappearance, VisualStudiowaschosento aid in creating and designing these tools. Visual Studio is an IDE for Visual Basic which allows the userto design the appearance of the program in situ. With it, common objects such as buttons, radio buttons,\ntextboxes, and combo boxes can easily be moved, resized, and programmed for events. Visual Basic was\nchosen as the language to program in as it is relatively easy to learn, and versatile when compiled acrossMicrosoft products (as NASA most commonly utilizes).\nTo choose the kind of databases to use for the RF Link Budget Calculator and Visual Communication\nPayload design tool, the portability of each program had to be considered. Excel spreadsheets were used inthe link budget tool to store the ground antenna information since it was much easier to update and movethe database from any computer. The MySQL database was used for the communication payload designsoftware, because it is open-source and can be installed on any computer. The database of all commercialpayload components contains pictures of each component, leading to a larger sized database, so an Excelspreadsheet database is not the best implementation for this program. Microsoft Access was also a strongconsideration as a database since NASA uses Microsoft products, but the open-source MySQL was chosensince it could store images. This program could be implemented with an Access database for wider usewithin NASA, but MySQL allows any person to be able to use this program easily.\nThe programs were designed to be modular - so that future developers would be able to remove and/or\ninsert modules and classes as needed.\n2This is more practical for the payload design tool because in the\nfuture new components will be designed for problems that have not yet been realized. The modularityof the program will allow these components to be easily added. The link budget calculator can also bereprogrammed to allow for greater precision in its various calculations, without rewriting major portions ofits codebase.\n3o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nIII. Design Implementation\nStepping through the process, for the Communication Payload Design Tool, there were several interfaces\nthat needed to be created: main interface, inputting component details, and generating the report form.The main interface is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Main interface of Communication Payload Design Tool\nThe left panel allows the user to create the components onto the white design area on the right. Generic\ncomponents can be picked on the communication payload design tool and arranged in the certain conﬁgura-tion. As each component is added to the design area, the user can pick from a list of commercially available\ncomponents from a database that the database automatically retrieves as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. List is pulled from a database\nThe database stores all relevant information for each component such as mass, power, operating tem-\nperature range, and dimensions as seen in the middle panel in Figure 3. When someone right clicks ontothe component, it gives the user options to delete, edit, or view the component’s information, also shown inFigure 4.\nThe database skeleton was set up and populated with a few example components as shown in Figure 5:\n4o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nFigure 5. Sample Component for Parabolic Antennas\nAn overview of the features of the Communication Payload Design Tool is located in Appendix A.\nLikewise, for the Link Budget Calculator Tool, several interfaces were needed: a main interface, a system\nnoise interface, a solar system body distance selection interface, and a antenna database interface.\nThe main interface is shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Main interface of link budget calculator\nThe four colored boxes each denote a general domain of discussion for what will be entered/returned.\nThe leftmost is for transmitting information, the next for range information, then for receiving information,and ﬁnally for data information. In each box there are some ﬁelds which are open for input, and some\nblocked to prevent error (depending upon which options are chosen for a particular calculation). Prior to\nrunning a calculation, each enabled input is checked to be sure it is numeric and in the correct range.\nTo allow the user the option of calculating system noise temperature directly, an interface for calculating\nthe system noise temperature was added as seen in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. System noise temperature calculator interface\n5o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nOne can see the various diﬀerent parameters which can be taken into account when calculating system\nnoise temperature. The program allows the user to calculate the system noise temperature three ways: en-tering the system noise temperature directly, entering the receiver noise temperature along with backgroundsand antenna temperatures, or by entering the backgrounds and antenna temperatures above and the lownoise ampliﬁer gain and noise temperature, and the losses after the LNA.\nThe solar system body distance calculator is shown in Figure 8.\nFigure 8. Solar system body distance calculator interface\nThis interface allows a user to select either a close, medium, or far approach from a solar body and obtain\na range without leaving the program, as the data is preprogrammed in.\nFinally, the antenna database interface for DSN sites is shown in Figure 9. It allows the user to select\nthe site, the frequency band used, the antenna, the elevation angle, and the cumulative distribution.\nFigure 9. Antenna database interface\nThe antenna database interface greatly simpliﬁes the process of obtaining data on a particular antenna\nsuch as what power, frequency, and gain the antenna is able to transmit/receive. Usually, one must leafthrough a telecommunications design handbook to obtain this information, but the program was designedto automatically integrate all of the antenna data from the Excel database into this interface.\n6o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nIV. Results\nAfter using the link budget calculator tool to calculate a link, the results of each parameter that goes\ninto calculating the link can be saved as an Excel or pdf ﬁle. A sample of the pdf output is shown in Figure10.\nFigure 10. A portion of the results given by the link budget calculator’s pdf output\nThe same goes with the Visual Communication Payload Design Tool:\nFigure 11. Project Description of Design Report\nThe Visual Communication Payload program will generate a report that always consists of the project\ndescription cover page as shown in Figure 11.\n7o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nFigure 12. MEL/PEL Equipment List of Design Report\nIn addition, the second page of the report contains a table of the relevant characteristics for each payload\ncomponent for a mission, which is often the mass and power equipment list as shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 13. Component Description of Design Report\nThen, the rest of the report will contain detailed descriptions of each component such as in Figure 13.\nEach page is one component, and within each page, a picture is in the top right corner while the relevantcharacteristics are in the top left table. Then the rest of the compoents characteristics are in the main table.\nV. Conclusions\nThe creation of these two tools will have shortened the pre-design process for a NASA by performing\nall the functions needed for a designer as well as making it easy to use for the designer. The link budgetcalculator tool calculates scenarios with diﬀerent parameters such as the link between Earth and weather-observing satellites or transmitting images from rovers on the Jupiter moon, Io, back to Earth. Then thecalculator saves these diﬀerent scenarios in a way so they are easier to compare while integrating relevant\n8o f9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\ninformation into the program. Having all the information in one program allows the link budget analysis to\ngomoresmoothlyinsteadofhavingtolookuptheradiusofagroundstationantennaordistancebetweentwoplanets. The communication payload tool will shorten the the process of designing the payload by integratingall the information of commercial components in one place, instead of looking up each and every componentthrough separate catalogs. Also, it allows the user to create a visual representation of their design with an\nintuitive main interface. These two tools are or will be used for NASA missions in communication payload\ndesign, and these tools in the future can be expanded on to include more features such as connecting the linkbudget calculator tool together with the communication payload design software to see what componentsare available to meet the requirements of the speciﬁc mission.\nAppendix\nAppendix A\nBy: Christine Soong\nObjective: Support rapid payload design for user by having \nall relevant information of components in one central location\nOption for user to \ndelete, edit, and view \ncomponent details\nGeneral Features:\n/g120Developed through VB.Net on Visual Studio 2012\n/g120Connects to MySQL database of component information\n/g120Graphical User Interface:\n/g190Create as many components as needed\n/g190Arrange components to user’s configuration\n/g190Resize drawing area & individual components\n/g190Contains premade configuration of basic payload \ndesigns\n/g120Output:\n/g190Export details of all components onto Excel & \nText File\n/g190Exports screenshot of current configuration\n/g190Can save current configuration & reopen laterCommercial Component Option:\n/g120Allows user to select from a list of \ncommercial parts stored in MySQL \ndatabase\n/g120Once a component is selected, program \nwill retrieve all details of the \ncomponent from the database & \nautomatically fill it in\nUser-Defined Component Option:\nAllows user to define their own \ncomponent and fill in the characteristics associated with it\nMySQL Database:\n/g120Contains tables of components & their details: antennas, diplexers, \ngimbals, receiver, transmitters, transceivers, up/down converters\n/g120Can enter component information anytime & program will \nautomatically retrieve the list\n/g120Can associate an image for a specific componentVisual Communication Payload\nDesign Software\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like thank Dr. Kul B.
