ITU-R  P.676 -13 3 \n3 that, for values of surface temperature, surface pressure and surface water vapour density or \nintegrated water vapour content statistics known from long -term historical data or from the maps in \nRecommendation ITU -R P.2145 , the approximate method in Annex  2 should be used to estimate \nstatistics of the slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range \nfrom 1 to 350 GHz;  \n4 that, in the application of Recommendation ITU -R P.1853 , the method in Annex 2 should be \nused to estimate the Weibull approximation to the slant path water vapour attenuation.  \n \n \nAnnex 1  \n \nLine -by-line calculation of gaseous attenuation  \n1 Specific attenuation  \nThe specific attenuation at frequencies up to 1  000 GHz, due to dry air and water vapour, can be \naccurately evaluated at any value of pressure, temperature and humidity as a summation of the \nindividual spectral lines from oxygen and water vapour, together with small additional factors for the \nnon-resonant Debye spectrum of oxygen below 10  GHz, pressure -induced nitrogen attenuation above \n100 GHz and a wet continuum to account for the excess wat er vapour -absorption found \nexperimentally. Figure  1 shows the specific attenuation using the prediction method, calculated from \n0 to 1 000 GHz at 1  GHz intervals, for a pressure of 1  013.25  hPa, temperature of 15  C for the cases \nof a water vapour density of 7.5  g/m3 (Standard) and a dry atmosphere (Dry).  \nNear 60  GHz, many oxygen absorption lines merge together at sea -level pressures to form a single, \nbroad absorption band, which is shown in more detail in Fig.  2. This Figure also shows the oxygen \nattenuation at higher altitudes, with the individual lines becoming resolved as the pressure decreases \nwith increasing altitude. Some additional molecular species (e.g. oxygen isotopic species, oxygen \nvibrationally excited species, oz one, ozone isotopic species and ozone vibrationally excited species, \nand other min or species) are not included in the line -by-line prediction method. These additional lines \nare insignificant for typical atmospheres but may be important for a dry atmosphere.  \nThe specific gaseous attenuation is given by:  \n  \n( ) dB/km)( )( )( 1820.0 f \"Nf \"NfVapour Water Oxygen w o + =+=  (1) \nwhere o and w are the specific attenuations (dB/km) due to dry air (oxygen, pressure -induced \nnitrogen and non -resonant Debye attenuation) and water vapour, respectively,  f is the \nfrequency  (GHz), and N Oxygen ( f ) and N Water Vapour ( f ) are the imaginary parts of the frequency -\ndependent complex refractivities:  \n \n  𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′′(𝑓)=∑ 𝑆𝑖𝐹𝑖+𝑁𝐷′′(𝑓) 𝑖 (𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛 )  (2a) \n  𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′′(𝑓)=∑ 𝑆𝑖𝐹𝑖 𝑖 (𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟 )  (2b) \nSi is the strength of the ith oxygen or water vapour line, Fi is the oxygen or water vapour line shape \nfactor, and the summations extend over all the spectral lines in Tables 1 and 2 ; \n)(f\"ND\n is the dry continuum due to pressure -induced nitrogen absorption and the Debye spectrum \nas given by equation (8). \n4 Rec.

ITU-R  P.676 -13 11 \n2.2.1  Non-negative apparent elevation angles  \nThe slant path gaseous attenuation on an ascending path between heights ℎ1 and ℎ2  \n(ℎ2>ℎ1≥0 km) is:  \n  𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑠=∫γ(ℎ)\nsinφ(ℎ)𝑑ℎℎ2\nℎ1=∫γ(ℎ)\n√1−cos2φ(ℎ)𝑑ℎℎ2\nℎ1 (11) \nwhere:  \n  cosφ(ℎ)=(𝑅𝐸+ℎ1) 𝑛(ℎ1)\n(𝑅𝐸+ℎ) 𝑛(ℎ)cosφ1 (12) \nγ(ℎ) is the specific attenuation at height  ℎ, 𝑅𝐸 is the average Earth radius (6 371 km), φ1 is the local \napparent elevation angle at height ℎ1, and 𝑛(ℎ) is the refractive index at height ℎ.  \nWhile equation (11) can be evaluated by numerical integration2, the slant path gaseous attenuation is \nwell-approximated by dividing the atmosphere into exponentially increasing layers, determining the \nspecific attenuation (dB/km) of each layer and the path length (km) through each layer, and summing \nthe product of th e specific attenuation of each layer and the path length through each layer as shown \nin equation (13). In the absence of local temperature, dry air pressure, and water vapour partial \npressure profiles vs. height (e.g. from radiosonde data), any of the six reference standard atmospheres \n(i.e. the mean annual global reference atmosphere, the low -latitude reference atmosphere, the mid -\nlatitude summer reference atmosphere, the mid -latitude winter reference atmosphere, the high -\nlatitude summer reference atmosphe re, or the high -latitude winter reference atmosphere) given in \nRecommendation ITU -R P.835  may be used.  \n  𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑠=∑ 𝑎𝑖 𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥\n𝑖=1  (dB) (13) \nwhere i is the specific attenuation (dB/km) of the ith layer per equation  (1), and 𝑎𝑖 is the path length \n(km) through the ith layer.  \nFor a slant path between the surface of the Earth and space and referring to the geometry in Fig. 5, \nthe thickness of the layers increases exponentially from 10  cm at the surface of the Earth to ~1 km at \na height of ~100 km to ensure an accurate estimate o f the total slant path gaseous attenuation.

ITU-R  P.676 -13 13 \nAlternatively, β𝑖 can be calculated directly without calculating α𝑖 using Snell’s law in polar \ncoordinates as follows:  \n  β𝑖=sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1\n𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖sinβ1) (19b)  \nand similarly, α𝑖 can be calculated as follows:  \n  α𝑖=sin−1(𝑛1𝑟1\n𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1) (19c)  \nIn the Earth -to-space direction, equations (19a) or (19b) and (19c) may be invalid at initial apparent \nelevation angles < 1° (i.e. initial apparent zenith angle, β1,>89𝑜) when the radio refractivity gradient \n𝑑𝑁/𝑑ℎ is less than −157  N-units/km, which may occur when radiosonde data from certain regions of \nthe world susceptible to ducting are used as the atmospheric profile. In these cases, the radio wave is \nreflected by the atmosphere and follows the curvature of the  Earth (i.e. travels in ducts) , and the \nargument of the inverse sine function in equations (19a) or (19b) and (19c) is greater than 1. Equations \n(19a), (19b), and (19c) are valid for all non -negative apparent elevation angles when any of the \nsix reference standard atmospheres in Recommendation ITU -R P.835  are used as input, since these \nreference atmospheres do not have refractivity gradients characteristic of ducting.  \nFigure 4 shows the zenith attenuation calculated at 1  GHz intervals for the mean annual global \nreference standard atmosphere in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 . The “Standard” atmosphere is the \nmean annual global reference atmosphere with ρ𝑜 = 7.5 g/m3, and the “Dry” atmosphere is the mean \nannual global reference atmosphere with ρ𝑜 = 0 g/m3. \n2.2.2  Negative apparent elevation angles  \nEquation (13) assumes the height increases between the earth station and space. However, for \nnegative apparent elevation angles from an elevated earth station, the height decreases along the \npropagation path between the earth station and the minimum grazin g height and then increases along \nthe propagation path between the minimum grazing height and space. This is shown in Fig. 3 for an \nearth station at height ℎ1 with an apparent elevation angle of 90o−β1. \nFrom Snell’s law in polar coordinates:  \n  𝑛(ℎ𝐺)(𝑅𝐸+ℎ𝐺)=𝑛(ℎ1) (𝑅𝐸+ℎ1)sinβ1 (20) \nin which case the grazing height, ℎ𝐺, can be determined by iteratively solving equation (20). The \nrefractive index, 𝑛(ℎ), can be determined from equations (1) and (2) of Recommendation \nITU-R P.453  for the specific atmospheric profile of interest, typically one of the reference profiles in \nRecommendation ITU -R P.835 . \nThe net gaseous attenuation is the sum of the gaseous attenuations for Path 1 and Path 2. Path 1 is the \ngaseous attenuation between a virtual earth station at height ℎ𝐺 km and the actual earth station at a \nheight of ℎ1 km at an apparent elevation angle of 0  degrees , and Path 2 is the gaseous attenuation \nbetween a virtual earth station at height ℎ𝐺 km and the maximum atmospheric height (typically \n100 km) at an apparent elevation angle of 0  degrees . \n14 Rec.  ITU-R  P.676 -13 \nFIGURE 3  \nGrazing height geometry  \n \n2.2.3  Space -Earth Earth -space reciprocity  \nFor a path between a space station and an earth station, where the apparent elevation angle, φ𝑠, at the \nspace station is negative, and the apparent elevation angle at the earth station is φ𝑒, the apparent \nelevation angles are related by:  \n  φ𝑠=−cos−1(𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑒\n𝑟𝑠 𝑛𝑠cosφ𝑒) (21a)  \nand \n  φ𝑒=cos−1(𝑟𝑠 𝑛𝑠\n𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑒cosφ𝑠) (21b)  \nwhere 𝑛𝑒 is the refractive index at the earth station height, 𝑟𝑒 is the radius from the centre of the Earth \nto the earth station ( 𝑟𝑒≥𝑅𝐸), 𝑛𝑠 is the refractive index at the space station height, and  𝑟𝑠 is the radius \nfrom the centre of the Earth to the space station ( 𝑟𝑠>𝑟𝑒). If the height of the space station is greater \nthan 100 km above the surface of the Earth, then 𝑛𝑠 = 1. \nSince propagation through the atmosphere is reciprocal, the gaseous attenuation for a space -Earth \npath, where the apparent elevation angle at the space station is φ𝑠, is identical to the gaseous \nattenuation for the reciprocal Earth -space path, where the apparent elevation angle at the earth station \nis φ𝑒. As a result, the gaseous attenuation for a descending space -Earth path can be calculated as the \ngaseous attenuation for the corresponding ascending Earth -space path. If 𝑟𝑠 𝑛𝑠\n𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑒cosφ𝑠>1, then the \nspace -Earth path does not intercept the Earth.  \n2.2.4  Atmospheric bending  \nThe total atmospheric bending, 𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 , along the Earth -space path is:  \n  𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 =∑ (β𝑖+1−αi)𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 −1 \n𝑖=1 (22a)  \n  =∑ [sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1\n𝑛𝑖+1 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1)−sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1\n𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1) ]𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 −1 \n𝑖=1 (22b)  \nwhere a positive value of bending means the ray bends toward the Earth.

This effect is \ndescribed in terms of phase dispersion vs. frequency (deg/km) or group delay vs. frequency (ps/km), \nand, similar to attenuation, dispersion can be calculated for slant paths.  \nSimilar to equation (1), the specific gaseous phase dispersion, φ, is given by:  \n  φ=φ𝑜+φ𝑤=−1.2008 𝑓(𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′(𝑓)+𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′(𝑓))        (deg/km)  (24) \nwhere φ𝑜 is the specific phase dispersion (deg/km) due to dry air, φ𝑤 is the specific phase dispersion \ndue to water vapour; 𝑓 is the frequency (GHz); and 𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′(𝑓) and 𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′(𝑓) are the real \nparts of the frequency -dependent complex refractivities:  \n \n                 𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′(𝑓)=∑ 𝑆𝑖𝐹𝑖′+𝑁𝐷′(𝑓) 𝑖 (𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛 )  (25a) \n  𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′(𝑓)=∑ 𝑆𝑖𝐹𝑖′\n𝑖 (𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟 )  (25b) \nwhere:  \nSi is the strength of the ith oxygen or water vapour line from equation (3), 𝐹𝑖′ is the real part of the \noxygen or water vapour line shape factor:  \n  𝐹𝑖′=𝑓\n𝑓𝑖[(𝑓𝑖−𝑓)+δΔ𝑓\n(𝑓𝑖−𝑓)2+Δ𝑓2−(𝑓𝑖+𝑓)+δΔ𝑓\n(𝑓𝑖+𝑓)2+Δ𝑓2] (25c)  \nand the summations extend over all spectral lines in Tables 1 and 2 . \n\n Rec.

Noise power spectral density, 𝑆(𝑓), and noise \ntemperature, 𝑇(𝑓), are related by 𝑆(𝑓)=𝑘 𝑇(𝑓), where 𝑘 is Boltzmann’s constant. The downwelling \nspace -to-Earth microwave brightness temperature looking up and the upwelling Earth -to-space \nmicrowave brightness temperature looking down can be calculated similar to equation (13). Layer 1 \nis typically at the surface of the Earth, and laye r k is at the top of the atmosphere (typically 100 km). \nThe aggregate microwave brightness temperature is the sum of the microwave brightness \ntemperatures of each atmospheric layer multiplied by the loss between t hat atmospheric layer and the \nobservation point. It is assumed that the atmosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium and \nscattering is negligible.  \nIn the following paragraphs, 𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗) is the microwave brightness temperature of the jth layer \ndefined by:  \n  𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗)=0.048  𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧[1\nexp (0.048 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧\n𝑇𝑗)−1]  (K) (26) \n\n18 Rec.

𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗) can be well -approximated by 𝑇𝑗 for \n𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧 <0.42 𝑇𝑗; j is the specific attenuation (dB/km) of the jth layer given in equation (1), and 𝑎𝑗 is \nthe path length (km) through the jth layer given in equation (17).  \nThe difference between the physical temperature, 𝑇, and the microwave brightness temperature of a \nblackbody source, 𝑇𝐵, is shown in Fig. 7.
