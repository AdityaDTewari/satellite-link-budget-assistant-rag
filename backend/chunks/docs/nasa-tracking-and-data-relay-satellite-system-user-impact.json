INTRODUCTION\nThis report presents the results of the Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellite System (TDRSS) User Impact and Network Compatibility Study\nconducted by Hughes Aircraft Company, Space and Communications Group\nfor the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard Space\nFlight Center, under Contract NAS 5-20357. This study was to identify\nand examine antennas for the user spacecraft which satisfy TT & C\ndata rates and have minimum impact on the user. The intended scope of\nthe study also originally included considerations of compatibility\nwith the NASA network ground stations and significant effort on\nantenna configurations which reject or protect from earth generated\nradio frequency interference (RFI).\nUpon notification that the frequency bands of operation for the\ntelecommunication links between the TDRS and the users had been changed\nfrom VHF/UHF to S-band, this contractor redirected the remaining effort\nto concentrate on S-band user antennas, specifically those for which\nreliable hardward implementation data was available.\nAccordingly, applicable experience from past and current commercial\nand military space programs has been utilized to arrive at a number of\nantennas which can be considered suitable candidates for user spacecraft\nmissions. Notwithstanding the elimination of VHF and UHF for the links,\nthe preliminary data gathered on antennas for these bands is nevertheless\nincluded in this report at the end of Section 4, User Antenna Study.\n1-1\n\n2. SUMMARY\n2.1 General TDRSS Concept\nThe TDRSS concept employs two synchronous altitude geostationary\nsatellites deployed in order to provide telecommunication links between\nmultiple earth-orbiting satellites and a centrally located ground\nstation(i). The benefits of employing a data relay satellite system are:\n(1) Increased user real-time data capability\n(2) A possible reduction of user satellite on-board data storage\n(3) A possible reduction of the geographic extent and complexity\nof the NASA ground tracking and data network.\nFigure 2.1 shows the general configuration of the overall system.\nTDRS E is stationed above the Atlantic and TDRS W is above the Pacific\nOcean. The communication links from the ground station to the user\nare defined as forward links, while the links from the user spacecraft\nto the ground station are defined as return links.\nAlthough the overall system concept embraces three categories of\nuser, that is, high, medium, and low data rate types, the category\nexclusively dealt with in this study is the low data rate (LDR) type.\nFor this service both the forward and return links are implemented with\nbroad coverage (26 degree field of view) antennas aboard the TDRS.\nTo put this report into proper perspective, it is of value to\ndiscuss the characteristics of two major interacting constituents of\nthe system: the TDRS itself and the user satellites.\n*Although the nomenclature for this service has been recently changed\nto the Multi-Access Service (MAS), the term LDR will be used\nthroughout the remainder of this report.\n2-1\n\n0\n.:: :;:\" U\nGROUND\nSTATION C\nUSER\n.. ..

TDRS System Concept\n2-2\n\n2.2 User and TDRS Characteristics\nThe LDR links between a TDRS and user spacecraft employ broad\ncoverage TDRS antennas, accommodating user spacecraft with orbital alti-\ntudes up to 3300 km. Examination of the NASA '78, '79, and '80 Mission\nModels in Appendix A* shows the majority of users to be orbiting at 300\nto 1000 km, which is well within the range of the field of view of the\nTDRS antennas. To give some idea of the distribution of the users,\nFigure 2.2 shows a mission model summary derived from Appendix A, in\nthe form of a density profile. Each dot in the figure represents a\ndifferent user mission. Also shown is a profile of the user orbital\ninclinations which shows the distribution tends to bunch at around 300\nand polar orbit inclinations.\nThe forward link was defined by the contract Statement of Work(2)\nto operate at UHF and was subsequently changed(3) to S-band (in the\n2025 to 2120 MHz range). The range of forward link bit rates to be con-\nsidered is 100 to 1024 bits per second. Effective system noise temper-\nature of the user at S-band is defined as 1500 K.\nThe return link from the user, originally at VHF and subsequently\nalso changed to S-band (in the 2200 to 2300 MHz range) is to provide a\nrange of bit rates of 1 to 10 kilobits per second.\nThe relevant TDRS characteristics include a 25 dBW equivalent\nisotropically radiated power (EIRP) at the edge of the field of view; a\nreceiver antenna gain of 28 dB over the field of view; and an effective\nsystem noise temperature of 540 K. These figures are consistent with\nthe latest Hughes TDRS baseline(1)\nA summary of these parameters and characteristics which will be\nused throughout the remainder of this report is'shown in Table 2.1.\n*Received from the Study Project Office on 18 July 1972. The following\nwere eliminated from the models: Deep Space, Geosynchronous, Elliptical\nOrbit Users, and Medium and High Data Rate Users.\n2-3\n\n10100 ::...\n-90. 1800\nLU\nLII\n0 80* 1600\n70 c 1400Zz LUo LU\n0-60 5 1200\nz -50* 1000:\nZ U\n40 800\n<*\n30 ** 600**co0 = •\n20 LU 400:.\nLU\nS10 200\n00\n20717-2666 0 0\nFigure 2.2.

For the lower part of this range of say 100-200 bps, the\n6 -9 dB of antenna gain required is shown in Section 4 to be achievable\nwith modest antennas such as spirals of helices. Howeverc, above 200bps.\nthe antenaa gain requirements on the user become more difficult to\nachieve with simple antennas.\nTwo methods of easing the user's antenna gain requirements on the\nforward link are an increase in TDRS EIRP and a decrease in the user's\nreceiving system noise temperature. With respect to the latter, the\ncurrent Hughes baseline for the TDRS itself employs bipolar silicon tran-\nsistors which provide a system noise temperature of 540 K. A reduction in\nthe user's effective noise temperature to this value from the currently\nestimated 1500 K produces a decrease in antenna gain of almost 4.5 dB.\nThus, it is believed that some combination of increased TDRS EIRP and\nreduced user noise temperature is needed to permit the use of relatively\nmodest user antennas to achieve the full range of specified forward\nlink rates.\n2-7\n\n2.4 Analysis Summary\nCalculations are performed in Section 3 in which visibility\ntime, expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period, is determined\nas a function of the beamwidth of the user antenna. Visibility is\nassumed to exist when a TDRS falls within the user's antenna beam. Cases\nare examined for the two orbital inclinations (33 and 990) which dominate\nthe mission model and for antennas which are either fixed, partially\ngimballed, or capable of being fully gimballed. The resulting data,\nplotted in a series of curves, will aid in preliminary determination of\nthe gimballing and beamwidth constraints for each user depending on the\nfraction of the orbital period over which communication via the TDRS is\ndesired.\nSection 4 consists of a comparative examination of candidate\nantennas for the user spacecraft. The alternatives presented include low\ngain antennas which are usually fixed rather than.gimballed, and medium\ngain antennas which require either gimballing or switching between separate\nantennas for optimum telecommunication visibility with the TDRS's.\nPresented for consideration also in this section is a series of spacecraft\nantennas for which actual hardware experience has been accumulated. These\ninclude antennas from such early space programs as Surveyor and SYNCOM\nto the most recent such as the Canadian domestic communications satellite,\nAnik, and proposed missions such as the HS-507 Pioneer Venus spacecraft.\n2-8\n\n3. USER/TDRS COVERAGE AND MUTUAL VISIBILITY STUDY\n3.1 Methodology and Ground Rules\nThe purpose of this section is to determine the maximum and minimum\nperiods of mutual visibility between a typical user spacecraft and at\nleast one of two TDRS's. It is assumed that mutual visibility exists when\na TDRS falls within the antenna beam of the user satellite. The TDRS space-\ncraft have been taken to be in geosynchronous orbits. The coverage and\nvisibility analysis in this section is valid regardless of actual TDRS\nlongitudinal position as long as a constant separation between the two\nTDRS's is maintained. For purposes of this analysis, a separation of\n1160 has been assumed.\nAnalysis of the NASA '78, '79, '80 mission models (Appendix A) shows\nthat the TDRSS users have predominately low altitude circular orbits with\ninclinations of 330 and 990. Beamwidths ranging from 300 to 1000 have been\nused in the analysis, which is consistent with the frequencies and antenna\nsizes considered here.\nThree cases have been investigated:\n1) No gimballing of the antenna\n2) ± 900 gimballing of the antenna about an axis parallel to the\norbit normal direction\n3) Gimballing of the antenna through the maximum possible gimbal\nangle ±a as defined in Figure 3.1.\nFor each case noted the task can be described as follows: For a\nparticular user orbital inclination, altitude and antenna beamwidth,\ncalculate the maximum and minimum communication time between the user and\none or both TDRS for a revolution of the user's orbit. The duration\nof communication is then defined as the sum of all periods of mutual\nvisibility taking place within the span of one orbital period of the user\nspacecraft. Several revolutions of the user's orbit are examined to\ndetermine the true maximum and minimum values of total visibility time.\nFor convenience the results are expressed in terms of a percentage of\nthe orbital period.\n3-1\n\nSpacecraft /\n/ Rte\nEarth r TDRS\n- User Orbit\nFigure 3.1. Maximum User Antenna\nGimbal Angle o\n3-2\n\n3.2 Mathematical Model(4)\nThe approach taken is to determine the radius vector to the user\nas a function of time in an earth fixed coordinate system and to\ncompare this vector with the constant radius vectors to each TDRS.\nBy comparing these two vectors and rejecting the orbital period times\nwhen the earth intervenes between them, mutual visibility as defined\nabove is determined.\nFor a circular orbit the anomalistic mean motion n can be written as\n2\n3 R e 2n =no 1 ( 1 --sin2i)\nwhere\nn = Keplerian mean motion = e / a30\nJ2 = coefficient of first zonal harmonic of earth's potential\nR = earth's equatorial radiuse\na = circular orbit radius\ni = orbital inclination\nP = earth's gravitational parameter\nRefering to Figure 3.2, at any time t the true anomaly v is simply\nV = n t,\n3-3\n\nEarth-\n/r User S/C11\nEquator\nGreenwich Meridian\nFigure 3.2.

User/TDRS Line-of-Sight Geometry\n3-6\n\nIf L is allowed to represent the line-of-sight direction from the user\nto the TDRS, then\nL =R -r,\nand, since the user's antenna for Case 1 (no gimballing) is assumed to\npoint outwards along the satellite radius vector, visibility exists if\n< cosa IL 2 3\nwhere\ne = user antenna beamwidth\nFor Case 2 (t 900 gimballing) two conditions must be met for communi-\ncations to be possible. First, the line-of-sight vector l must be\nwithin 900 of the radius vector (see Figure 3.3), i.e., the following\nmust hold:\nr * L> 0.\nSecondly, allowing movement of the antenna through f900 about an axis\nparallel to the orbitnormal and letting the unit vector T represent the\nantenna pointing direction anywhere along the 1800 sweep, in order for\nvisibility to exist, the following condition must hold:\n7 q- cos\nFor Case 3 (t gimballing), the conditions that must be met are the\nsame as for Case 2 except that the first inequality is replaced by\nr • L\na L cos 0\n3-7\n\nFigure 3.4.

For Cases 1 and 2 analysis indicates that communi-\ncation time is essentially independent of user orbital altitude for\n300 km ! h : 1000 km, and thus altitude does not appear as a parameter\nin the results for these cases. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and minimum\nvisibility times that will be experienced between the user and at least\none TDRS for Case 1 (no gimballing). The visibility times are expressed\nas a percentage of the user's orbital period and as a function of user\nantenna beamwidth. Figure 3.4a is for a user orbital inclination of 330\n00and Figure 3.4b is for i = 99 . As can be seen from the first curve a\nminimum of zero communication time exists for beamwidths of 650 or\nless. This means that for this antenna size there will be some revol-\nutions of the user orbit for which no communication is possible with the\nTDRSs. A similar condition exists for user orbits inclined at 990 for\n300 ! e 1000 (Figure '3.4b). Figure 3.4 also shows that the maximum\nvisibility time for i = 990 is consistently less than that for i = 330\nwhen compared at the same beamwidth. This is to be expected since\nin the latter orientation the TDRS is never as far out of the user\norbit plane as for the polar type orbits, and it is this out-of-plane\ndistance that determines visibility time.\nFigure 3.5 presents an example of the geographic extent of the\nvisibility regions for each TDRS when viewing a low altitude 330 inclined\nuser orbit. For illustrative purposes, the TDRS's are assumed to be\nstationed at 190 W and 1350 W longitude. A user antenna beamwidth of 900\nis assumed for the case of no antenna gimballing. Communications with a\nparticular TDRS is possible only when the user subsatellite point falls in\nthe TDRS visibility region. Jointly, the two regions depicted in Figure\n3.5 will allow the user spacecraft to communicate with one TDRS or the\nother from 25% to 42% of the time (Figure 3.4a). Similar curves could be\ngenerated for the other cases.\n3-9\n\nRAND MNALLYWORLDRANDMCNLLYAMERICAS CENTER21)\n9* 1 to* EAST 150' LO GIIUDE 180* 1 0- 1 WE ST 90* LONG17UDE 600O AS 30 LONGITUDE 60, 0\n-Figure 3.5.

As can be seen from the curve a minimum value of\nzero exists for user antenna beamwidths less than 570, and increases to\n76% at 9 = 1000. Maximum visibility time increases rapidly from 48%\nfor a 300 beam to a constant upper bound of 85% at 0 = 400. The upper\nbound is the same for all beamwidths since for Case 2 it is required\nthat r * LT> 0, i.e., : (r, L) < 900.\nFigure 3.7 describes the maximum visibility times for a user orbital\n0inclination of 99 .As with Case 1 the minimum communication time is\nzero for all beamwidths considered. The maximum remains constant at\n46% for beamwidths less than about 55%. At this point, the curve rises\nsharply to 87% for 0 t 700. This seemingly strange behavior can be\nexplained by noting that for small beamwidhts only one TDRS at a time\ncan fall near enough to the orbit plane of the user for communications\nto be possible. Thus, the lower level of the maximum visibility curve\n(46%) represents communications with just one TDRS. When the beamwidth\nis sufficiently large to allow communication with either TDRS at the\nsame place in the user's orbit*, then the upper level of the maximum\ncurve results.\nFor the case of gimballing the user antenna through the angle +\nthe results are presented in Figures 3.8 and 3.9. The curves are\nsimilar to those described earlier with two exceptions. First, since\na is a function of altitude**, the maximum and minimum visibility\ntimes become a function of altitude as well, and the results are shown\n0* For a 90 polar orbit this requirement amounts to\n0 e 1800 I) TDRS1 XTDRS I\n1 2\n** 01 = -sin l()(Figure 3.1).\n3-11\n3-11\n\nFigure 3.6.

As can be seen from Figure 3.8\nthe same kind of behavior is displayed by the visibility curves as\nwas seen in Figure 3.6 (- 900 gimballing, i = 330). Since , > 900,\nincreased communication time is expected, and in fact, both the\nmaximum and minimum curves in Figure 3.8 do represent greater periods\nof visibility than those of Figure 3.6.\nFigure 3.9 presents the maximum visibility times for a user in-\nclination of 990 for Case 3. As before, near polar orbits result in\na zero minimum visibility time for all beamwidths. And, as in the\ncase of _900 gimballing, a rapid increase in communication time occurs\nin the vicinity of 9 = 600, essentially doubling visibility time for\nthe larger beamwidths.\n3.4 Conclusions and Recommendations\nIt has been the intent of this section to provide potential users\nof the TDRSS with sufficient data to allow preliminary determination\nof the constraints imposed upon the user antenna design as a result of\nuser communication requirements. If a minimum value can be set on\ncommunication time, than for a particular orbital geometry, the data\npresented herein allows the user to determine both the optimum antenna\nbeamwidth and the antenna gimballing scheme.\nIt is recommended that subsequent visibility studies be performed to\ninvestigate the impact of: (1) pointing the antenna along the orbit\nnormal direction or along the velocity vector; (2) gimballing the\nantenna about an axis other than the orbit normal, e.g., the velocity\nvector, etc.; and (3) allowing two degrees of freedom in antenna\ngimballing. Furthermore, a small number of spacecraft are not referenced\nto the earth, but are either inertially oriented or are oriented with\nrespect to the sun. An example of the latter is the Orbiting Solar\nObservatory (OSO). For these cases, similar visibility studies ean be\nperformed.\n3-16\n\n4. USER ANTENNA STUDY\n4.1 Introduction\nThe antenna on the user spacecraft is one of the most critical\nelements in the telecommunications link with the TDRS. An antenna has\nmass, requires space, usually protrudes from the spacecraft body and\noften imposes attitude control, gimballing, and deployment constraints,\nUnlike conventional satellite-to-ground telemetry and command antennas,\nthose on the user are required to exhibit some directivity toward the\nsynchronous altitude TDRS. The higher the achievable gain, the better,\nsince each additional dB of gain in the link is directly translatable\nto a higher supportable user bit rate.\nA major factor limiting the telecommunications link performance is\nterrestrially generated radio frequency interference (RFI). The basic\ngeometry of this RFI problem is shown in Figure 4.1. Each TDRS sees more\nthan 40 percent of the earth's surface, and the LDR return link antenna\ncollects noise power from all emitters in the visible region. The RFI\nnoise level seen by each TDRS will vary slowly, since each TDRS always\nviews the same large region. A low altitude user spacecraft views a\nconsiderably smaller portion of the earth's surface, and therefore is\naffected by a lesser number of RFI emitters, but. is much closer to these\nemitters, effectively receiving higher power per emitter than the TDRS.\nA user, orbiting over high and low RFI emitting regions, experiences a\nwide range of RFI variations.\nThe most detailed estimate of the RFI that can be experienced by\nsynchronous satellites in the frequency ranges previously allocated to\n(5)the LDR service has been made by ESL, Inc. in a 1972 study for NASA(5)\nThese estimates were based on an emitter library containing the location,\nantenna pattern, transmitter power, etc., of about 45,000 RFI sources.\n4-1\n\n35,900 km\n4-2\n\nIn view of the foregoing, a number of requirements must be imposed on\nthe user spacecraft antenna design. To achieve maximum bit rates, the user\nreceiving antenna should attain its maximum gain in the direction of the\nTDRS and at the same time achieve minimum gain towards the sources of RFI\nvia the antenna side and back lobes. For the return link, the only avail-\nable method on the user satellite of attempting to overcome the RFI problem\nis to achieve as high an EIRP in the direction of the TDRS as possible\nwithout regard to the side and back lobes.\nThe recent shift in link frequencies from VHF/UHF to S-band (2.25 GHz)\neased the requirements on the user in a number of respects. The primary\nfactor is that terrestrially generated RFI no longer appears to be the\ndominating influence on the user antenna. This fact is evident for two\nreasons. First, the number of terrestrial transmitters at 2 GHz is far less\nthan the profuse numbers which exist globally at VHF and low UHF. An allo-\ncation of a small slot of frequency spectrum needed for the LDR service is\nprobably much easier to obtain relatively interference-free at S-band than\nin the lower bands.\nFurthermore, whereas the almost 3-to-i frequency difference between\nthe UHF and VHF links precluded the use of a single antenna for both links,\nthat possibility can now be considered at S-band. Also, at S-band the\naperture becomes smaller and the radiation pattern interaction between the\nantenna elements and the spacecraft structure becomes less severe.\nDespite the fact that VHF and UHF have been deleted, the\npreliminary data gathered on antennas for these frequency ranges are in-\ncluded in this section for the purpose of completeness.\n4-3\n\nDuring the study effort, discussion with the GSFC User Impact\nStudy program office(3) led to a request for this contractor to submit\ndata on antennas which have been designed in-house. That is, emphasis\nis to be on hardware experience with data points extrapolated where\nnecessary to the proper S-band frequency. These antennas, which are\nidentified in Section 4.3, represent viable candidates for the user\nspacecraft since their weights and functions are more in line with anti-\ncipated user missions. Primarily because the data collected on S-band\nantennas has assumed a greater significance, this information is pre-\nsented in Section 4.3, whereas the data on VHF and UHF antennas (plus\nscaled information for S-band) is held off until Section 4.4.\n4-4\n\n4.2 Technical Considerations\nAntennas performing over the three distinct bands of VHF, UHF and\nS-band have been considered in this study. For these bands the same\nantenna types are applicable; the only differences being a scaling of\nsize and weight. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are based on data presented in\nSection 4.4. Not all configurations of the same generic type of antenna\nare included. For example, only a disc-on-rod antenna is included for\nendfire type antennas, although there are many others -- helix, pokyrod,\nyagi, etc.\nTypical families of antennas representative of different types are\nsummarized in Section 4.4. This collection although not exhaustive serves\nas a basis of comparison of different generic types by categorizations\naccording to gain, size, weight, etc.\n4.2.1 Antenna Environments and Antenna/Spacecraft Interaction\nThe immediate area in the vicinity of the antenna elements is\nconsidered the antenna \"environment.\" The detailed constituencies\nand characteristics of this environment have a profound effect on\nthe shape of the resulting antenna radiation pattern. As frequencies\nbecome higher and consequently wavelengths smaller, the interacting\neffect between the antenna elements and the surrounding environment\nbegins to decrease thus allowing the radiation pattern to become more\npurely the result of the antenna elements themselves. (6)\nThus, the effects of booms, other antennas, protruding equipment,\nsupporting structures, and even the basic spacecraft structure itself\npresent a variety of critical interacting influences. For the most\npart ascertaining these effects analytically is difficult and experi-\nmental techniques must be resorted to by the spacecraft designer.\n4-5\n\nTable 4.1 Classification of Omnidirectional Antennas\n$cc 0 0 0 0\n* cd 4 V0 ** P\nUnfurlable Turnstile 2 5 2.7 1.0 0.2 Large Stored+ X\nSlotted Dipole Cone 2 5 3.4 1.1 0.2 Large None X\nStripline Turnstile 2.5 20 2.7 1.0 0.2 Medium None X\nCavity Fed Slot 2.5 20 3.4 1.1 0.2 Medium None X\nDiscone 3 17 4.1 1.4 0.26 Large Stored+ X\nEnergy\nCup Dipole 3 rnstile23 2 5 2.7 1.4 0.26 LargMedium Stored+ x\nEnergy\nSlottargely dependent on spacecraft size in wavelengths.\n+At S-band Sloantenna size is sma, alleviating deploymen requirements in all bum remote applications.\n+At S-band antenna size is small, alleviating deployment requirements in all but remote applications.\n\nTable 4.2 Classification of Medium Gain Antennas\n010 +\nDipole Array 15 13.6 4.5 0.83 Medium Stored X\nEnergy\nEnergy\nDipole Planar Array 8 25 16.3 .4 1,0 Small Stored or x\nEnergyDisc-On-Rod 9 25 6.0 2.3 0.43 Small Stored or X\nEnergy \"Prime Focus Reflector 10.5 22 20.0 6.8 1.2 Small External X\n*Largely dependent on spacecraft size in wavelengths\n+Little, if at all, applicable to S-band implementation because size of element is small.+Little, if at all, applicable to S-band implementation because size of element is small.\n\n20\nO16\n12\n0 0.5 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\nSATELLITE-TO-ANTENNA SIZE RATIO\nFigure 4.2 Typical Low Gain Antenna/Spacecraft Interaction\n4-8I-\n;-r\n4-8\n\nOne more factor affecting this interaction is the gain of\nthe antenna itself. The higher the gain, the less the interacting effect.\nGenerally speaking, antennas available to the user spacecraft\ndesigner can be separated into two distinct categories, that is, medium\nand low gain designs. The associated design problems and required system\ntrades are in many respects different and can be discussed separately for\nthese two separate classes of antennas.\nThe medium gain antennas, ranging in gains of about 10-15 dB, must\nusually be mechanically steered in order to keep the beam pointed at the\nTDRS because they have narrow beamwidths. In these ranges of antenna gain,\nthere is a lower tendency for the pattern to be affected by the spacecraft\nstructure as compared to the lower gain antennas.\nFor the lower gain a:tennas, falling in the range of gains of\n2-5 dB, generally the opposite is true. Because of their relatively broad\nbeamwidths, it may not be necessary to steer the elements continuously\nto keep the beam pointed toward the TDRS. Along with this advantage, however,\ncomes the disadvantage of having lower discriminating protection against\nunwanted RFI arriving via the antenna radiation pattern side and back lobes.\nFurthermore, the structural integration of their elements into an overall\nspacecraft structural design is rendered difficult because of the afore-\nmentioned effect of basic :pattern interaction with the structure.\nWhen a low gain antenna is put on a satellite structure several\nvariables modify the basic antenna radiation pattern (the intrinsic\npattern in absence of the satellite body). The two most signfiicant\nvariables are the antenna size versus the satellite structure size.\nThe curve illustrated in Figure 4.2 shows a typical test result from\nNRL test analysis(6) of spacecraft interaction effects with satellite\nstructures. In this test, a turnstile antenna was mounted on a spherical\nspacecraft body. For varying spacecraft to antenna size, various degrees\nof pattern differences were observed. Generally speaking, as the satellite\nsize is increased more numerous and deeper null appear as part of the\n4-9\n\ncomposite antenna/spacecraft characteristic. Besides spacecraft size,\nthere are other factors affecting the antenna design; among the more\nimportant are geometry, element type and its location. Material properties\nhave, at least for the turnstile design, been found to effect changes in\nperformance.\nBecause of the numerous variables involved in the specification\nof the ultimate radiation characteristics of a low gain antenna, the antenna\nsystem integration problem is extremely difficult. Generally speaking\nbefore a system engineer can objectivdly select an appropriate design for\nhis mission he is required to understand the impact of all spacecraft\nstructural effects on all antennas from which he is making a selection so\nthat he may choose the design which is more optimum for his application.\nThis type of required data, unfortunately, is not readily available. It\ncouldhowever be determined partially through a systematic investigation.\nIn order to establish which low gain antenna design is most\nappropriate to a particular spacecraft geometry, it is valuable to conduct\neither a survey or a numerical and experimental investigation. The\nexperimental approach involves the fabrication of various spacecraft\nstructures and testing them in conjunction with different antenna configura-\ntions. A similar, however, for the same cost, more complete evaluation\ncould be conducted analytically. A hybrid approach using methods in unison\nproduces the best results when applied during the actual hardware development\nstage after which the antenna selection has already been completed. During\nthis stage the numerical analysis could be used to provide initial\ninsight with final design being verified by experiment.\n4-10\n\nOf the three methods of studying the spacecraft antenna interaction\nproblem, it is believed the analytical approach is by far the most\npromising. It gives the capability by which a more complete set of\nparametric data can be derived; it lends itself more readily to changes,\nand it is particularly useful to assessing performance effects which are\nsubject to design perturbations.\nThe available numerical techniques for analysis of structural inter-\nferences on antenna radiation characteristics can be divided into three\ndifferent formulation methods. These methods are the most important ones\navailable to date and utilize the following techniques:\na) Electromagnetic integral equation formulation\nb) Wire-grid modeling\nc) Geometrical diffraction theory\nEach method has its range of applicability, accuracy and complexity.\nThe geometrical theory of diffraction(7 8, 9) is best suited for the\nanalysis of scattering problems where the interfering structures are\nlarge compared to a wavelength. Generally speaking the larger the struc-\nture the better the accuracy of the model. The technique is analogous\nconceptually to that of ray tracing.\nThe wire-grid modeling technique(10' 11) is based on the premise that\na solid conducting body may be substituted by a grid of thin wires con-\nfigured to correspond to the geometry of the scatterer.. Using this grid\nthe unknown currents excited by the incident field may be determined by a\nsystem of simultaneous equations. Satisfactory application of this tech-\nnique requires sufficiently short wire grid segments about 0.1 wavelengths.\nOnce the currents on the grids are established, the corresponding reradiated\nfields can be calculated and then added to the primary field resulting in\nthe total field of the antenna.\n4-11\n\nThe technique using the magnetic field integral equation (12,13) is\nsimilar to that of the wire mesh. The advantages of this method are\nthat it is theoretically more exact (neglecting mutual coupling), it\nimposes no restrictions on the materials of the medium, and it provides\npolarization insight because of its utilization of field vector formu-\nlation.\nAlthough use of this latter technique has shown that individual\ndeviation between the theoretical and experimental pattern of an antenna\nobstructed by a spacecraft can differ by as much as 5 dB, on the average\nthe agreement is considerably better.\nOne particular advantage of the integral equation formulation is that\nit is sufficiently general with respect to the primary sources and\nconsequently any source antenna may be used as an input to the analysis.\nIn addition, once the matrix describing the scattering surface has been\ngenerated, it can be reused at relatively little additional expense in\nterms of computer utilization to determine the antenna location for an\noptimal combined radiation pattern.\nClearly, studies of this form are bpyond the scope of this study.\nThey have been highlighted in order to point out that valuable further\nstudies in this field may be performed to aid the user spacecraft designer\nin determining the type and location of an antenna for use with the TDRSS.\n4-12\n\n4.2.2 Mounting and Deployment\nAntenna location is generally a compromise between field-of-view\nrequirements and the availability of space and payload mass for the\nsatellite system. Omnidirectional antennas are often the most difficult\nto locate as their spherical field of view requirement is most difficult\nto achieve. Omnidirectional antennas are accordingly mounted on booms\nand masts to achieve a wide angle field of view.\nData return from satellites at low bit rates can be achieved with\nlow EIRP. This provides an opportunity to use broadbeam, low gain\nantennas which do not require steering or tracking. For example, a\nslotted dipole cone type antenna will provide 2 dB gain over a hemispherical\nfield of view. This antenna could be mounted on a short mast located\naway from the earth and nearly complete orbital coverage provided with a\ntwo satellite relay system. Care would need to be exercised to avoid\ninterference with solar cell arrays or other movable equipments.\nSatellite telecommunication subsystem designs for higher data rates,\nwhich require higher EIRP for reliable transmission may require a balance\nbetween antennas, transmitters and power supply in order to minimize\noverall equipment mass. Minimum mass configurations generally occur at\nthat design point where the mass required for the antenna with its installa-\ntion is approximately equal to the sum of the mass of the transmitter, its\ninstallation and power supply allocation. Thus a switched beam or\nelectrically steered beam may be an appropriate design for the higher data\nrate users. In this case an unobstructed field of view is required for\nthe installation of any element in a switched beam configuration and a\ncomplete unobstructed field of view is required for all elements in an\nelectrically steered beam configuration. Mechanical gimbals may also be\nemployed for high gain antennas where the mass of a phased array antenna\nwould be prohibitive. It is judged that antennas I meter or more in\ndiameter should use mechanical beam steering. Such an antenna would have a\npeak gain of 25 dB at 2.25 GHz. It may then be concluded that mechanical\nbeam steering would not be appropriate for the low data rate class of user\nsatellites.\n4-13\n\n4.2.3 Antenna Polarization\nTerrestrially-generated RFI is assumed to consist of all\npolarizations of equal power; that is to say, if one were to measure the\npower level of the RFI with a linear polarized antenna, or a right-hand\ncircularly polarized antenna, etc., the power level in each case would\nbe the same. Therefore, there is no advantage in designing an antenna\nwith any particular polarization in an attempt to reduce the level of\nthe RFI. However, the receive signal level can be increased by adjusting\nthe polarization of the transmitting antenna to the receive antenna or\nvice versa.\n4.2.4 Low Gain Semi-Omnidirectional Antennas\nAntennas on the order of a half wavelength are low gain (2-4 dB)\nand radiate nearly uniformly over large sectors. They have the advantages\nof being lightweight, can be easily stowed and deployed, and usually\nrequire no gimballing. They have the disadvantages of large interaction\nwith the spacecraft and unwanted gain in the direction of the RFI.\nThese latter effects can be minimized by placing them above a ground plane\nor inside a cup. Doing so reduces the back radiation with a corresponding\ndecrease in radiated coverage. The degree to which the back radiation\ncan be reduced depends on the size of the ground plane. One-half\nwavelength diameter ground planes are effective when the desired radiation\nis perpendicular to the ground plane. However, when maximum radiation\nis desired parallel to the ground plane, multiple wavelength sizes are\nrequired to reduce the radiation past the edge of the ground plane.\nChokes placed at the edge of a ground plane effectively make it appear\nlarger. The judicious use of the spacecraft structure can also act as\na ground plane to partially shield from RFI sources.\nNeedless to say, directivity improvement by judicious use of\nground plane characteristics can best be implemented at the higher\nfrequencies. Here the wavelengths are relatively small and consequently\ninsignificant structural difficulties arise.\nIn Table 4.1, these antennas have been classified according to\nback radiation, weight, interaction with the spacecraft, stowage and\ndeployment requirements and polarization characteristics.\n4-14\n\n4.2.5 Multiple Wavelength Antennas\nMultiple wavelength antennas can consist of continuous\napertures or arrays of discrete elements. They are normally medium or\nhigh gain and radiate a pencil beam, fan beams or other special beam\nshapes. Continuous apertures include horns, parabolic and spherical\nreflectors, corner reflectors and lenses. They have the advantage of\nsmall interaction with the spacecraft and low back and sidelobes. They\nhave the disadvantages of greater weight, usually require stowage and\ndeployment and require mechanical steerability at the lower frequencies.\nArray antennas consists of discrete radiators, either directly\nor parasitically exited. By varying the phase and amplitude of the\nfed radiating elements, these arrays can radiate anywhere from normal\nto the array (broadside) to parallel to it (endfire). Endfire arrays,\nalthough physically small in the plane orthogonal to the direction of\nmaximum radiation, suffer from the fact that the gain increases only as t\nthe square root of the length. Array type antenna have the advantage\nof small interaction with the spacecraft, and electronic steerability\nin some cases.*\nFor all of the configurations summarized in Section 4.4, the\nS-band designs pose fewer structural problems which allows for greater\nflexibility in the electrical design. Table 4.2 categorizes these\nantennas according to back radiation, weight, interaction with\nspacecraft, polarization and stowage and development characteristics.\n*In all array designs the interaction between the spacecraft structure and\nthe overall pattern is to a significant extent dependent upon the gainof\nthe individual array elements themselves.\n4-15\n\n4.2.6 Antenna Switching\nTwo or more half wavelength antennas which have reduced coverage\nand lower back and sidelobes can be placed at different locations on the\nspacecraft and energized electrically to provide the required coverage.\nSince continuous aperture antennas require mechanical steering to\nprovide greater coverage, additional antennas could be placed on the\nspacecraft and switched in and out eliminating the need for steering.\nAlthough an array type antenna can be electronically scanned, the gain\ndegrades as a function of the scan angle.(14) It may, therefore, be\nadvantageous to provide more than one array and switch between them\ndepending on the look angle required. As pointed out previously, the\ntradeoff between using more than one array and providing higher RF\ntransmitter power depends on the point where minimum user spacecraft\nmass is achieved. Minimum mass configurations have been shown to\noccur at that point where the mass of the antenna is equal to the sum\nof the mass of the transmitter and its power supply.(15)\n4.2.7 Feed Networks\nThe antennas discussed here may be fed by balanced trans-\nmission lines or by coax and a balun (balance-to-unbalance trans-\nformer), and in some cases by waveguide. Care must be taken to insure\nthat the feed lines provide satisfactory isolation. Shielded balanced\ntransmission lines offer the best guard against this since any\ncurrents induced on the shield or spacecraft excite equal currents on\nthe two lines and are therefore RF grounded. When using coax lines the\nouter shield and the spacecraft structure itself must present zero\nresistance to the unwanted induced currents. Waveguide line becomes\nincreasingly attractive from a loss standpoint with increasing fre-\nquency. However, even at S-band physical bulk and weight disadvantages\nstill generally outweigh the electrical advantages. The recommended\npractice, therefore, is to use coaxial cable feed lines.\n4-16\n\n4.2.8 Antenna Weights\nThe antenna weights given in the Tables 4.1 and 4.2 include\nboth the radiating elements and the feed network and represent\nconstruction techniques which make use of modern spacecraft\nantenna structural and materials technology. Techniques\nof construction such as electroforming resulting in wall thickness\nof .013 cm, etching on copper clad polyguide and metal forming has\nsubstantially reduced the weight of antennas. Choices of lightweight\nmaterials such as honeycomb and metal sprayed plastics have become\nmore available. Radiating surfaces, whether directly or parasitically\nexcited, can be perforated with holes up to a half wavelength at the\noperating frequency without serious degradation of performance. In\naddition, surfaces can be formed by half wavelength resonant structures\neliminating the need for solid surfaces. Feed networks have been\ndeveloped in air stripline with reduced weight and power loss.\nThe weights of the Hughes antennas for past space missions\nreflect the materials and structural technology in existence at the\ntime they were designed. Thus, the weights for similar antennas\nto those given in Section 4.3 could be considerably lower in most\ncases if up to date antenna technology were utilized.\n4-17\n\n-FIBERGLASS SLEEVE -0.02 WALL\nFROM TRAVELING- CONDUCTOR\nWAVE TUBE 0.02D\nTEFLON 0.472D 0.08---1'- 002\nST \\ T0.662DO 0.40D 0073'0\nRECEIVER r-40 0.22\n091 4.321-9- 41.4021 02522\n0.9 4.46312 -- 4.321 -- 0734 025\nD= DIAMETER\nWALLS: 0.015 IN.

SYNCOM Antenna Configuration\n4-18\n\n4.3 S-Band Antenna Studies\nIn order to obtain practical satellite S-band antenna hardware\ndata, this contractor was requested to specifically examine and report\non actual satellite antenna designs. This section presents electrical\nand mechanical performance data for various Hughes satellite antennas,\neither actual or proposed hardware designs. Where data for the proposed\nTDRS S-band frequency was not available, the actual designs were extra-\npolated in terms of mass and dimensions from their operating frequencies.\n4.3.1 SYNCOM(16)\nThe SYNCOM antenna required an omnidirectional pattern in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis of satellite rotation and a directional or\nflattened \"pancake\" pattern in the plane containing the axis. This was\nachieved by an array of three collinear skirted dipoles mounted on and\nextending from the axis of rotation. Figure 4.3 shows the configuration\nof the SYNCOM antenna. The dipoles are center-fed by annular slots in a\ncoaxial transmission line. A single skirted receiving dipole (for operation\nat 8 GHz) is shown at the right-hand tip of the antenna structure.\nThe measured antenna radiation patterns provided by the SYNCOM\nantenna are shown in Figure 4.4 for both azimuth and elevation cuts. It\nis noted that the SYNCOM antenna operated at 1.8 GHz, however, scaling the\ndimensions to 2.25 GHz for TDRS has negligible effect on the overall antenna\nweight, which at 1.8 GHz was 2 kilograms. The overall antenna performance\nand characteristics are given in Table 4.3.\n4-19\n\nTable 4.3 SYNCOM Antenna Characteristics\nAntenna type Skirted collinear dipoles\nPeak gain 6 dB\nBeamwidth 24 degrees\nDimensions 40 centimeters long\nWeight 2 kg including support and deployment mechanism\nMounting Skirts mounted on rod concentric with spin axis\nMaterials Aluminum, fiberglass, Teflon\nPolarization Circular\nComments Pancake beam; spring-actuated unfolding deploy-\nment mechanism\n4.3.2 Surveyor (17)\nThe high gain Surveyor antenna was a mechanically steerable\ncircularly polarized slot planar array.

Surveyor Planar Array and Antenna Patterns\n\n4.3.3 Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO)(18)\nThe OSO-I S-band antenna consists of a cavity backed circumferential\nslotradiator excited by 64 evenly spaced probes fed in phase. The slot\nradiator is covered with a fiberglass radome. A stripline corporate feed\nis associated with each quadrant; the outputs of the four corporate feeds\nconnect to a 4-way power divider. The antenna is designed to provide\napproximately -6 dB gain over a nearly spherical coverage area. The pre-\ndominant radiation is polarized in the plane of the spacecraft wheel spin\naxis. Elliptical polarization occurs in the region of the polar axis.\nA schematic of a portion of the OSO \"bellyband\" antenna is shown\nin Figure 4. 7. In addition to the probes and S-band cavities shown, two\nVHF whip antennas are integrated with and protrude from each quadrant of\nthe slot array. The resulting S-band radiation patterns are shown in\nFigure 4.8.

Bicone Antenna\n4-28\n\n4.3.4 Bicone Antennas\nThe Bicone antenna, by virtue of its omnidirectionality in the plane\nperpendicular to the spin axis of a spin-stabilized spacecraft, has been used\non several Hughes-designed and launched spacecraft. These include the USAF\nTactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT), (19) the INTELSAT IV, and the Canadian\nDomestic Satellite, ANIK. Of these, the TACSAT bicone operates at 2 GHz,\nwhereas the commercial satellites operate at 4 GHz for telemetry.\nThe two cones which make up the aperture, shown in Figure 4.9,\nare usually spun out of sheet aluminum. The circular guide in the\ncenter is machined from aluminum stock, the slots are then machined,\nand the cones are then spot-welded to the circular guide. The bicones\nare then housed in a fiberglass thermal shield and mounted on top of\nthe spacecraft.\nA set of radiation patterns for the bicone antenna is shown in\nFigure 4.10.

The antenna consists of two plane reflectors\nspaced approximately a half wavelength apart with the feed placed between\nthem. The primary reflector is cupped to form a cavity. The antenna\nsurfaces can be made from either perforated sheet metal or wire mesh with\naluminum ribs. Stowage and deployment of this type of antenna will be\nnecessary in most instances.\nTypical radiation patterns for the backfire antenna are shown in\nFigure 4.12, and characteristics and performance are summarized in Table\n4.7.\nTable 4.7 Short Backfire Antenna Characteristics\nAperture diameter 26.7 cm\nPeak gain 15.5 dB\nPolarization Linear or circular\nWeight 1 kg\nMaterials Perforated sheet metal or Chromel-R wire\nmesh with aluminum ribs\n4.3.6 Quadrifilar Helix Antenna (21)\nA potentially attractive user antenna is the fractional-turn\nquadrifilar helix. Such an antenna is theoretically capable of achieving\napproximately a 3 dB gain relative to an isotropic circularly polarized\nreference with less than 3 dB axial ratio over a beamwidth of 130 degrees.\nThe configuration of such an antenna is shown in Figure 4.13. Typical\ndimensions for 2.25 GHz are also given in the figure.

Quadrifilar Helical CP Element\n4-34\n\nThe quadrifilar helix antenna has the desirable property of\nreversing the direction of the pattern null, causing the beam to cover\nthe opposite hemisphere, by reversing the phase of the feed between bifilar\nelements.(22) Consequently, a set of three such antennas orthogonally mounted\non a user spacecraft could achieve the effect of six selectable elements\nif a dual-mode reversible feed network is implemented in the design. This\ntype of antenna appears to lend itself well to stowage and deployment along\nits axis.\nTypical characteristics of a 2.25 GHz quadrifilar helix antenna\nare given in Table 4.8.\nTable 4.8 Quadrifilar Helix Antenna Characteristics\nElement length 233 cm\nAntenna diameter 26.6 cm\nPeak gain 3 dB\nPolarization Circular\nBeamwidth 130 degrees\nWeight 660 gm\nMaterials Beryllium copper tubing\n(23)\n4.3.7 Monofilar Helix Antenna\nThe helical antenna has the advantage of being smaller in cross-\nsection than other types of radiators with comparable gain and are less\ncomplex than dipoles and slot antennas. The axial mode helical radiator\nis formed by winding a wire in a helix with a pitch angle of from 11 to 16\ndegrees and a diameter of the order of X/3. A metallic ground plane whose\ndimensions are of the order of X is placed at one end of the helix. The\nhelix is usually fed by a coaxial line whose outer conductor terminates\non the ground plane and whose inner conductor passes through the ground\nplane to form the helix. The helix itself may be wound on a dielectric\ntube or supported by dielectric spokes extending from a tube along the\nlongitudinal axis of the helix.\n4-35\n\nGROUND PLANE\nHELICES (PLATED) AND\nON THIN FIBERGLASS TUBE\nFigure 4.14. Monofilar helix antenna\n4-36\n\nAn example of a monofilar helical satellite antenna design\nis the Hughes HS-350 antenna, shown in Figure 4.14. This helix, used\nat S-band, achieves 13 dB gain, weighs 3.3 kg, and measures 30.5 cm\nlong by 5.34 cm in diameter.\n4.3.8 Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Antenna (24)\nThe S-band antenna for the GMS consists of an array of cavity-\nbacked slot radiating elements integrated into the spinting spacecraft\nsolar panel. The beam is constantly despun by switching between adjacent\nmodules (four excited simultaneously) so that the angular rate approximately\nequals the rate of the spinning satellite.\nEach module of the antenna, shown in Figure 4.15, consists of an\narray of three linearly polarized elements. An array of three elements\nprovides the required shaping in the elevation plane. Each element consists\nof a pair of circumferential slots which couple to a waveguide that is\nexcited by a probe. There are a total of six slots in each module.\nPerformance characteristics of the GMS. antenna are given in Table 4.9.\nTable 4.9 GMS Antenna Performance and Characteristics\nType Electronically despun array of cavity-\nbacked slots\nPeak gain 18.7 dB\nBeamwidth 17.6 degrees\nPolarization Vertical linear\nWeight Approximately 180 kg\nDimensions 208 cm diameter annulus\nMounting Structurally integrated with solar panel\nmounted peripherally around spacecraft\n4-37\n\nCAMERA o\nSOLAR CELLS\nTRANSMIT\nANTENNA\n---- TARECEIVE\n12 TANDEM 'ANTENNA\nASSEMBLIES\nSVHF WHIPS\n4 ACTIVE S-BAND\nUHF CAVITY\na) Structural engineering b) Spacecraft and antenna\nmotde.19 configuration(Photo 1N13975)\nFigure 4.15.

This antenna provides a gain greater than\n-6 dB over an angle of 140 degrees centered on the spacecraft forward\nspin axis. Figure 4.16 shows the configuration of the conical log spiral\nantenna and its corresponding radiation pattern.

In particular, four types\nwhich were examined include slotted planar arrays, arrays of helices,\nparaboloidal reflectors and feeds, and rectangular horns. Table 4.10 pro-\nvides a summary of the principal characteristics of each of these antennas.(26)\nThe relationships between the dimensions of the antennas and their\ngains are shown in Figure 4.41 for an operating frequency of 2.25 GHz. In\norder to proceed to an estimation of the relationship between antenna weight\nand gain, assumptions were made as to the materials best suited for their\nfabtication. For example, for an array of helices, lightweight, high-strength\nmaterials such as berylli:nm and magnesium, and dielectric materials such as\nfiberglass and teflon are used. The weights of very large arrays are only\nrough estimates and specific designs for these antenns in a space environment\nhave not been made.\n4-67\n\n2500\n1270\nHORN LENGTH\nw 500\ni\nPLANAR\nz ARRAY\nO 250 SIDE\n127\nO PARABOLIC\nREFLECTOR\nDIAMETER\n50\nHELICAL ARRAY\nLENGTH AND\nDIAGONAL\n25 1\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nANTENNA GAIN, DECIBELS\n'Figure 4441. Comparison of Antenna Sizes\n4-68\n\nFigure 4.42 shows the results of the weight vs. gain comparison.\nIn addition to the four antennas mentioned above, the data collected for\ntwo specific Hughes biconical horns 'are also plotted in the figure. It\nshould be pointed out.that there are several inherent limitations in the\npracticability of this kind of weight versus gain comparison. The data\nplotted are only for the antenna elements themselves and exclude such\nitems as diplexers, antenna control electronics, gimbals, supporting\nstructures, rotary joints, etc. This exclusion compensates in part for\nthe fact that on a weight basis, directional antenna systems for spin-\nstabilized satellites suffer unfairly because of the requirement for\ndespinning in comparison with antennas.for 3-axis stabilized satellites.\nAlternatively, one could postulate a correction factor to even out this\ncomparison. However, a single correction factor for spinners does not\nappear to be feasible.\nIt is further noted that in general electronically scanned antennas\nare desirable where mechanical motion of the antennas cannot be tolerated\nor the rapidity of the required beam steering exceeds the capabilities of\nmechanical mechanisms. For the user spacecraft and the TDRSS geometry\nunder consideration, neither of the requirements for mechanical motion\nor rapidity-of beam steering apply. Thus, based on this consideration\nalone, only mechanically steered or switched, or fixed antennas should be\nconsidered for application by the users.\nIt is for the above mentioned reasons that the weight versus gain\ncomparison given here should be used only-as a rough guide to give insight\ninto the choice of user antenna selection, and not for the selection itself\nbased on minimum weight.\n4-69\n\nA Electronically despun array of linearly polarize d\n---- ...cavity backed slots (GMS\n-- )_ 0 TELESAT -Bicone (scaled in frequency)\n0 o TACSAT Bicone\na Surveyor Planar Array\n20---iJ, 1  I ___\n200 ----- ---H--.. ___' -7. ..- ,-. -\ni \"- I i i,: ...

SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS\n5.1 Telecommunication Link Budgets\nThis section presents an examination of the most recent\nTDRS system characteristics and performance parameters. The\ncalculations of some parameters will be explained in detail and\nthe sources of each of the assumptions will be clarified.\n5.1.1 Free-Space Loss\nThe free-space loss is given by:\nA (dB) = 32.4 + 20 log f (MHz) + 20 log d (km)\nSince the link frequencies are nominally 2.2 GHz, and using\nthe maximum distance of 44,000 km from the user to the TDRS, the\nfree-space loss is:\nA = 192 dBo\n5.1.2 User Transmitter Power and Antenna Gain\nThe values for user antenna gain and transmitter power will\nbe left variable to be determined by the user mission, the needed\ndata rate being the primary influencing factor. Two values of\ntransmitter power will subsequently be assumed for purposes of illus-\ntrating antenna gain versus data rate: 1 watt and-5 watts delivered\nto the antenna terminals. Although the Statement of Work for the study\nspecified a user transmitter power of 1 watt, it is not unreasonable\nto assume that some users can deliver 5 watts of RF power to the\nantenna terminals.\n5-1\n\n5.1.3 TDRS Antenna Gain and User Receiving System Noise\nTemperature\nThe TDRS S-band antenna gain over field of view of 260 is\ntaken as 28 dB. This value was specified at a meeting with the User\nImpact Study Project Office. (3)' The meeting also resulted in specifi-\ncation of the user receiving system noise temperature of 1500 K.\n5.1.4 TDRS Receiving System Noise Temperature\nA value of 540 K receiving system noise temperature for the TDRS\nhas been assumed. This value is believed to be in consonance modern\nS-band receiver front-end technology using bipolar transistors. The re-\nsultant receiving noise power density at the TDRS is -201.3 dBw/Hz-K.\n5.1.5 Bit Energy to Noise Density Ratio\nFor the forward link, with a probability of bit error of\n-510-5 and phase shift keying, a theoretical bit energy to noise density\nratio of 9.6 dB is required. On the return link, convolutional encoding\nwith an optimal decoder using soft decision (K=7, rate ) is assumed.\nThe coding gain thus achievable is 5.5 dB. This results in a required\nbit energy to noise density ratio of 4.1 dB. (27)\n5.1.6 Miscellaneous Losses\nAn overall miscellaneous loss of 3 dB is assumed to account for\npolarization mismatch, transponder loss, demodulation loss, and pseudo-\nnoise (PN) loss.\n5-2\n\n5.1.7 System Margin\nA margin of 3 dB over the threshold of bit energy to noise\ndensity ratio required to give a probability of bit error of l0-5\nis considered necessary to assure confidence that the ultimate system\nperformance is at least the specified value or better.\n5.1.8 Link Budget Tables\nTable 5.1 represents a summary of the forward link calculations\ntaking into account the assumptions made above. The resulting forward\nlink rate is given in terms of the user satellite antenna gain. A\nsimilar set of calculations is summarized for the return link in Table\n5.2 in which the return link rate is given in terms of the available\nuser satellite EIRP.\nThese link budget calculations were performed in the absence\nof RFI.\n5-3\n\nTable 5.1.

From Section 5.1, the\nforward link rate is given by\nR = Gu + 14 dB-Hz\nwhere Gu is the antenna gain on the user satellite.\nThus,\nGu = R -14 = 30.1 -14 = 16.1 dB maximum, and\n= 20 -14 = -6 dB minimum.\nThe bottom half of Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between the\nforward link rate and user antenna gain. It is seen , for example, that a\n500 bps command rate can be achieved with a user antenna gain of 13 dB.\nFor the return link, the Statement of Work requires a minimum\ntelemetry rate of 1 kbps and a maximum of 10 kbps. Again, from\nSection 5.1, the return link rate is given by\nR = EIRP + 27 dB-Hz\nwhere EIRP is the user equivalent isotropically radiated power.\nThus,\nEIRP = R -27 = 40 -27 = 13 dBW maximum, and\n= 30 -27 = 3 dBW minimum.\nFor the two different levels of user RF power, I watt and 5 watts,\nthe top half of Figure 5.1 shows the influence of user antenna gain\non the return link bit rate. A modest 5 dB user antenna gain is seen\nto produce either a 1.6 kilobit .or an 8 kilobits per second return link\nrate, depending on the user's RF power level.\n5-7\n\nA number of conclusions can be drawn from the data rate tradeoffs\nshown in Figure 5.1. First, the return link appears to be adequately\nsized to bracket the user data rates specified in the study Statement\nof Work. Needless to say, the 7 dB difference between the 5 watt and\n1 watt user critically affects the type of antenna required aboard the\nuser satellite. The significance of this dB-for-dB coupling between\nantenna gain and transmitter power can be illustrated by taking a 2.5 kbps\nreturn link rate as an example. The curves show that the 5 watt user\nrequires only a 0 dB antenna gain, whereas the I watt user needs 7 dB.\nAlong with the 0 dB antenna gain comes the inherent quality of omni-\ndirectionality, whereas the 7 dB gain antenna requires either orientation,\nor switching between multiple 7 dB gain antennas, or accepting reduced\nuser orbital coverage by the TDRS if only a single fixed 7 dB antenna gain\ncan be afforded. Thus, wherever possible, to avoid the requirement of\noriented or steered antennas, the user should provide about 5 watts of\nRF power into a low gain antenna.\nGiven the parameters previously assumed, the forward link is\nnot as well matched to the required data rates as the return link. For\nthe ranges of bit rates required by the Statement of Work, that is 100\nbps to 1024 bps, user antenna gains in the range of 6 to 16 dB are required.\nIn order to reduce these gains to more modest levels, it is recommended\nthat either the user's receiving system noise temperature be reduced or the\nTDRS transmit power be increased, or some combination of both. With\nrespect to the former, the current Hughes TDRS baseline makes use of bipolar\nsilicon transistors which provide an overall noise temperature of 540 K,\na reduction of 4.5 dB below the assumed 1500 K user noise temperature. It\nis hoped that such a reduction in noise temperature can also be achieved\nby the users.\n5-8\n\n6. REFERENCES\n1.
