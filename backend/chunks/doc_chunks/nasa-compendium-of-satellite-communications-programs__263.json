The result is that intermodulation distortion becomes an increasingly important consideration in earth station perform­ ance. The higher capacities associated with INTELSAT IV require existing earth .stations to verify a greater linear deviation capability, evaluate their threshold ex­ tension demodulator performance at the larger capacities, augment existing group de­ lay equalization to the larger bandwidths associated with higher capacities, and replace certain traffic bearing and monitoring filters whose bandwidths are related to channel capacity. With the fourth generation of earth stations, new and upgraded terminals, an approach to a \"standard\" earth station has been achieved. Such stations have typical minimum characteristics as shown in Table 10-21. In general, they are required to provide a receive gain of at least 57 dB and a receive G/T of 40.7 dB/ 0 K. Both the transmit and receive chains provide a 500-MHz RF bandwidth. Terminal transmit­ ting feeds are left-hand circularly polarized and receive feeds right-hand circularly polarized. Each terminal, as a minimum, contains both an autotrack and manual tracking capability. Other mandatory performance characteristics of earth stations in the INTELSAT IV system are shown in Table 10-22. The existing, under construction, and planned earth stations are listed in Tables 10-6 through 10-11, and are standard, unless otherwise noted. As of the end of March 1974, 89 earth station antennas were tracking and communicating with INTELSAT IV satellites. By the end of 1974, 107 earth station antennas are expected to be in service.
