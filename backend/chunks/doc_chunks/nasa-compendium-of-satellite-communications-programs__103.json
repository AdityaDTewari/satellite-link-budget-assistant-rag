Solar radiation pressure will limit the lifetime of a dipole belt similar to that deployed to about 3 to 5 years. 5 Propagation effects of the dipole scatter medium are as predicted: a multipath time delay spread of about 100 microseconds and a doppler frequency smear of 1 to 2 kHz were observed several months after dispensing. 6. The various modulation-demodulation techniques operate with a dipole belt at close to their predicted performance; communication rates of several tens of thousands of bits per second were achieved soon after dispensing. 7. The interference of a dipole belt similar to that deployed, with radio astronomy measurements, is negligible as might be theoretically predicted. 5-3 5.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The major experiments performed using the dipole belt were conducted with sites in Massachusetts and California operating as monostatic radars, as a bistatic west-to-east radar, and for west-to-east communications. The eastern site was more heavily instrumented as a r6ceiving station and the western site niore as a transmitting station. Profiagation measurements and communications experiments including high-speed data, teletype, and voice were performed. Belt-scattering cross-section and dimension measurements were made by both monostatic and bistatic radar experiments. The results of these experiments are discussed in Paragraph 5.5. .. .' The choice of frequency rangd for Project West Ford was a compromise among many factors. In the upper UHF. and SHF region, atmospheric noise is negligible. Galactic noise is not of great concern at frequencies- above about 1000 -MHz, nor is the influence'of the ionosphere, in either a quiet or disturbed state. At frequencies of some 3000"}
