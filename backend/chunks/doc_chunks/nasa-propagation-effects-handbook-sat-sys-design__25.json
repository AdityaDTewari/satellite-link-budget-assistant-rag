Theamount ofprecipitation between 1500 and1700 ESTonAugust 17isnoted intheLCDinFigure 2.4-5. This process isutilized todetermine thelist ofdates forthehigh rain rate events. Copies oftherain gauge charts forthese dates arethen obtained from National Climatic Center. FortheAugust 24event, themost accurate data appears directly onthegauge readout shown inFigure 2.4-7. By estimating theslope ofthecumulative data,therain rate just before 4PM wasmore than 4.56 inch/hr (116mm/hr) forthefirst severalminutes. Interpolation yields arate approaching 150mm/hr for2minutes.

Bodtmann andRuthroff (1974)havedemonstratedatechnique of estimating rain rate distributions directly from these rain gauge charts with 1-minute resolution. Since computing derivativesfrom these charts is notoriouslyinaccurate, considerable processingisnecessary togetaccurate results, especially athigh rain rates.
