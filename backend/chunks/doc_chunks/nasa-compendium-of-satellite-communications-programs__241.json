Their existence did, however, provide experience in working with a variety of stations with a wide range of sensitivities. System planning for the INTELSAT III satellite was completed in 1967, and,a third generation of earth stations was designed to provide full operating capability with these spacecraft. Of paramount importance to the INTELSAT III satellite design was the use of two transponders covering nearly the entire 500-MHz band assigned to communications satellite service. The new earth station designs made this entire band available for use so that carrier frequencies could be assigned without regard for narrow-band equipment. This flexibility guaranteed the success of multidestina­ tion FM-FDM to provide complete satellite multiple access to all earth stations in the network. A complete list of terminals participating in operations with INTELSAT III satellites, as of January 1971, together with present operating status, is provided in Table 10-6. Multiple access communications nets have been formed among appropriate groups of these terminals to operate with INTELSAT satellites located over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Fourth generation earth terminals have been constructed to operate with the new INTELSAT IV satellites. These terminals provide a large number of carriers to take advantage of the multiplicity of satellite transponders that have become available. As a result, the requirements for linearity in common RFtransmitting and receiving elements within these ground terminals have been substantially increased. Additions to the ground complex defined in Table 10-8 that should be operational by the end of 1974 and those projected up to 1978 are listed in Table 10-9, 10-10, and 10-11. INTELSAT IV satellites have assumed responsibility for space segment operations over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These satellites and new signal proc­ essing techniques allow both fixed"}
