Molniya-1 Communications Satellite (Cutaway View) ORIGMAC PAGj 1 11-11 OF Poop of a radiator-condenser (in a cylindrical configuration about the spacecraft body) and a heat panel (in the form of a flat ring). The multi-stage launch vehicle, designated A-2-e, provides the necessary service for the satellite from lift off to space orbit. The A-2-e is approximately 42.8 meters (140.5 feet) tall. The first stage consists of the basic Vostok central core plus four tapered strap-on boosters with a total thrust of 4,999,800 newtons (1,124,000 pounds). The combined second and third stage thrust is 1,374,500 new­ tons (309,000 pounds) for a combined total thrust of 6,374,300 newtons (1,433, 000 pounds). When the spacecraft attains its final orbit and has separated from the last stage of the launch vehicle, the solar cell panels, originally folded along the body of the satellite, are automatically extended. The orientation system is switched on, the satellite's tumbling motion is arrested by gas-jets, and the body of the satellite to­ gether with the solar cell panels is oriented"}
