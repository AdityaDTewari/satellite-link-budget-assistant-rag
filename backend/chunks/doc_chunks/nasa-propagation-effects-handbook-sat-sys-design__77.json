The parameter R,which indicates howwell thedata fits theanalytical curve (R2=1forperfect fit), isgiven foreach case. Thebest-fit _and values arequite variable month-to-month, andsome months have very lowR2 values. TheLITdata gave similar results. This indicates that theformula is probably notvery reliable forpredicting XPDversus CPAonaninstananeous basis. Statistical plots, ontheother hand, generally show very good fitto theformula.

Thetheoretical predictions ingeneral overestimatethedepolarizing effects oftherain. IntheBTLexperiment, co-andcrosspolarized signal phase aswell as amplitude wasmeasured. This allowed theinvestigators tocalculate XPDfor arbitrary polarization states byvector manipulations. Thebeacon signal used, from aCOMSTAR satellite, waslinear polarized andoriented atabout 210from thelocal horizontal. Through thedata conversion process, XPD versus CPAwasdeterminedonastatisticalbasis forlinear polarization oriented0°,45°and900from horizontal, andRHCP. Figure 4.3-5 shows themedian 19GHzcurves forthetrue polarizations (21°from vertical and horizontal) andforvertical, horizontal and45°.Theexperiment confirmed thetheoretical result that maximum XPDoccursat45°.Also, theXPDvalues calculated forRHCP were virtually identical tothose at45°,which is predicted bytheory. Thefigure showsthat the210curves fall between the 450andthevertical/horizontal curves, andthat XPDforhorizontal polarization isgreater than forvertical polarization. Both ofthese results aqree with physical reasoning. Ageneral agreement with theXPD=_-_log CPArelation isevident forthelowerthree curves, inthat they tendtolie nearastraight line onthesemilogarithmic plot.
