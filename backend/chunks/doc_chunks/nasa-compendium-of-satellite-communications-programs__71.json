About 21 dB.( 3 )Holmdel Receive Margin Notes: (1) Frequency modulation was normally used. (2) In normal 60-MHz RF bandwidth, threshold occurs at 3-dB C/N. (3) High margin allows successful operation in spite of significant signal fluctuations. Also allows good quality communications employing modulation techniques with considerably less processing gain than FM. 3.3 SPACECRAFT Echo I was a hollow sphere constructed from gores of 0. 0013-cm (0.0005-inch) thick Mylar with the external surfaces coated with vapor-deposited aluminum to pro­ vide efficient radio-wave reflectivity. I( 1 ) In this design, long cigar-shaped pieces are cut out of sheet material and joined together with \"butt\" seams. Where the \"gores\" come together at the two poles of the structure, a reinforcing \"pole cap\" was used. The sphere was designed to have a 30.5-meter (100-foot) diameter when inflated and weighed approximately 61.2 kilograms (135 pounds). (3) 3-10 Before launch, the satellite was evacuated and accordion-pleat folded for pack­ ing in the spherical launch container. The launch container, measuring 66 centi­ meters (26 inches) in diameter, was also evacuated to a rather low vacuum prior to launch. When the container was placed in orbit, it was explosively separated at its equator and the satellite was initially inflated by the small amount of residual air en­ trapped within its interior. ( 1 6) Inflation was completed and the shape of the inflated satellite was temporarily maintained by the small gas pressure created by sublimating solids (i.e., 9.1 kilograms (20 pounds) of anthraquinone"}
