As a result of extensive studies on the orbital properties of the dipole belt, it was determined that the major influence on the perigee height would be solar radiation pressure. The effect of the solar, radiation pressure would be to drive down the perigee height until the orbit pierced the dense portions of the earth's atmosphere where air drag would exert an additional force to drive down the perigee height still further until the orbit intersected -theearth's surface. From an extrapolatioft of the time behavior of fhe-physical cross-section of the actual belt, it was concluded that 25'percent of the individually orbiting dipoles would cease to orbit after about 2-1/2 years, 50 percent after 3 years, and 100 percent after 5 years. Thus it was expected that the orbits of all separated dipoles would decay by early 1968. 5-7 5.4 'GROUND STATIONS Two ground stations were constructed,, one in Massachusetts (at Millstone Hill in West Ford) and one in California (at Camp Parks in Pleasanton) to use the dipole belt. and to measure its characteristics. The ground stations can transmit and receive CW X-band communications.signals simultaneously. In addition, each station ­ can be changed within minutes to a radar capable of tracking and measuring the characteristics of the dipole belt and other satellites. The characteristics of the ground stations are presented in Table 5-2. 5.5 EXPERIMENTS Two broad investigative programs were- established for determining the feasibility of using the orbital dipole belt as a medium for global 6ommunications. The first was a measurements program for estimating the belt orbit parameters, ovei an extended period of time, studying diso-ersion of the belt with time, deter­ mining the variatioi'bfdipole density along the orbit"}
