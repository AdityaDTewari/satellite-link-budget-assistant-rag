ITU-R P.618 -14 G = Gd · Gf · G · G dB (41) 2.2.5 Characteristics of precipitation events 2.2.5.1 Durations of individual fades The durations of rain fades that exceed a specified attenuation level are approximately log -normally distributed. Median durations are of the order of several minutes. No significant dependence of these distributions on fade depth is evident in most measur ements for fades of less than 20 dB, implying that the larger total time percentage of fades observed at lower fade levels or at higher frequencies is composed of a larger number of individual fades having more or less the same distribution of durations. S ignificant departures from log -normal seem to occur for fade durations of less than about half a minute. Fade durations at a specified fade level tend to increase with decreasing elevation angle. For the planning of integrated services digital network (ISDN) connections via satellite, data are needed on the contribution of attenuation events shorter than 10 s to the total fading time. This information is especially relevant for the attenuation leve l corresponding to the outage threshold, where events longer than 10 s contribute to system unavailable time, while shorter events affect system performance during available time (see Recommendation ITU -R S.579). Existing data indicate that in the majority of cases, the exceedance time during available time is 2% to 10% of the net exceedance time. However, at low elevation angles where the short period signal fluctuations due to tropospheric scintillation become statistically significant, there are some cas es for which the exceedance time during available time is far larger"}
