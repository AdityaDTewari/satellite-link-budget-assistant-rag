RESF_'_ &TEQ'_NGLGGV mC 3.3 Antenna Contributions Foranarrow beam antenna pointed above thehorizon, asource of noise contributing totheantenna temperature TA,additional tothat discussed inSection 3.Iand 3.2) isdue tosidelobe contributions. This noise canbesignificant since theground provides arelatively high temperature source. The effectoftheintegrated sidelobe contri- bution isareduction inthemain-beamefficiency for antennas that have relatively high sidelobe levels. Shielding toreduce theemission from nearby ground surfaces canimprove the performance. For lowelevation angles (near thehorizon) thenoise contribution from the ground andhorizon temperatures may beparticularly significant with the antenna temperature approaching thatofthesurface (To). Themodel forantenna temperature increase versus decreasing elevation angle depends both onthespecific antenna design (and near side lobe antenna pattern structure) andthe particular terrain features inthe vicinity theantenna faces near thehorizon. These design considerations arealso beyond the scope oftreatment here. 75 CONCLUSION Thisreport covers onlythepropagation pathlossandnoise considerations forearth-to-space communication links operating at frequencies from1to300GHz.
