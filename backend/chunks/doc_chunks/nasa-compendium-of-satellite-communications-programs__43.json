Additionally, weight and prime power consumption were competitive with or superior to that realized by other approaches. Gravity gradient stabilization was of interest because of the potentially high reliabilities available from such a passive system. Launches of medium and syn­ chronous altitude ATS spacecraft, designed for this type of stabilization, were attempted in early 1967 and late 1968, respectively. Additionally, special hear synchronous test satellites, included as part of the IDCSP program, were launched in mid-1966 and mid-1967. The ATS evaluations could not be conducted due to launch vehicle failures. The IDCSP tests demonstrated a limited degree of success in initially establishing and maintaining gravity gradient stabilization, but numerous unexplained difficulties were encountered. As a result, by late 1968, the jury was still out on gravity gradient stabilization, but the initial findings were not favorable. The mid-1966 to late 1968 time period also saw considerable experimentation, at VHF and the lower UHF frequencies, with providing communications to small mobile or remote terminals or both.. The existence of extensive conventional small terminal facilities was the primary driving force behind the initial interest in this frequency 1-19 band. A preliminary evaluation of propagation characteristics had been carried out with the aid of a simple UHF beacon radiating satellite launched as part of the LES program in late 1965. Additionally, a few simple demonstrations had been conducted, using the telemetry and command system on a Syncom satellite. More extensive experiments were made possible with the inclusion of a VHF transponder on the first spin-stabilized ATS spacecraft launched in late 1966. These experiments were extended further when a UHF LES satellite was launched in mid­ 1967, and the second spin-stabilized ATS spacecraft, also including a VHF"}
