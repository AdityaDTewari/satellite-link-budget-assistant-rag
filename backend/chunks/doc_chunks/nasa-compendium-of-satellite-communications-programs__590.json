Such a configuration provides the figure of merit necessary for TV reception from the CTS. The antenna system will include both a dish and control mechanism. To keep the cost as low as possible the antenna mount will be of a type where the initial set-up is easily accomplished. A few experimenters are expected to have tracking mechanisms. Properties of the proposed Canadian terminals are given in Table 19-3, which also gives characteristics of the CTS antenna in Ottawa. 19.4 EXPERIMENTS Under the CTS agreement the United States and Canada share the experiment time on an equal basis. Each country's tentative program is described in Table 19-4. In general, the-experiments are in two classes; technical and social. The technical experiments are to evaluate the performance of the spacecraft and ground stations while the social experiments are to test the usefulness of a satellite communications network in solving social problems. 19-15 / Terminal Control (Ottawa) CD TV remoteQ transmission TV receive only and two-way voice Two-way voice and/or FM sound broadcast receive Diam 9.1 m (30 ft) 3.0 m (10 ft) 2 m (8 ft) 1 M (3 ft) Table 19-3.
