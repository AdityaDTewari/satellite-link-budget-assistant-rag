Two antenna systems located on the EVM are used for this experiment. One of the antennas is a narrow-beam unit which will be used to di­ rect wide band signals such as TV to specific 'locations. The other is a horn antenna designed to cover the U. S. and Canada for multistation participation. The primary ground station for this experiment is located at the ATS ground station near Rbsman, N. C. It consists of a 4.6-meter (15-foot) -diameter parabolic reflector coupled to low noise receivers tuned to 20 and 30 GHz frequencies. Also included are weather radars, radiometers, rain gauges, and other meteorological equipment to monitor the weather conditions at the site. Other ground stationsare presently planned for the following locations: Austin, Texas--University of Texas Blacksburg, Va. --Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Clarksburg,"}
