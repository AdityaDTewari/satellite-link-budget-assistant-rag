Therefore, the power density diminishes. Figure from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_square 3 Free Space Loss at 2.4 GHz ‣Using decibels to express the loss and using 2.4 GHz as the signal frequency, the equation for the Free Space Loss is: Lfs = 100 + 20*log10(d) ‣ ...where Lfs is expressed in dB and d is in kilometers. 4 Free Space Loss (any frequency) ‣Using decibels to express the loss and at a generic frequency f, the equation for the Free Space Loss is: Lfs = 92,45 + 20*log(d) + 20*log(f) ‣ ...where Lfs is expressed in dB, d is in kilometers and f is in GHz. 5 6 Free Space Loss Versus distance for different bands } TVWS } WiFi Power in a wireless system 7 Analogy money in a journey 8 $ Initial purse Taxi fare ATM withdrawal Meals and drinks payment on the road ATM withdrawal Taxi fare Remaining Cash Margin Expenses Link budget ‣Link budget is a way of quantifying the link performance. ‣The received power in a n wireless link is determined by three factors: transmit power , transmitting antenna gain , and receiving antenna gain. ‣If that power, minus the free space loss of the link path, is greater than the minimum received signal level of the"}
