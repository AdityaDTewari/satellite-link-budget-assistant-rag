The trans­ mitting system included a primary and secondary transmitter operating at the same frequency. Additionally, a capability existed to receive and detect a TV signal to be used to modulate the L-Band satellite transmitter. (35) However, the spinning condi­ tion of ATS-5 precluded transmissions of TV signals. The spacecraft millimeter wave receiver utilized a balanced mixer front end with a 17 dB maximum noise figure working into a 1. 05 GHz solid state IF amplifier having a 47.5 dB gain. (34) Maximum received signal level was -85 dBm and mini­ mum sensitivity was -120 dBm. The receiver phase locked on the carrier with the aid of a track-and-search circuit providing a + 5 kHz minimum pull in range over a +320 kHz band. The solid state primary millimeter wave transmitter supplied 250 mW (unmodulated) and 70 mW per line (modulated) of downlink power. The secondary transmitter was identical but could not be modulated by a tone. Figure M3-1. Lnd A2- R F M I 2c -B 1555. MHO IF VCOFTR' Fiur2 -5 10.
