User/TDRS Line-of-Sight Geometry 3-6 If L is allowed to represent the line-of-sight direction from the user to the TDRS, then L =R -r, and, since the user's antenna for Case 1 (no gimballing) is assumed to point outwards along the satellite radius vector, visibility exists if < cosa IL 2 3 where e = user antenna beamwidth For Case 2 (t 900 gimballing) two conditions must be met for communi- cations to be possible. First, the line-of-sight vector l must be within 900 of the radius vector (see Figure 3.3), i.e., the following must hold: r * L> 0. Secondly, allowing movement of the antenna through f900 about an axis parallel to the orbitnormal and letting the unit vector T represent the antenna pointing direction anywhere along the 1800 sweep, in order for visibility to exist, the following condition must hold: 7 q- cos For Case 3 (t gimballing), the conditions that must be met are the same as for Case 2 except that the first inequality is replaced by r • L a L cos 0 3-7 Figure 3.4.
