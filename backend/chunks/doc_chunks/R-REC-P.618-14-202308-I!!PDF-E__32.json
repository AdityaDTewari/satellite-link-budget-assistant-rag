These equations were developed from data in the frequency range 6 -38 GHz and elevation angles in the range from 1° to 4°. They are expected to be valid at least in the frequency range from 1 to 45 GHz and elevation angles in the range from 0.5° to 5°. 2.4.3 Calculation of the shallow fading part of the scintillation/multipath fading distribution at elevation angles less than 5° The shallow fading model in this section is developed for scintillation fading in the transition region for fading less than 25 dB and free -space elevation angles less than 5 °.
