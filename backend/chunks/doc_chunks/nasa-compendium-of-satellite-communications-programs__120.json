Power balancing was accomplished manually by coordinating between terminals.. Margins provided had to account for variations in satellite antenna gain as a function of satellite aspect angle to the terminal and rain losses as well as various miscel­ laneous losses. 6-4 Table 6-5.

(12-15) The communicatfions repeater in both satellites was as illustrated in Figure 6-1. The basic repeater design reflects the desire to employ established technology to ensure reliability. Most of the repeater is in broad principle similar to equipment used earlier in land-based microwave systems. Storage batteries and a capability to command equipment \"on\" and \"off\" allowed utilizing a solar array too small to meet real-time power demands but within.weight limitations. Spin stabilizing relative to the sun reduced temperature equalization and solar array illumination problems. However, it made the selection of an essentially omnidirectional antenna necessary. f r ft 6389.58 MHz 4169.72 MHz NOTE: CIRCLED NUMBERS SHOW f POWER LEVELS IN DOM a 4079.73 MHz AGC MOITOR-\" ft EA T RAV ELIN G -R C ON VEREIRIE MPLIFIER API AMPLIFIER i L IF AMPLIFIER I../@ GI 9000:1:25 mHz6299.58 MHz BAND"}
