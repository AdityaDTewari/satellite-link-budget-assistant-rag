Block Misdelivery Probability Themain causes forblock misdelivery intheACTS LBRsystem areerrors in thedestination address information orswitch control commands.These would be undetected errors inthedestination address field oftheoriginating station's inbound order wire orerrors inthecontrol link from theMCStotheBBP's DRP.

Because ofthis andthedifficulty ofcollecting enough data tocalculate the probability with ahigh degree ofreliability, the Block Misdelivery Probability isnot included inthe set ofACTS LBR system performance parameters. Block Loss Probability The primary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probability would be misrouted orlost blocks. Block loss would bepossible during deep transmission link fades. Since theACTS LBRsystem does notuseanyform of ARQ protocol, blocks transmitted during adeep fade would be lost. Additionally, iftheusers areusing anARQprotocol andatransmission error causes aNAKtobechanged toanACK, anyblocks requiring retransmission would belost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware andsoftware \"crashes\" where thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. TheBlock Loss Probability fortheACTS LBRsystem isexpected tobelow, with themain cause being transmission fades. Block Loss Probability isan easy parameter tomeasure and therefore isincluded inthe set ofACTS LBR system performance parameters. Extra Block Probability Because theACTS LBR system isconnection oriented anddoes notuse any form ofARQprotocol, there islittle chance forextra blocks tobegenerated bythesystem. Oneprobable case, however, would beiftheBBP's output memory was read twice before being overwritten with newdata.
