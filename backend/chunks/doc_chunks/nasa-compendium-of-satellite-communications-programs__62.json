The IGY balloon satellite had been conceived and designed primarily for air density experiments. NASA took charge of this activity and reformulated it as Project Echo in late 1958. as indicated in Table 3-1. (1)(2)'Major objectives for the Echo program were Table 3-1. Echo Program Objectives Number Description 1 To evaluate the communications capability available from large spherical passive satellite reflectors. 2 To study the feasibility of erecting and maintaining large lightweight structures in the space environ­ ment. 3 To gather data on solar pressure and the outer limits of the earth's atmosphere as well as evaluating their effects on satellite orbits. Of three attempts to orbit passive reflecting balloons during this program, two of these efforts were successful. The launches and satellite status are reviewed in (1)(3)(4)Table 3-2. Prior to the initial Echo launch, extensive ground, vacuum chamber, and space ballistic tests were conducted. (1)(2)(5) The ground tests employed prototype spheres. to confirm sphericity and structural integrity of basic balloon design. The vacuum chamber tests evaluated balloon release from its containing canister, unfolding, and inflation during free fall at NASA's Langley Research Center. The balloon deployment system 'was refined and space-qualified during"}
