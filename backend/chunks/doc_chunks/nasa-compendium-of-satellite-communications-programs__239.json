The resulting bit error rate is - better than 1 x 108 at the 48/50 kbps rate using standard SPADE channel power and bandwidth, and several of these channels are presently in service. 10.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Transatlantic communications via Early Bird were nominally effected through the Andover, Maine, earth station and one of four European earth stations. A Canadian station at Mill Village, Nova Scotia, also served as the North American terminal about 1 day per week after late 1966. In addition, it carried Early Bird traffic during the INTELSAT II launches to release the Andover station for launch sup­ port operations. Three of the European stations, located at Goonhilly Downs (England), Pleumeur Bodou (France), and Raisting (Germany), served alternately in the roles of operating station and standby. They were interconnected by terrestrial and submarine cable links that permitted all European traffic'to be carried by any one of the stations. The fourth smaller participating European terminal, located at Fucino (Italy), acted as a terminal for weekend traffic. It was linked to the other three terminals via Frankfrt, Germany. The terminals participating in Early Bird operations are sum­ marized in Table 10-6. The development of INTELSAT II with a bandwidth several times that of Early Bird was accompanied by second generation earth station designs such as those for the Brewster Flats, Washington, and Paumalu, Hawaii, installations. The terminals, in addition to those indicated in Table 10-6, participating in operations with INTELSAT II satellites, as of April 1968, are listed in Table 10-7. INTELSAT II satellites located over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans provided multiple-access communications among"}
