This chapter isarranged ineight relatively independent sections covering thekeytopics related totheinteraction ofthetroposphere and earth-space propagation paths. Each section presents adescriptionofthe effect(s)andanexample calculation related toatypical communication system. Because these examples provide aconcise guide tothecalculations required, anindex totheexamples isgiven inTable 6.1-1. 6.1.3Frequency Bands forEarth-Space Communication Within theguidelines established bytheInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) forRegion 2(includes U.S. andCanada), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intheU.S. andtheDepartment of Communications (DOC) inCanada regulate theearth-space frequency allocations. Inmost cases, theFCCandDOCregulations aremore restrictive than theITU regulations. Therefore, theFCCandDOCearth-space frequency bands are considered inthis report.i t• 196 Table 6.1-1.

Thedefinitions ofeach ofthese services aregiven intheRadio Regulations. Thespecific frequency allocations forthese services are relatively fixed. However, some modifications canbeexpected atthe1979 World Administrative Radio Conference based ontherecommendations oftheFCC, w DOCandothers. Areview oftheRadio Regulations indicates thatmost ofthe frequency spectr_, above 10GHzisassigned tothesatellite services orthe radioastronomy service. This does notmean that theFCCandDOCwill utilize them, butitdoes highlight thepotential foruseofthese frequency bands.
