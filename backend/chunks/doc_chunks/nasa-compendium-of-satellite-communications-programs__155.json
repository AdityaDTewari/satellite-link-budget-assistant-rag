Characteristics of these terminals are presented in Table 8-6. (3) (6) (9) (11) (14) (15) Major subsystems of the ground facilities placed aboard the Kingsport are shown in Figure 8-3. (3) The AN/FSC-9 and AN/MSC-44 terminal installations did not, in general, include the TT&C antenna and system. The transmit and receive polarizations available at the AN/MSC-44 and Kingsport terminals were compatible with those of the Syncom sattellites. In contrast, the receive polarization of the AN/FSC-9 terminals was such that a S-dB polarization loss was suffered. By choosing circular polarization, however, it was no longer necessary to track variations in the linear polarization received from the satellite. The AN/FSC-9 and AN/MSC-44 terminals employed two axis (i. e., azimuth and elevation) tracking and control of the antenna. The Kingsport terminal was provided with a three-axis antenna, however, to ensure a capability for near zenith operation from the rolling and pitching ship. 8.5 EXPERIMENTS Experiments conducted on project Syncom are grouped in five major categories and defined in Table 8-7. Synchronous orbit injection was successfully completed on Syncoms I, Hl and IlI. In the latter case, a synchronous equatorial orbit was realized. Spacecraft stationkeeping and attitude control were sticcessfully maintained on Syncoms I1and IIl. In the process- of stationkeeping, considerable data on the triaxial nature of the earth and the drift of synchronous satellites was generated. (16) (17) (18) 8-9 Table 8-6.
