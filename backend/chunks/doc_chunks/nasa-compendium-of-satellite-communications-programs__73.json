The gores terminated at the polar areas of the sphere where 137-centimeter (54-inch) diameter pole caps were attached, using a 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) overlapping joint. The material used was a 3-layer sandwich of. 00051-centimeter (. 00020-inch) sheets of aluminium on each side of a *00091-centimeter (. 00036-inch) mylar polyester film. The total skin thickness was 3-11 .00191 centimeter (. 00075 inch), which was only 50 percent greater than that of Echo I but it produced a rigidity about 100 times greater. This construction resulted in an inflated sphere measuring 41. 1 meters (135 feet) in diameter and weighing 250 kilograms (550 pounds). The structure was folded and packed inside a launch canister having an elliptical vertical cross section and a circular horizontal cross section as mounted for launch­ ing. (6) The canister had a 76-centimeter (30-inch) vertical diameter and a 112-centi­ meter (44-inch) horizontal diameter. The container, as well as the satellite, was evacuated to prevent excessively rapid inflation by expansion of residual air inside. The canister was separated in orbit in the same manner as for Echo I and residual air again provided the initial inflation. However, continued inflation and full pressurization were accomplished in a much more controlled manner. In this system, the inflatant, now pyrozole, was sealed in numerous small packets that were attached to the inside surface of the satellite. ( 1 ) The packet§ were sealed with an adhesive wax that melted just below the equilibrium temperature of the sphere in orbit. The bags, therefore, were not opened to start sublimation and the buildup to higher pressurization until the sun's energy elevated the temperature of the satellite. This occurred long after initial inflation"}
