The first, in an expected series of eight satellites, was successfully launched by an Atlas Centaur rocket into a geostationary orbit on January 25, 1971. It was positioned over the Atlantic at 335.5 0 E longitude. Subsequent INTELSAT IVs were launched for service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans with an additional two satellites as spares in or­ bit. Each satellite has a life expectancy of about 7 years. Table 10-4 summarizes the INTELSAT IV launchings up to June 1974. Two INTELSAT IV satellites are therefore operational over the Atlantic. One of these, as the \"primary path, \"handles one-half of the traffic between large users plus all of the traffic to, from, and betweei the smaller users. The other satellite operates in a \"major path\" mode to carry the remaining half of the traffic between large users, thus providing route diversity. The first INTELSAT IV launched is now in reserve over the Atlantic, making a full complement of three in this heavy traffic 10-7 Table 10-4.
