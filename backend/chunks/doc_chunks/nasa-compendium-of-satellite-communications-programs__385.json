Fig­ ure 13-14 details the communications package located in the Earth Viewing Module (EVM). Spacecraft characteristics are summarized in Tables 13-29 through 13-31. (39) Note that the earth viewing horns, the radio beacon antenna, the interferometer horns, and the VHF antennas are not listed on Table 13-31. 13.4.3 ATS-6 Communications Equipment The communications subsystem for the ATS-6 satellite consists of a composite antenna feed and the most complex transponder ever developed for use in space. It was designed and built for Fairchild Space and Electronics Company by Philco-Ford Corporation's Western Development Laboratories Division in Palo Alto, California. The communications system will operate over an unusually broad range of UHF, VHF, L-band, S-band and C-band frequencies--about 17 in all, ranging from 136 MHz to 6 GHz. The system also provides monopulse signals which are used by the space­ * craft for attitude stabilization. The system receives up to three signals simultane­ ously and can transmit one or a combination of these on any of the assigned frequencies. 13-59 12 FEET) SOLAR PANELMNT o 9ENVROMENTAR( Ll REFLECTO ANTENNA V\"F ffaFLEETRY ON FESM TIt conuwlcyamuomaaFl EARTh VIEWNG M OUt1iLEL lREFRLECTfO mOULE Figure 13-13.
