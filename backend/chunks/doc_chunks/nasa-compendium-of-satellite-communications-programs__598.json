American Satellite Corporation 2. American Telephone and Telegraph/Comsat General Corporation/GTE Satel­ lite Corporation 3. Radio Corporation of America 4. Western Union Each Domsat description includes (1) program description, (2) system description, (3) spacecraft, (4) ground terminals, and (5) operational results. The information on these Domsat systems is based mainly on applications before the Federal Communications Commissi6n (FCC) and may become out of date as the sys­ tems become operational. -The data on earth terminals especially may change as the systems progress. The FCC applications are listed as References 1 through 6. 20-1 20.2 AMERICAN SATELLITE CORPORATION (ASC) 20.2.1 Program Description ASC's program is planned to evolve in three phases. The first phase involves the leasing of up to three satellite channels from Telesat Canada or Western U'nion and the construction of four earth terminals. The second phase includes the procurement and launch of at least two Hughes-built 12-channel satellites and the addition of eight earth terminals. The third phase includes plans to utilize 24-channel satellites. Phase I can be of considerable duration. 20.2.2 System Description ASC leases radio frequency (RF) transponder channels on the Western Union Westar satellite. The earth segment is provided by ASC. Earth terminal locations near New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas are planned or exist. Additional terminals are to be placed to serve certain military bases such as Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska. 20.2.3 Spacecraft The Westar satellite, used in the ASC Domsat system, is described in Section 20.5.3. 20.2.4 Ground Terminals An ASC ground terminal includes a 10. 1-meter (33-1/3-foot) diameter antenna"}
