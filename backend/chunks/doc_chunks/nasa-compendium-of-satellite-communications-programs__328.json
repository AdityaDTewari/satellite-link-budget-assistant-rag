By consolidating multiple experi­ ments into a single program,. NASA realized significant cost reductions and structured a program that was directly responsive to the responsibilities assigned NASA under the Space Act of 1958 and the Satellite Act of 1962. The ATS program, as initially conceived and approved by Congress, was, a multiyear project involving five unique satellites launched into space to conduct some. 20 major experiments and a number of related data-gathering studies. Major objec­ tives of the five flights were to: (1) investigate technology common to a numbei'of space applications; (2) investigate technology for the synchronous orbit; (3) develop spacecraft stabilization techniques; and (4) develop experiments for several satellite applications. The underlying design philosophy, in developing these satellites, was to provide a large and adaptable volume for mounting the various experiment payloads while employing basic satellite configurations appropriate for either spin or gravity­ gradient ,stabilization. Two satellites were designed in the spin stabilized configu­ ration and three were gravity gradient stabilized. Two subconfigurations existed for the gravity gradient stabilized satellites. The first of the three satellites employing this stabilization technique was designed for a medium altitude circular 13-1 orbit where no stationkeeping was necessary. The two subsequent spacecraft were configured for operation in synchronous equatorial orbits. Each of the five satellites contained a separate complement of experiments with a relatively low level of experiment repetition from spacecraft to spacecraft. (2) The, exception to the latter was the C-Band communications experiments. All five satellites included identical C-Band repeaters for conducting these experiments. As development and launching of the initial five satellites proceeded, and NASA began to look towards the future, the main thrust of the ATS program objectives became more exclusively communications oriented. NASA's ATS research effort is now directed towards advanced techniques for bringing satellite"}
