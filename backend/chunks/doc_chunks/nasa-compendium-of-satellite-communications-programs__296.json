Moreover, a receiver monitor, video monitor, and received signal level recorder are included as parts of the receiving units. The parametric amplifiers of the re­ ceivers are two-stage regenerative amplifier-converters. In the Molniya-1 system, the two-stage parametric amplifiers operate at both normal and liquid nitrogen tem­ peratures. The noise temperature of the uncooled parametric amplifier is 1500 K, and of the cooled is 80°K. The cooled parametric amplifier is installed ahead of an Isolating filter. The frequency passband is sufficient for quality transmission of black and white or color television. For transmission of group spectra, frequency feedback reduces the passband to 1.5 to 2.0 MHz. The Orbita earth terminals, Figure 11-8, are built according to a standard plan and include a circular, concrete building which serves at the same time as the pedestal for the antenna. This places the antenna well above any local obstruction. The an­ tenna is not protected by a radome; however, it is designed to operate between tem­ peratures of 273.15°K ±50'K and in wind velocities approaching 96 kmph (60 mph). It is made of aluminum alloy and weighs approximately 4990 kilograms (5-1/2 tons). The total weight of the entire antenna, support, and its various mechanisms is about 45,000 kilograms (50 tons). The central room in the building under the antenna houses various receiving equipment, the parametric amplifier, etc. Around this room are located offices and the additional services including air conditioning. The arrangements are sketched in Figures 11-9 and 11-10. As of mid-1971, there were approximately 50 Orbita-1 earth terminals. Some of the known Orbita-1 site locations are listed in Table 11-4. More recently, Orbita-2 earth terminals have been installed for operation"}
