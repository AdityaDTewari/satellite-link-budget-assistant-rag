Typically, the maximum gaseous attenuation occurs during the season of maximum ra infall (see Recommendation ITU-R P.836). 2.2 Attenuation by precipitation and clouds 2.2.1 Prediction of attenuation statistics for an average year The general method to predict attenuation due to precipitation and clouds along a slant propagation path is presented in § 2.2.1.1. The method to predict the probability of non -zero rain attenuation along a slant path is described in § 2.2.1.2. If reliable long -term statistical attenuation data are available that were measured at an elevation angle and a frequency (or frequencies) different from those for which a prediction is needed, it is often preferable to scale these data to the elevation an gle and frequency in question rather than using the general method. The recommended frequency -scaling method is found in § 2.2.1.3. Site diversity effects may be estimated with the method of § 2.2.4. 2.2.1.1 Calculation of long -term rain attenuation statistics from point rainfall rate The following procedure provides estimates of the long -term statistics of the slant -path rain attenuation at a given location for frequencies up to 55 GHz. The following parameters are required: R0.01 : point rainfall rate for the location for 0.01% of an average year (mm/h) hs : height above mean sea level of the earth station (km)  : elevation angle (degrees)  : latitude of the earth station (degrees) f : frequency (GHz) Re : effective radius of the Earth (8 500 km). If local data for the earth station height above mean sea level is not available, an estimate can be obtained from the maps of topographic altitude given in Recommendation ITU -R P.1511. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 7 FIGURE 1 Schematic"}
