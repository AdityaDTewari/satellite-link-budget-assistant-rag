Here the wavelengths are relatively small and consequently insignificant structural difficulties arise. In Table 4.1, these antennas have been classified according to back radiation, weight, interaction with the spacecraft, stowage and deployment requirements and polarization characteristics. 4-14 4.2.5 Multiple Wavelength Antennas Multiple wavelength antennas can consist of continuous apertures or arrays of discrete elements. They are normally medium or high gain and radiate a pencil beam, fan beams or other special beam shapes. Continuous apertures include horns, parabolic and spherical reflectors, corner reflectors and lenses. They have the advantage of small interaction with the spacecraft and low back and sidelobes. They have the disadvantages of greater weight, usually require stowage and deployment and require mechanical steerability at the lower frequencies. Array antennas consists of discrete radiators, either directly or parasitically exited. By varying the phase and amplitude of the fed radiating elements, these arrays can radiate anywhere from normal to the array (broadside) to parallel to it (endfire). Endfire arrays, although physically small in the plane orthogonal to the direction of maximum radiation, suffer from the fact that the gain increases only as t the square root of the length. Array type antenna have the advantage of small interaction with the spacecraft, and electronic steerability in some cases.* For all of the configurations summarized in Section 4.4, the S-band designs pose fewer structural problems which allows for greater flexibility in the electrical design. Table 4.2 categorizes these antennas according to back radiation, weight, interaction with spacecraft, polarization and stowage and development characteristics. *In all array designs the interaction between the spacecraft structure and the overall pattern is to a significant extent dependent upon the gainof the individual array elements themselves. 4-15 4.2.6 Antenna Switching Two or more half wavelength antennas which have reduced coverage and lower"}
