The manufacturer and sponsor of the Titan IC launch vehicles was Martin Marietta, DOD/DCA/SAMSO. 12.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Eight of the initial 26 satellites were still operational as of May 1974. The satellites, as viewed from the earth, drift from west to east at about 300 longitude per day. A single satellite stays within view of a particular earth terminal about 4-1/2 days. A varying distribution of satellites encircling the earth exists, since each satellite was released from the dispenser at a slightly different orbital velocity. The differential velocities are arranged to reduce \"bunching\" of satellites, thus en­ hancing satellite availability. Originally designed for a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 1.5 years (with a goal of 3 years), the satellites have exceeded this goal. (9) The satellite transmitters were designed to turn off automatically 6 to 6-1/2 years from the date of launch but all of the automatic turn-off devices failed to operate leaving some of the satellites operational beyond that time interval. 12-3 There were three types of terminals used in the DSCS Phase I (see Table 12-3). Two AN/FSC-9 terminals were used -one located at Camp Roberts, California, and the other at Fort Dix, New Jersey. They were fixed installations, each equipped with 18-meter (60-foot) diameter antenna. The AN/MSC-46 earth terminals developed for DSCS Phase I are transportable units with 12-meter (40-foot) diameter antennas. The highly transportable AN/TSC-54 terminals were used for extension of the DCS into contingency areas, for tributary-type links to outlying activities, and as Navy shore stations. Local conditions dictate the type of transmission facility used as an interconnect link. Table 12-3. Participating"}
