The database of all commercialpayload components contains pictures of each component, leading to a larger sized database, so an Excelspreadsheet database is not the best implementation for this program. Microsoft Access was also a strongconsideration as a database since NASA uses Microsoft products, but the open-source MySQL was chosensince it could store images. This program could be implemented with an Access database for wider usewithin NASA, but MySQL allows any person to be able to use this program easily. The programs were designed to be modular - so that future developers would be able to remove and/or insert modules and classes as needed. 2This is more practical for the payload design tool because in the future new components will be designed for problems that have not yet been realized. The modularityof the program will allow these components to be easily added. The link budget calculator can also bereprogrammed to allow for greater precision in its various calculations, without rewriting major portions ofits codebase. 3o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics III. Design Implementation Stepping through the process, for the Communication Payload Design Tool, there were several interfaces that needed to be created: main interface, inputting component details, and generating the report form.The main interface is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Main interface of Communication Payload Design Tool The left panel allows the user to create the components onto the white design area on the right. Generic components can be picked on the communication payload design tool and arranged in the certain conﬁgura-tion. As each component is added to the design area, the user can pick from a list of commercially available components from a database that the database automatically retrieves as shown in Figure 4.
