Telesat is owned jointly by the Canadian government, Canadian telecommunications common carriers, and the public. The Telesat communications satellites were manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company and initial earth terminals were manufactured by Canadian companies. The importance of Telesat can be understood when it is realized that hundreds of small towns, hamlets and clusters of isolated communities in northern areas have very limited communications. Some areas have depended on high-frequency radio links for contact with government, business and neighbors in other northern areas and with the larger cities in southern parts of Canada. The Canadian microwave system provides interconnecting links but is concentrated primarily near the United States-Canadian border. Extending this system to the isolated areas would be very costly, and practi­ cally impossible in some parts of the northern regions. The extension of television and communications into the northern two-thirds of the country will pave the way for settlement and resources development. Telesat's major initial customers are the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Trans-Canada Telephone System, and the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways, which operate extensive communica­ tions systems. Telesat, unlike the U. S. Communications Satellite Corporation, is authorized to sell to any bulk customer the equivalent of one television channel or more. The first Telesat satellite was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy by a new Delta launch vehicle on November 9, 1972. This satellite was named ANIK which is the 18-1 Eskimo word for \"brother. \" 4NIK I (Figure 18-1) was placed into synchronous orbit­ 42,596 kilometers (23, 000 nautical miles) above the equator and was positioned at 1140 W longitude. It was first used for commercial service on January 11, 1973, pro­ viding coverage throughout Canada as illustrated in Figure 18-2. A second satellite, ANIK H, was launched on April 26, 1973,"}
