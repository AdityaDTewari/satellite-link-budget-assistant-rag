When theMCSreceives thecircuit disconnect request, itchecks theactive $ circuit file for the circuit identified. Ifthe circuit islisted, the disconnect message isvalid andtheMCSproceeds with thedisconnectprocess. The MCS sends adisconnect acknowledgment message toboth earth stations carrying the circuit, instructing them todisconnectthe circuit. Ifthe circuit listed inthe circuitdisconnectmessage isnot intheMCS active circuitf_le, themessage isdiscarded. IftheMCSneeds theTDMA frame space toaccommodate newcircuit requests, itwill develop anddistribute anewBTP. Ifitdoes not need the frame space freed bythedisconnect request, the current BTPisnotchanged. Large trunk circuits are established bymaking multiple requests for 64kb/s circuits. Each request contains thesame circuitconnectparameters buthas aunique circuit identification number. The trunk isnot available until all the circuit assignments have been received and implemented. A similar procedure applies todisconnecting thetrunk. Disconnect requests for each 64kb/s circuit comprising thetrunk isprocessed separately. Broadcast connections aresimilarly established, except thecircuit request messages contain the same circuit identification number but with different destination station numbers. Aswith the trunk circuits, the broadcast connection cannot beused until a11 the circuits have been established, Disengagement ismore involved, Ifanonoriginating user wishes todisconnect, 4'/1989010985-057 that circuit isdisconnected but theremaining circuits arestill active. However, iftheoriginating user disconnects, allcircuits aredisconnected. 4.2 ACTS LBRSystem Performance Parameters Inorder touse the ANS X3.102 performance parameters toquantify the performance ofadvanced communication satellite systems such asACTS, the relationship andapplicability ofthe21ANSX3.102 performance parameters to thesatellite system operation must beinvestigated. Aswasdone inSection 3 for the various Tbe_ satellite communication systems, each ANS X3.102 performance parameter isexamined andrelated totheACTS LBRmode operation. Included inthis discussion isthe examination ofhow and towhat extent various mechanisms within the ACTS LBR system affect theestimates for the performance parameters. Table 5identifies theperformance parameters deemed applicable totheACTS LBRsystem. 4.2.1 Access The exact method ofuser access tothe ACTS LBR system depends onthe specific user/system interface used. The originating user requests a connection then waits until thecircuit isestablished"}
