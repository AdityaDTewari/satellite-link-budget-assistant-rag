If local data for the earth station height above mean sea level is not available, an estimate can be obtained from the maps of topographic altitude given in Recommendation ITU -R P.1511. The geometry is illustrated in Fig. 1. Rec.

Step 3 : Calculate the horizontal projection, LG, of the slant -path length from: LG = Ls cos  km (3) Step 4 : Obtain the rainfall rate, R0.01, exceeded for 0.01% of an average year (with an integration time of 1 min). If this long -term statistic cannot be obtained from local data sources, an estimate can be obtained from the maps of rainfall rate given in Recommendation ITU-R P.837. If R0.01 is equal to zero, the predicted rain attenuation is zero for any time percentage and the following steps are not required. 8 Rec.
