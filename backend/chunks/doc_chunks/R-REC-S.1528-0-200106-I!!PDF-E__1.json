ITU-R S.1528 p) that actual radiation patterns of some kinds of multiple beam antennas may be significantly different from beam to beam, recommends 1 that for multiple-beam non-GSO satellite antennas in the FSS having either circular or elliptical beams, the following radiation patterns should be used as a design objective or to perform interference analysis: 1.1 measured antenna patterns Measured antenna patterns should be used in performing interference analysis whenever they are available. When a measured pattern is not available, one or other of reference patterns given in the remaining sections may be used: 1.2 the reference pattern given by: G(ψ) = G m − 3 (ψ /ψb)α dBi for 0 < ψ ≤ aψb (1) G(ψ) = Gm + LN + 20 log ( z) dBi for aψb < ψ ≤ 0.5 bψb (2a) G(ψ) = Gm + LN dBi for 0.5 bψb < ψ ≤ bψb (2b) G(ψ) = X – 25 log ( ψ) dBi for bψb < ψ ≤ Y (3) G(ψ) ="}
