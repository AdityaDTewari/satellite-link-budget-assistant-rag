Command receiver operated off RFI receiver. (2) Center frequency of commmications transponder. The major approaches to signal processing centered upon a triple frequency­ time diversity technique conceived by Aerospace Corporation and developed by Electronic Communication Inc., and the frequency hopped Tactical Traismission System (TATS) developed by Lincoln Labs. Conventional analog FM and frequency division multiple access were also occasionally employed. Signal processing and link performance when the frequency diversity technique was employed on a channel summarized in Table 9-13 (33)(34)perturbed by Gaussian additive noise are The triple diversity modem handled 60 or 100 word per minute teletype using an asynchronous baudot code. Incoming teletype messages'were reclocked to obtain a uniform bit stream which could be split into three chips per bit. The three chips 9-27 were sequentially transmitted on three different frequencies. There was a constant frequency separation between the three \"Mark\" and three \"Space\" frequencies. The data demodulator used a phased lock loop to derive ship timing such that the proper pair of matched filters were sampled at the proper time. The total energy present in the three mark channels was compared with the total energy present in the three space channels for each bit time to decide if a \"Mark\" or \"Space\" had been sent. This system was designed specifically for aircraft and with its 100-kHz bandwidth provided good resistance to multipath fading-doWn to an elevation angle of about 40 to the satellite for an airplane flying at about 9144 meters (30,000 feet). The triple diversity also provided protection against RFI. Table 9-13.
