The 24 transmitting terminals will transmit a total of 39 randomly -staggered carriers in the 13-and 18-GHz bands. The transponder will receive signals from the transmitting terminals, translate them to approximately 4 -GHz,, and then retrans­ mit them. The receiving terminal and data-reduction equipment will receive the 4-GHz signals, separate the individual carriers, and record, the carrier powers for future analysis. There will be 24 transmitting terminals (15'dual-frequen6y and 9 diversity) located throughout the eastern half of the United.States., The dual-frequency terminals will be spaced at least 161 kin (100 miles)- apart and will transmit signals around both 18 GHz and 13 GHz. Those transmitting terminals are now installed. Three 18 GHz transmitters will be located 3-39 km (2-24 miles) from three dual frequency sites to investigate the use of site diversity to avoid the high single site margins required to, operate in these frequency'bands. The transmitting terminals consist of small parabolic-reflector-type antennas (positioned manually), a power amplifier; a frequency generator, a power-monitoring 13-122 system, a rain gauge, a strip-chart recorder, and an auxiliary power system for re­ cording rain data during the time the A/C power is not available. The transponder is a single-frequency conversion repeater with separate in­ puts at 13 and 18 GHz. Its combined outputs will be amplified and retransmitted at 4. 150 GHz ± 20 MHz. The transponder consists of redundant 13- and 18-GHz frequency translators, two bandpass filters, a combiner hybrid, two 3-stage tunnel diode ampli­ fiers, and two traveling-wave-tube amplifiers.
