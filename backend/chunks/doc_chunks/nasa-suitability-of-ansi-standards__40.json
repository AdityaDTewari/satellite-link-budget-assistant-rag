Table 5identifies theperformance parameters deemed applicable totheACTS LBRsystem. 4.2.1 Access The exact method ofuser access tothe ACTS LBR system depends onthe specific user/system interface used. The originating user requests a connection then waits until thecircuit isestablished andthedestination user hasanswered before transmitting anydata. Since theACTS LBRsystem isatrue DAMA satellite system generating new BTPs inreal time, access function performance isofinterest. Generic descriptions ofthefour performance parameters associated with the access function are given inSection 2,Seitz and Grubb (1983), and ANSI (1983). Access Time Access Time fortheACTS LBRsystem istheelapsed time from auser issuing aservice request tothestart oftheuser's data transmission. Itisassumed that theuser's earth station issynchronized tothenetwork; thus, only the call request _ust beprocessed. Asdescribed inSection 4.1.2, thecircuit is available foruseonly after thenewBTPhasbeen implemented. Ifmany circuit requests must beprocessed, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil allofthe requests canbeserved. Thus, Access Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic load, the number ofconnection/disengagement requests, and the number of 481989010985-058 49IIIIHIIIIIII- -HillI_'_'\"_'\"_\" '+'_e-':'+\" :\"_...... 1989010985-059 stations requiring FEC coding (FEC coding requires additional BTP changes). Access Time isone ofthe most significant ACTS LBR system performance parameters andistherefore included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance | parameters. Incorrect Access Probability Incorrect Access would occur intheACTS LBRsystem ifthere areundetected bit errors inthe inbound order wire address information totheMCS orthe BBPTP information from theMCStotheDRP. However, because cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) are used within the order wire and control information fields, undetected errors would befew. WRen anerror isdetected, therequest is ignored andaccess isdenied. Therefore, because ofthis lowprobability of occurrence and thedifficulty inmeasuring thenumber ofincorrect accesses, theIncorrect Access Parameter isnot included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. Access Denial Probability Access denial for the ACTS LBR system would occur when the system is operating close tocapacity andthus would notbeable tosupport anadditional circuit. Inthis case theBTPmaynotbeable toaccept anyadditional user traffic,"}
