Wideband Performance Experiments A. Received Carrier Power B. Insertion Gain Stability C. Noise Measurements: Continuous random, impulsive, periodic, baseband, ground terminal IF, and satellite noise D. Linear Distortion: Field-time, line-time, and short-time distortion plus amplitude-frequency and phase-frequendy char­ acteristic at both baseband and RF. E. Nonlinear Distortion: Differential gain, envelope delay, syn­ chronization nonlinearity, audio distortion, and intermodulation noise . F. Interference G.

Television -No appreciable degradation of the signal could'be attributed to the satellite except for the expected noticeable increase in noise. The received pictures at Pleumeur Bodou were always of excellent quality and were often transmitted over the European network. At Goonhilly Downs good quality of the satellite video channel was obtained; multipath and echo signals were imperceptible. Further, doppler frequency shifts are observed to have no effect on the quality of the received monochrome video signal. 2. Telephony -Links were always excellent with respect to the"}
