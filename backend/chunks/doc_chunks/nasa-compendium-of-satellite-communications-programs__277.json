INTELSAT IV F-7 was launched into orbit over the Atlantic Ocean and placed into service at 330 0 E longitude on November 21, 1973, supplementing INTELSAT IV F-3. The INTELSAT IVA satellite is expected to be ready for launch in 1975. It is a Hughes product, as is INTELSAT IV, and is presently under construction. Operational traffic projections for the composite INTELSAT system are shown in Figure 10210. The figures from 1971 onward-reflect the minimum projected yearly growth rate of 15%. Figures showvoice channels or half duplex circuits. 10-57 VOICE CHANNELS (Or Halt- Circuits) 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000 1965 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 Figure 10-10. INTELSAT Traffic Growth Projection (1965-1980) Although serving is an operational role, the unattended earth station located near McMurdo Station on Ross Island (166.6 E, 77.8 S), Antarctica, can also be considered a very successful experiment. This station became operational simulta­ neously with the first Pacific INTELSAT IV in mid-February 1972 and has since trans­ mitted data from the unmanned geophysical observatory (UGO), supported and owned by the National Science Foundation to the continental USA in the Jamesburg, California earth station thence to a computer facility at Stanford University (National Science Foundation contractor) by commercial telephone lines. 10-58 Data can be transmitted by the following: a. A non-return-to-zero, of 833 bps biphase modulated carrier providing a data rate b. A carrier which is frequency modulated by an analog data signal extending from 100 to 3000 Hz, and an FSK subcarrier (833 bps) at 5.5 kHz Selection and control can be performed remotely via a 100-bps command data book. The primary components of the Antarctic station are­ a. A fixed pointing 2.4-m (8. 0-ft) antenna b. A 20-watt TWT output amplifier C. Electronics for"}
