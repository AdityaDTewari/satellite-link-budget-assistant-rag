These experimental results clearly demonstrate that therain rateisuniform upto4kmaltitude andthen decreasesdramatically ataltitudes inthe6to8kmrange. Thisdecrease is also associated with theO°Cisotherm height. Note howthemedian isotherm height increases with theupdraft, convective, high rain rate cells. This effect will beused later inaGlobal Rain PredictionModel along with the seasonaldependence ofthemedian isotherm height. Abovethis isotherm, thehydrometeorsexist intheform ofice crystals andsnow. These forms ofhydrometeors donotcontribute significantly totheattenuation, butthey cangive rise todepolarization effects. 2.3 SPECIFICRAIN ATTENUATION 2.3.1 Scatterin 9 Rain drops both absorb andscattermicrowave energy along an earth-space path. Fromthebasic Rayleigh scatteringcriteria (thedimensions ofthescattereraremuch smallerthan thewavelength) andthefact that the median rain drop diameter isapproximately 1.5mm,onewould expect that Rayleigh scattering theory shouldbeapplied inthefrequency (wavelength) range from IOGHz (3cm) to100GHz(3mm). However, Rayleigh scatteringalso requires that theimaginary component oftherefractive index besmall,which g e 8 7 6 5 ] _'.4 <3 2 1 I,J0ii,,I,,ulu,,,,ll uulinu IIJlIII e_ WALLOPS ISLAND, VA. 1973 _ _\" _ 0C 0C CC . ,ol,,,I,,,,I, ,,I,, ,nI,,,o 35 40 45 50 55 60 REFLECTIVITY FACTOR, dBz... .,- 2 i. i. i i- ii:!),;_iiI ._-,. ;'2,i \".2\": i? !.'
