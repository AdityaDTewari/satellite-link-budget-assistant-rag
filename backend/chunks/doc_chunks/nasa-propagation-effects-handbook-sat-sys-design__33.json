Frequently this processhasnotbeen done accurately, resulting insmall segmentsofattenuation data which arenotrepresentative ofthelong term statistics.,• .. .! :•..:'/-- , .Z Based ontheabove discussionsitappears that theonly present recourse istoutilize rain•rate dataasderivable from Weather Bureau or other long-term measurements. Thisleads totheexceedance curves forrain rate. Theattenuation isthen derived from therelations between rain rate andattenuation. 3.1.2.2 OutagePeriod Statistics. System designers arealso interested in theaverage length oftime agiven threshold ofrain rate orattenuation is achieved (also termed theoutagetime). Inaddition, thedistribution ofthe outagetime about theaverage isdesired.Theoretical work ofLin(1973) has shown that thedistribution isapproximately lognormal..4 Besidestheoutagetime, Hyde (IgTg) hasidentified thedesire to know theaverage time between outage periodswithin agiven rain event, and theaverage time between outagesbetween tworain events. Thefirst case recognizes that outages above agiven threshold ofattenuation mayoccur several times during thesamegeneralrain event because therain rate is highly time dependent during anevent. Forexample, thepassage ofseveral rain cells associated with agiven rainfront will cause outages aseach cell dominatesthepath attenuation. Itisdesirable toknow theapproximate periodbetween these outagesandthedistributionofthese outage periodsasa function ofthreshold value andtype ofrain event. This type ofdata is expected tobedependent onthegeorgraphic region because theweather fronts 44 Z aredistorted bythepresence ofmountain ranges, lakes, cities, etc. Therefore, extrapolation toother regions isdifficult unless their weather systems aresimilar. Thesecond case (average time between outages intworain events) correlates theperiod between severe storms inagiven region. This period is expected tobeseasonally dependent because inmost regions thehighrain rate storms usually occur during ashort period oftheyear. Again, some statistical estimate oftheaverage period andthedistribution oftheperiods would bedesirable. Generally, outage period data isnotasreadily available asthe cumulative attenuation statistics data. Therefore, thedesigner must rely on thelimited data bases available from CCIR (1978, Rpt564-I), Comsat (Rogers andHyde-1979) orLin(1973). Anestimate oftheupper limit oftheoutage time ispresented inChapter VI. 3.2 RICE-HOLMBERG MODEL 3.2.1Types ofStorms TheRice-Holmberg (RH) Model(Rice andHolmberg-lg73) isbasedupon tworainfall types:"}
