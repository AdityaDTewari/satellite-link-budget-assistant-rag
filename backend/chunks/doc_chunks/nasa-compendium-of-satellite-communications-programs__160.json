Television Fort Dix to Andover through Syncom 1lrealized 26-dB p-p signal to rms noise ratio tt Kashima to Point Mugu through Syncom Ill realized 34-dB p-p signal to rms noise ratio.tt 6. Direct Aircraft TTY Pan American scheduled aircraft to Camp Roberts through Syncom III VHF command receiver and telemetry transmitter realized under proper conditions, up to 60-wpm TTY.tttt NOTES. 'Signal was 1-KHZ tone; 35 dB provided better than 99% sentence intelligibility. *Maximum was 10; lower ratios were also selectable. ***Four channel AN/TCC-3 multiplex employed on Syncom III. --'.On order of 105 bits/bit. tGround terminal equipment imposed limitations. ttVideo baseband bandwidth -2 5 MHz, p-p FM frequency deviation -4.5 MHz, preemphasis -14 dB, and audio signal transmitted separately.tttVtdeo baseband bandwidth -2 5 MHz, p-p FM frequency deviation -7 MHz, preemphasis -14 dB, sync pulses removed and regenerated at receiver, and audio handled separately. tttArcraft had vertically and horizontally polarized Yagi antennas.

NAT URE OF RESULTS OBTAINED Beacon receives total output power for no communications signal present. Communications input must be varied over several dB to completely sup­ press beacon and capture TT. Determined from poinit of maximum suppression of beacon signal. Good alignment found.' Measured"}
