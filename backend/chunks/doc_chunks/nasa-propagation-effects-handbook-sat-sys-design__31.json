Each ofthese models appears tohave advantages anddisadvantages dependingon thespecificapplication.Inthis chapter anattempt ismade tobriefly summarize thekeyfeatures offive commonly usedmodels without reiterating allofthedetails. Oneofthese models, TheGlobal Model, isrecommended for useasthedesign tool inChapter VIbecause itisboth accurate andeasy to apply without theneed foraspecializedcomputer program. Table3.1-isummarizesthekeyinputs, outputsandother important features ofthefivemodels intheir current format. These models are: P••Rice-Holmberg •.Dutton-Dougherty • Global eLin • Piecewise Uniform Rain Rate Nearly allofthese models arebeing updated andmodified based onrecent experimental results andanalyses.

Themodels provide either rain rate statistics orattenuation statistics. Generally, these statistics canberelated byuseofthespecific attenuation andeffective path length relations. Specific attenuation has been described inchapter II,while theeffective path length will be summarized attheendofthis chapter. Forexample, theRice-Holmberg model only computes theexceedance probability statistics forrain rate, butthis is relatable"}
