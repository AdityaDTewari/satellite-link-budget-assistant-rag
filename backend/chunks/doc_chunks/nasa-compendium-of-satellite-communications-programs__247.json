This sys­ tem configuration, in conjunction with the ground terminals available, provided INTELSAT I with a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity. The INTELSAT II system was designed to provide for frequency-division multiple­ access (FDMA) of the satellite by a number of earth terminals. Theoretical studies had shown that for multiple large index FM carriers accessing the transponder: (1) the satellite should be designed for a quasi-linear operation, (2) the maximum 10-23 Table 10-12.

To ensure compliance with these criteria, carrier control stations were established at Paumalu, Hawaii, and Andover, Maine, whereby the Atlantic and Pacific INTELSAT H systems could be monitbred, each from a single point. In early operations with INTELSAT II satellites, FM carriers centered at specific frequencies were preassigned to individual links between two points, thereby- retaining the point­ to-point mode of operation employed on INTELSAT I. However, multiple point-to­ point links were established through the INTELSAT 11 transponders. The system configuration described, together with the second generation ground complex, pro­ duced a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity foreach INTELSAT II satellite. It was"}
