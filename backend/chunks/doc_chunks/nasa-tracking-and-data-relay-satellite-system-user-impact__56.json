First, the return link appears to be adequately sized to bracket the user data rates specified in the study Statement of Work. Needless to say, the 7 dB difference between the 5 watt and 1 watt user critically affects the type of antenna required aboard the user satellite. The significance of this dB-for-dB coupling between antenna gain and transmitter power can be illustrated by taking a 2.5 kbps return link rate as an example. The curves show that the 5 watt user requires only a 0 dB antenna gain, whereas the I watt user needs 7 dB. Along with the 0 dB antenna gain comes the inherent quality of omni- directionality, whereas the 7 dB gain antenna requires either orientation, or switching between multiple 7 dB gain antennas, or accepting reduced user orbital coverage by the TDRS if only a single fixed 7 dB antenna gain can be afforded. Thus, wherever possible, to avoid the requirement of oriented or steered antennas, the user should provide about 5 watts of RF power into a low gain antenna. Given the parameters previously assumed, the forward link is not as well matched to the required data rates as the return link. For the ranges of bit rates required by the Statement of Work, that is 100 bps to 1024 bps, user antenna gains in the range of 6 to 16 dB are required. In order to reduce these gains to more modest levels, it is recommended that either the user's receiving system noise temperature be reduced or the TDRS transmit power be increased, or some combination of both. With respect to the former, the current Hughes TDRS baseline makes"}
