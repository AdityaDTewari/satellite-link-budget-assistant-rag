As has been indicated, LET-I was contained in two vehicles. The electronics vehicle was a modified low-bed commercial van which contained the signal processing equipment, a communications and antenna control console, a prime power generator and its fuel, an air conditioner, and storage for the antenna panels. The second 9r14 trailer, called the antenna vehicle, contained the -transmitter and its heat exchanger, a refrigerated parametric-amplifier receiver, low-level microwave equipment, the antenna backup structure, feeds, and servo-mechanism equipment. The use of cir­ cularly polarized antenna feeds made the terminal compatible with the circular polari­ zation employed by the"}
