Parameters of LIES-4 were altered by atmospheric drag due to the low perigee. I LES-4's initial spin axis orientation was such that solar panel illumination pro­ vided telemetry power only. By-late 1965, a residual magnetic moment'along the spin axis had precessed the spin vector until the sun was only 470 below the satellite equator. This provided sufficient solar power to allow operation of all systems. As a result of the unplanned orbit, one of the two onboard antenna switching control systems and the magnetic spin axis orientation system could not be operated. However, one of the two antenna switdhing control systems did operate properly and all of the objectives listed in Table 9-1, with the exception of Item 4, were for the most part successfully accomplished. The principal satellite commuiicitions terminals participating in experiments with the X-Band LES satellites are-listed in Table 9-3(6) (7) The terminal at Camp Parks and one of the terminals at Millstone Hill were the facilities originally"}
