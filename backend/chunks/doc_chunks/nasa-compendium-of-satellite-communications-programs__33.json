S. 's Intelsat for the Hotline, a direct communication link between Washington and Moscow. The Skynet and NATO programs evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s from tech­ nology developed in the U. S. military's IDCSP program. Skynet provided military communications for the United Kingdom (U. K.) and NATO did the same for the NATO countries. Neither system is presently operational, but followon systems are planned for both. Systems designed strictly to provide internal domestic communications for a particular country are still in their infancy. The first such system, Canada's Telesat program, became operational in 1973. Three U.S. systems were operational by the fal of 1974; additional U. S. systems and a European system are planned. Looking into the future, a number of potential new programs and continuations of old programs can be discerned. Plans exist for two additional highly classified LES experimental satellites, and it is expected that follow on U.S. military tactical satellite programs will evolve soon within each of the three services. The Communi­ cations Technology Satellite (CTS), sponsored jointly by Canada's Department of Com­ munications (DOC) and NASA, is expected to be launched late in 1975. CTS, being developed jointly by Canada and NASA with some involvement by ESRO, will be inte­ grated in Canada. The participants will conduct experiments on a time-shared basis. Intelsat has plans for Intelsat IVA and V, a series of spacecraft to advance their in­ ternational commercial system. The technology upon which the Intelsat V satellites will be based may be developed by a prototype or experimental satellite flown before the operational satellites are launched in the late 1970s. Some competition for future Intelsat systems is likely to emerge in the form of a Soviet Stationar program. The"}
