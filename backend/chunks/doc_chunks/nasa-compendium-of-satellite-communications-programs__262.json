Antenna sizes become relatively standardized at 97 feet diameter, partly to compensate for the somewhat higher noise temperatures resulting from the wideband feed systems, and partly to obtain a small performance marginfor the ter­ restrial stations. The characteristics for two third generation earth stations, Paumalu (Hawaii) and Fucino (Italy), are presented in Table 10-20. With both global and spot beam transponders, INTELSAT IV allows earth sta­ tions to operate with a large number of carriers. The result is that intermodulation distortion becomes an increasingly important consideration in earth station perform­ ance. The higher capacities associated with INTELSAT IV require existing earth .stations to verify a greater linear deviation capability, evaluate their threshold ex­ tension demodulator performance at the larger capacities, augment existing group de­"}
