The pointing error relative to the deck is less than +0.1 which is suffi­ cient to provide an overall boresight pointing accuracy of ±0.2 0 Each antenna is capable of simultaneous transmission and reception of ortho­ gonal linearly polarized signals. Isolation between the polarization is at least 25 dB. The antenna pattern generated by each antenna creates sidelobe levels expected to be -14 dB and -25 dB for the first and second sidelobes respectively. The primary TT&C antenna is a circularly polarized helix configuration mounted on the front deck. Boresight gains of 3 dB for telemetry and 2 dB for command are expected. During the station acquisition, and as an alternate during the synchronous phase, the TT&C data will be radiated through a 32 element circularly polarized belt array located at the aft end of the spacecraft thrust tube and providing a toroidal shaped pattern. An SHF beacon antenna mounted on the forward deck is the last component of the antenna package. 19-7 19.2.4 Attitude Control Subsystem The CTS attitude control subsystem consists of two basically distinct systems, one used during the station acquisition phases of the mission and the other during the synchronous operation phase. During the station acquisition phase the spacecraft is spin stabilized about its yaw axis at a rate of 60 rpm and a nutation damper controls disturbance torques. On station attitude control is accomplished through three-axis stabilization which utilizes the \"momentum bias\" principle of storing momentum nor­ mal to the orbit plane to provide gyroscopic stiffness in the orbit plane. Aboard the CTS angular momentum will be stored in a 3,740 rpm, 20 Nms (15 ft-lb-sec) fixed momentum wheel whose spin axis is parallel"}
