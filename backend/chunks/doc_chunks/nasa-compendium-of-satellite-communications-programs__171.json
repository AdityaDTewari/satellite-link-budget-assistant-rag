U.S. Air Force 18 (60) 1965 (LET-2) I ' Camp Roberts, California U.S. Army Satellite 9.1 (30) 1966 (LET-3) Communications Ageno 3 Tracking and VHF telemetry data was obtained primarily by the Camp Parks and Millstone Hill (West Ford) terminals. The satellite launchings were provided by the U.S. Air Force. The X-Band LES program was responsible for a number of significant contri­ butions to satellite communications technology. It proved the feasibility of building solids3tate X-band transponders for operation in a communications satellite. A useful communications capability was supplied even though satellite dc to RF power conver­ sion efficiency and- R-F power output-were-ralativelrlow-. The-fe--iTifl y-and-eor_­ mance capabilities of electronically switched despun antennas were demonstrated. A workable automatic magnetic spin axis torquing system for attitude correction was exhibited. The performance potential available through the application of convolution encoding and sequential decoding to satellite links was displayed. Frequency hopping was shown to be a satisfactory means of multiple access having no stringent synchroni­ zation requirements and giving considerable protection against interfering signals. Finally, the capabilities of both pitch-excited and voice-excited vocoders, when used over a satellite link, were demonstrated. The former handled speakers at the 9-6 satellite ground terminal while the latter allowed remote speakers, connected through the normal switched telephone network, to use low rate digital satellite voice circuits. 9.2.2 System Description The West Ford terminals contained conventional analog voice signal processing and frequency modulation equipment while the newly developed LET terminals were equipped for digital signal processing. As a result, the three LET terminals inter­ operated independent of the West Ford terminals. Individual terminal loop back tests plus half and full duplex two-terminal operations were conducted. Extensive multiple access tests were not performed due to the limited number of participating terminals having compatible modulation and signal processing systems. However,"}
