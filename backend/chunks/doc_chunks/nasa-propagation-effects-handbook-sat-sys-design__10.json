Inthecase ofclear airattenuation, adequate coverage has been given inother publications andsoonly asummary oftheestimation techniques ispresented. Theestimation ofdepolarization duetorain andice hasnotbeen developed tothedegree required forpreparing good design estimates forsatellite systems. Therefore, acomprehensive chapter on depolarization hasbeen included that attempts toconsolidate thework of several investigators inthis area. Inorder tomake theHandbook readily usable tomany engineers it hasbeen arranged intwoparts. Thenext four chapters comprise the descriptive part. They deal insome detail with rain systems, rain and attenuation models, depolarization andexperimental data. This descriptive part oftheHandbook isintended toprovide background forsystem engineers whowantmore detail than that presented inthelater design chapters. Chapters VIandVIImake upthedesign part oftheHandbook andmay beused almost independently oftheearlier chapters. InChapter VI,the design techniques recommended forpredicting propagation effects in earth-space co_unications systems arepresented. Some selection hasbeen made from alternative models inorder that only onedesign technique be utilized. This selection wasmade based ontheability ofthetechnique to model theexperimental results. Thechapter includes step-by-step procedures forusing theprediction models andnumerous examples. Chapter Vlladdresses thequestions ofwhere inthesystem design process theeffects ofpropagation should beconsidered, andwhat precautions should betaken when applying thepropagation results. Theunadvised useof propagation results inthelinkmargin canresult inoverdesign. This chapter bridges thegapbetween thepropagation research data andtheclassical link budget analysis ofearth-space communications system. This chapter presents a generalized design procedure, andillustrates itsusethrough extensive examples.

Themacroscopic characteristics include items such asthesize, distribution andmovements of rain cells, theheight ofmelting layers andthepresence oficecrystals. Themicroscopic characteristics include thesize distribution, density and oblateness ofboth •rain drops andicecrystals. Thecombined effect ofthe characteristics onboth scales leads tothecumulative distribution of attenuation anddepolarization versus"}
