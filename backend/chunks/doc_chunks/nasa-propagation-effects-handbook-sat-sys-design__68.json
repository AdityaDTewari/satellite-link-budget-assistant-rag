Thetrue XPDcould bemeasured with anideal antenna, capable ofbeing matched exactly totheco-andcross polarized state. Actual antennas arenotideal. They canbebuilt with outputs that closely approximate thecopolarized andcrosspolarized components ofthewave, butsome degree ofdegradationisalways present intheir performance. Here wepresent amethod ofquantifyinqthepolarization performance oftheantenna andtaking thisperformance into account in interpreting polarization measurements. From this point on,thereceive antenna polarization statesthat are close tothetrue co-andcrosspolarized wave states will bedistinguished from thetrue states byputting their names within quotationmarks. Isolation, I,isdefined astheratio oftheoutput power available attheantenna's \"copolarized\" port (Pc)totheoutput power atthe \"crosspolarized\" port (Px). Thepolarization statescoupled tothe \"copolarized\" and\"crosspolarized\" ports areacandax,respectively. Since theantenna isnon-ideal, acandaxarenotnecessarily orthogonal, andacdoes notnecessarily correspond tothepure copolarized state.
