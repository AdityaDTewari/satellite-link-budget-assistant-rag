Usually, one must leafthrough a telecommunications design handbook to obtain this information, but the program was designedto automatically integrate all of the antenna data from the Excel database into this interface. 6o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics IV. Results After using the link budget calculator tool to calculate a link, the results of each parameter that goes into calculating the link can be saved as an Excel or pdf ﬁle. A sample of the pdf output is shown in Figure10. Figure 10. A portion of the results given by the link budget calculator’s pdf output The same goes with the Visual Communication Payload Design Tool: Figure 11. Project Description of Design Report The Visual Communication Payload program will generate a report that always consists of the project description cover page as shown in Figure 11. 7o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 12. MEL/PEL Equipment List of Design Report In addition, the second page of the report contains a table of the relevant characteristics for each payload component for a mission, which is often the mass and power equipment list as shown in Figure 12. Figure 13. Component Description of Design Report Then, the rest of the report will contain detailed descriptions of each component such as in Figure 13. Each page is one component, and within each page, a picture is in the top right corner while the relevantcharacteristics are in the top left table. Then the rest of the compoents characteristics are in the main table. V. Conclusions The creation of these two tools will have shortened the pre-design process for a NASA by performing all the functions needed for a designer as well as making it easy to use for the designer.
