For example, if(S/N)composit e<10dBisanoutage, then forabent pipe repeater either (S/N)up <10dBor(S/N)down <10dBwould constitute link outage events. Now, avariety ofcombinations (e.g., (S/N)up =13dBand (S/N)down <13dB)canalso result inanoutage condition. However, 373 assuming uncorreiated statistics andasmall percentage oftimecriterion, these joint contributions canbeignored with only slight error, since they arevery small.

Using this outage time suballocation isparticularly appropriate in digital systemswhere only afewdBseparate nominalandbarely acceptable performance. Thenominal performance analyses (not syntheses) areperformed initerations subsequent totheinitial design. These performance analyses must notbeneglected,however, sinceasystemdesign that meets aparticular outageoravailability criterion does notnecessarily meet itsother performance criteria (e.g., nominal performance). This isparticularly important inanalog systemswhere there canbeawide gapbetween what is considered anoutage andwhat isrequired most ofthetime. Since itappears• that most satellitesystems being designed forabove 10GHzaredigital, this difficulty isperhaps• academic. Inpractice, theuseofavailability alone, orinconjunction with outagedurationcharacteristics, isprevalentinthe design ofsuch systems. InTable7.3-1, wegive thesimplifying rules ofthumb which may usually beemployed forsuballocation ofoutage time, TOUT. Intheduplex case, theexact value ofTOUTrelative toitsupper andlower bounds depends onthetype ofrepeater andonthejoint statistics ofoutage(i.e., the correlations between outages). Thelower bound will apply ifaperfect correlation ofoutages exists ontheup-anddownlinktoasingle terminal. Ingeneral, theallocation ofcarrier-to-noise ratios among the several links isamore difficult problem.
