Some competition for future Intelsat systems is likely to emerge in the form of a Soviet Stationar program. The U. S. S.R. has been granted allocations by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for a geostationary satellite system operating at C-Band. Additionally, experi­ mental Franco-German Symphonie and Italian Sirio programs are underway that will provide much of the basis for the intra-European system being developed by the European Space Research Organizaton (ESRO). Finally, a completely new use for 1-12 satellite communications technology has recently become apparent. This is in the area of air and marine traffic management. 1.3 EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY The low altitude Score satellite employed simple off-the-shelf VHF hardware to dramatize the potential of satellite communications by broadcasting a prerecorded Christmas message from President Eisenhower in 1958. From this beginning, the interest in satellite communications began to mount in the early 1960s. Major initial areas of concern centered upon the type of satellite to select, type of orbit to employ, frequencies to utilize, and the development of ground terminal technology compatible with satellite communications. The basic satellite question was whether active or passive satellites should be employed. Either store and forward or real time active satellite repeaters were feasible. Passive reflector systems could be composed of a relatively small number of large single point reflecting structures or belts of multiple dispersed reflective elements. To resolve the orbit selection issue, low, medium and synchronous altitudes had to be considered, as did orbit in­ clination and degree of ellipticity. Frequencies appropriate for consideration were determined to be in the band from 1 to 10 GHz. Ground terminal technology of parti­"}
