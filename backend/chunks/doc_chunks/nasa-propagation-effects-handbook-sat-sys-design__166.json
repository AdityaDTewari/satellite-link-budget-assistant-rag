Except forfade depths in excess of20dB,theaccuracy oftheattenuation measurements is+_idB. These rain fade results, while representative ofthose taken atRosman, donot appear tobesufficiently accurate fordeepfades because thesignal levels approach thenoise floor ofthereceiver. Forone-minuteaverages, no measurable selective fading wasobserved (WEC-1977). Thecross-correlation of4a_d6GHzsignalsduetolowangle fading intheCanadian arctic wasfound tobelow(Strickland, etai-1977). During a 2.5hour period onthedaywhen thefading wasmost severe thecorrelation coefficient was0.34 since the6GHzsignal experienced 55%more fades than the4GHzsignal. This would indicate adispersion waspresent,butthe mechanism forthis effect istropospheric refraction andnotrain. Frequency selectivefading maybesignificant atlowelevation angles. 6.8.2.2PhaseVariations. Phasemeasurements have notyielded significant results forfrequencies above 10Gflz. Thephase coherent sidetone signals on ATS-6 showedonlyminor variations across the1.44 GHzbandwidths. These variations were most evident fortheshorter (one andfour second) averaging periods compared totheone-minute period (WEC-Ig77). Phasemeasurements havebeenattempted fortheonedegreeelevation angle satellitesobserved from thearctic (Strickland etai-1977). Unfortunately, nosignificantfade events occurred andnodifferential phase variations were recorded. Phase effectsareproduced bythemolecular absorption mechanism along with amplitude effects. Large values ofphase dispersionwould therefore beexpected intheabsorption bands. 6.8.3Ionospheric Effects onBandwidth Coherence 6.8.3.1Amplitude Variations.Ionospheric attenuation isinversely proportional tothefrequency squared (Millman-1958) andisgenerally less than 0.001 dBat15GHzandanelevation angle 0=90°.Thevariation is 331 ............ •..... ,........................ \"........ •...... •...... ...... ............ :,,.'. approximately related tocosecant O.Theattenuation istherefore usually less than"}
