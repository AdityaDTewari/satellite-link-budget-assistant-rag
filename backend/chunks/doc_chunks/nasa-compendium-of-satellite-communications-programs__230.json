Eight INTELSAT Ill satellites were launched between September 1968 and July 1970 as indicated in Table 10-3. Launch failures in September 1968, July 1969, and July 1970 made three.of these satellites unusable. A successful launch in December 1968 placed a spacecraft in service over the Atlantic. Some difficulties were encountered when this satellite's mechanically despun antenna 10-4 Table 10-2. INTELSAT H Spacecraft .
