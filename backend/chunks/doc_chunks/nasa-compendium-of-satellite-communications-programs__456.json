The TACSAT 1 spacecraft was designed to operate in a variety of modes to accommodate the planned tests with terminals of different capabilities. Functionally, the communi­ cations subsystem consisted of a UHF frequency translating repeater and an SHF fre­ quency translating repeater, each capable of operating with selectable bandwidths from UHF to SHF and from SHF to UHF. The modes were under control of commands transmitted by-the satellite control ground station. In keeping with the concept of mobile terminal simplicity, the satellite performed system frequency control by transmitting UHF and SHF beacon signals for use as references for all transmit and receive function frequencies generated at the terminals, and for antenna pointing. Table 14-4 shows the operating frequency bands at UHF and SHF for communica­ tion and T and C purposes. Table 14-4.
