This fact is evident for two reasons. First, the number of terrestrial transmitters at 2 GHz is far less than the profuse numbers which exist globally at VHF and low UHF. An allo- cation of a small slot of frequency spectrum needed for the LDR service is probably much easier to obtain relatively interference-free at S-band than in the lower bands. Furthermore, whereas the almost 3-to-i frequency difference between the UHF and VHF links precluded the use of a single antenna for both links, that possibility can now be considered at S-band. Also, at S-band the aperture becomes smaller and the radiation pattern interaction between the antenna elements and the spacecraft structure becomes less severe. Despite the fact that VHF and UHF have been deleted, the preliminary data gathered on antennas for these frequency ranges are in- cluded in this section for the purpose of completeness. 4-3 During the study effort, discussion with the GSFC User Impact Study program office(3) led to a request for this contractor to submit data on antennas which have been designed in-house. That is, emphasis is to be on hardware experience with data points extrapolated where necessary to the proper S-band frequency. These antennas, which are identified in Section 4.3, represent viable candidates for the user spacecraft since their weights and functions are more in line with anti- cipated user missions. Primarily because the data collected on S-band antennas has assumed a greater significance, this information is pre- sented in Section 4.3, whereas the data on VHF and UHF antennas (plus scaled information for S-band) is held off until Section 4.4. 4-4 4.2 Technical Considerations Antennas performing over the three distinct bands of VHF, UHF and S-band have"}
