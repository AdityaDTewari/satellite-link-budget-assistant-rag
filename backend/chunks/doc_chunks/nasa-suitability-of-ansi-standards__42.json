Inanonrevenue generating system such asACTS, theAccess Outage Probability isexpected tobehigher because ofitsexperime_ital nature; however, theconsequences ofaccess outage arenot assevere asfor revenue generating networks. Therefore, Access Outage Probability isnot included in thesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.2 User Information Transfer The user information transfer for the ACTS LBR system islike other connection oriented digital communication systems. Thepath throu6n thesystem fortheuser's data does nutchange fortheduration ofthecall. The ANS X3.102 block-oriented user information transfer parameters are associated with transporting user defined information units. Normally users define block lengths that arecompatible with their data processing equipment orhigher layer protocols, regardless ofhowthecommunication system packages their data. However, because theACTS LBRsystem handles alldata in64-bit increments, when looking atsystem level performance, ablock isdefined as 64user bits. This does notseverely limit theusefulness ofthese performance parameters asmost common user defined blocks areinteger multiples of64bits. Generic descriptions oftheiiperformance parameters associated with the user information transfer function are given inSection 2and inSeitz and 511989010985-061 i Grubb (1983). These bit and block parameters are transfer described mathematically inANSI (1983). BitError Probability The Bit Error Probabi]ity isthe same parameter that isused inlink performance measurements andlink power budget calculations oftypes AandB satellite systems. Itisafunction ofthechannel signal-to-noise ratio and transmission rate (see Appendix). The ACTS LBR system has aBit Error Probability design goa] of]0-6 Because BitError Probability isoneofthe most common measures ofdigital communication system performance itisincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. BitMisdelivery Probability Inconnection o_iented systems, such asACTS, once auser information bit enters the system ithas only on_ path tofollow and thus will reach the desired destination. Also, because theACTS LBRsystem handles theuser data in64bit blocks, itwo1:id bevery unlikely that asingle bit would be misrouted. Therefore, BitMisdelivery Probability isnotincluded intheset ofACTS performance parameters. BitLoss Probability Again, once auser information bitenters thesystem"}
