The system control stations at Belgium and Germany receive and process the same information independently, and are inter­ connected via a land data link so that the system can be controlled from either station by using the equipment provided at the other station. In effect, there is redundancy in the control system. Each control center is provided with computation and display equipment for the analysis and dis­ play of the incoming data. A TTY orderwire network via the satellite has been provided to allow the controller to forward specific control in­ structions to any station. 3. Communications or traffic control originates at the technical control cen­ ters in accordance with applicable NATO directives. This control-is under the operational direction of SHAPE for the NATO SATCOM Phase II system. 16.2.2 Phase HI Table 16-6 shows the principal requirements that were selected as the basis for planning NATO SATCOM Phase IH. Communications service will be provided by voice, data and teletype using FM modulation as in Phase I. In addition, each link will"}
