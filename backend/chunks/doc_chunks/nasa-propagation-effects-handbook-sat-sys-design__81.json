Frequency andRain Rate DependenceofXPDandCPA II 149 , Much ofwhat isknown about icecrystal depolarization hasbeen learned only very recently. Bostian andAllnut (Ig7g) present agood summary ofrecent work inobserving andexplaining thephenomenon. Much ofwhat follows isfrom that source. 4.4.1 Meteorological Presence ofIce Clouds presentabove thefreezing level consist, completely orin part, oficecrystals. Cirrus clouds, andthe\"anvil\" that forms atthetop ofmature thunderstorms areallice,andtheupper parts ofcumulonimbus clouds arepredominately ice. Thecrystals that arepresent have oneoftwo shapes determined bythetemperature atthetime offormation. Very cold temperatures, below about -25°C, favor theformation ofneedle-shaped crystals. Flat,plate-like crystals form inamoderately cold environment (-90 to-25°C). Thedimensions ofthecrystals vary between about O.land lmm.! \" Icecrystals form ondust particle nucleiintheatmosphere. The relative abundance ofdustparticles has.been hypothesized asthereason for differences observedinicedepolarization atdifferent locations. In maritime regions, theaircontains relatively fewdust particles compared with continental areas. Asaresult ofthis, maritime airtends tohave fewer, but larger iceparticles than continental airunder similar conditions. Itis believed that thepresence oflarger crystals accounts forthegenerally higher values ofXPDobserved inmaritime versus inland locations (i.e., BTL versus VPI&SU). Like raindrops, icecrystals arenon-symmetrical andthey have a dielectric constant much different from air. These aretwoofthenecessary conditions fordepolarization. Athird condition, apreferred particle alignment, isalso required. Oblate raindrops arealigned byaerodynamic forces, andtheir preferred alignment direction isaffected bytheprevailing winds. Aerodynamics also have arole inaligning iceparticles, butitis believed electrostatic forces also play alarge part. This belief is supported bymany observations during thunderstorms ofrapid XPDchanges coinciding with lightning flashes. This coincidence maybeexplained bythe 150 ..,\"/ e following: Electric fields present inregions between oppositely-charged clouds exert torques onthehighly non-symmetrical icecrystals. When the field issufficiently strong, these torques become significant incomparison with theturbulent aerodynamic forces, resulting inanaverage alignment of the\"needle\" crystal axes andthe\"plate\" crystal planes along thedirection of thefield lines. When alightning discharge takes place between theclouds, charges areequalized andtheelectric field intensity drops. Aeroydnamic forces then predominate, andthecrystals quicklylose their preference fora particular direction oforientation. 4.4.2 Model"}
