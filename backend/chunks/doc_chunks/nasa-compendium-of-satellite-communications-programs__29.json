Automatic satellite turn-offs to start in 1972 and be completed by mid-1974 failed to operate. GGTS 1 and DODGE were em­ ployed for a time to evaluate gravity gradient stabilization. DATS 1 provided data on electroni­ cally despun phased array antennas. Two spin stabilized satellites successfully em­ ployed. Both remain usable. Communications experiments essentially completed by early 1969. One satellite designed for gravity gradient stabilization successfully employed. It remains usable. Most experiments that appear likely to be conducted completed by early 1971. One satel­ lite providing 9-meter (30-foot) parabolic antenna operational; plans for second uncertain. One satellite successfuly employed. Operational until December 1972. No definite plans exist for additional satellites. One satellite successfuly employed, active through November 1972. Plans exists for at least one additional Skynet-2 satellite. Two satellites successfully employed to form NATO Phase II system; one remains active in stand-by status. Plans exist for a Phase IlI system. Program DSCS Phase II Telesat Communi- cations Technology Satellite (CTS) Domestic Communi- cation Satellites (Domsats) Table 1-1.
