Anapproximate FMbaseband bandwidth isfound from Carson's rule B-2fm(m +I)o [ii] From these bandwidths andmaximum frequencies, system channel capacity canbe calculated. Pritchard andSciulli (1986) dothis forvarious channel multiplex hierarchies. They also expand these basic equations tocover multiple channel percarrier andtelevision applications, including preemphasis andpsophometric weighing factors typically specified FMmultiplex systems. System capacity calculations fordigital transmission systems aresomewhat simplified. Thebasic unit ofmeasure isthebitenergy-to-noise density ratio (Eb/No). ForBPSK Eb/No isdirectly related toC/No by Eb/No =C/No xTb [12] where Tb=thetransmitted bitduration inseconds and =i/Rb (the inverse ofthetransmitted bitrate). For power limited satellite communication systems, Figure A-I shows the theoretical relationship between biterror probability andEb/No. Inpractical systems this relationship also depends onthemodulation techniques anderror correction coding used, Feher (1983) andWhalen (1971) discuss atlength, the I:i relationships ofPe,Eb/No, modulation, andcoding. With therequired Pe,andknowledge ofthemodulation techniques anderror correction coding used, the required Eb/No can befound from graphs like Figure A-I. From this, and thesatellite link C/No, thechannel transmitted bitrate canbefound by 801989010985-089 Figure #-i.Biterror ratevs.Eb/No. 811989010985-090 Rb-(CINo)/(Eb/No). [13] Theuser's data rate isrelated tothetransmitted bitrate bythemodulation technique anderror correction coding used. InTDMA systems, theuser's data rate also depends onthelength oftheTDMA frame andnumber ofoverhead bits inthevarious control andsynchronization fields. Feher (1983) andPritchard andSciulli (1986) discuss TDMA frame structures, synchronization techniques, andsystem capacity calculations. Using the_elationsh_p ofEb/No andPefrom Figure A-l, theadvantage of onboard digital signal regeneration iseasily shown.
