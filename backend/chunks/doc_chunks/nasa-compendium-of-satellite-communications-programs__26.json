II, and Telesat programs. Additionally, a Canadian domestic satellite system is operational, and the U. S. domestic satellite systems, one leasing channels from the Canadian Satellite (Telesat or ANII9, are operational. Satellite experimentation has been con­ tinued by the Lincoln Experimental Satellite (LES), Applications Technology 'Satellite (ATS), and Tacsatcom programs. A more detailed summary of the programs reviewed in this document is provided in Table 1-1. The table includes an indication of individual program sponsorship and mission. These have been powerful factors dictating the lines along which programs evolved. Accordingly, the programs can be grouped into U. S. military, purely scientific, international commercial, foreign military, and domestic commercial categories. A considerable amount of scientific investigation has been done by U.S. military programs, but for the most part, it has been channeled towards the specific goals of 1-5 Table 1-1.
