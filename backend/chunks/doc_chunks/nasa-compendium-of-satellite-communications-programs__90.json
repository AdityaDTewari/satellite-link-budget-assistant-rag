However, the satellite's early failure clearly demonstrated the need for additional care and effort in designing and testing components and systems intended for operational satellite applications. 4.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Tests were conducted with Courier Ibon a loop-back or push-to-talk basis by the two terminals indicated in Table 4-2. Both real time and store-and-forward operation was possible. During store-and-forward operation, an earth terminal could load traffic into the spacecraft's tape recorders at the same time it received previously stored messages from the satellite. The altitude and inclination of the satellite orbit made an average of five workable orbits at the Fort Monmouth station and an average of seven at the Puerto Rico station possible out of approximately 14 orbits per day. (3) The satellite was in view of the ground station during each orbit for a maximum of 19 minutes at Fort Monmouth and 22 minutes at Puerto Rico. (2) Mutual visibilities as long as 15 minutes were available. 4-2 Operating frequencies for the Courier satellites were as indicated in"}
