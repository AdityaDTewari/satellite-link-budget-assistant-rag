This allowed all antenna elements to be arranged in one switched ring providing a higher gain. Visual sensors served as inputs to two different antenna-pointing logic -_systems._One-system-operate-much-as-that-on-LES t-and-2-n-ecasuring spin rate and determining direction of the earth center once per revolution. The second measured earth direction at one point in the orbit and time to travel to a second known point in the orbit. Assuming a circular orbit, this allowed predictions of earth direction to be derived as a function of orbital position. The transponder was the same as that on LES-2 except for changes in the crystal mixer, IF amplifier, directional couplers, and power monitoring circuits. An isolator was eliminated, line lengths reduced, and connectors matched at operating frequencies. These changes increased-transmitter power-by 3 dB and suppressed spurious frequencies. The autonomous magnetic torquing system generated two orthogonal axes in inertial space and measured spin axis orientation relative to these 9-12 axes once per orbit at points, 90* apart, where the satellite orbit intersected these fixed axes. LES-4 also included a radiation experiment to measure spatial and tempora'vaizriattons of the teiirgy spectrinnlf trjped elctrohs. The spectrum was measured in five energy ranges from 130 keV to 4 MeV. 9.2.4 Ground Terminals Among the terminals listed in Table 9-3, the Lincoln Experimental Terminals were the major stations inv6lved in experiments with the X-band Lincoln Experimental Satellites. LET-i and LET-2 performed most of these tests. The characteristics of LET-1 are summarized in Table 9-7(9) Characteristics of theexisting Millstone Hill antenna and RF equipment employed in LET-2 were discussed in the descriptionof Project West Ford ground-stations in Section-5. 4. A block diagram of the LET-1 system is shown in Figure:9-3(9). RANGE \" -TRANSMITTER\"]1'SOEC TIME Dr GENERATOR FgDOPPLER LFREUENCY CONTROL X-BAND SCARRIER A.B..
