The first was a measurements program for estimating the belt orbit parameters, ovei an extended period of time, studying diso-ersion of the belt with time, deter­ mining the variatioi'bfdipole density along the orbit with time; and estimating the total number of dipoles. The second program, determining the properties of the dipole belt as a communications medium, had two major goals: the first was the measurement of the.propagation characteristics of the belt; the second goal was the achievement of digital data transmission at high rates consistent with the density of the dipoles in orbit. Physical measurements of the -dipole belt were obtained by three distinct approaches. The first approach involved monostatic pulse radar operations to measure range, angles, andscattering cross-section; The second apptoach involved direct measurement of path loss for bistatic CW transmissions from one side to the other via belt scattering. The ,third approach involved inference concern­ ing belt dimensions which may be made from bistatic measurements of doppler spread. 5-8 Table 5-2.
