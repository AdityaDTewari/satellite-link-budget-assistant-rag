Maritime radio communications via geostationary satellite has been demon­ strated'to be feasible in a number of ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communications tests. (5)Participating ships have included the Coast Guard cutters Glacier and ' Klimath, the S. S. Santa Lucia,(21) and the German ships Gauss and Meteor. Successful experiments have been conducted with ships operating in the Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic and the Atlantic Oceans. Indications were that S/N ratios of about 40 dB could conveniently be attained on a voice channel and data error rates on the order of 103 and 104 bits/bit realized at 600 bps transmission rates. Short term fade depths in the order of 12 dB were observed in some tests. Data dissemination in a meteorological network was displayed in the WE FAX experiment; Data collection from small unmanned stations was' demonstrated-as\" part of OPLE. Additionally, special hydrological (2 2) and ocean buoy experiments (2 3 ) have shown successfully that satellites can be employed.for remote.station interrogation and data transfer. Signal fading was observed.to be a significant factor to be con­ sidered in -designing operational systems. ±3-27 VHF ranging experiments have displayed the feasibility of employing satellites operating at these frequencies for navigational purposes. Tests indicated that position fixing accuracies within ± 2 km (41 n. mi.) were attainable. (2 4 ) The satellite's VHF transponder has also been used in time dissemination experiments conducted by ESSA and the National Bureau of Standards, Accuracies of better than 10 micro­ seconds have been demonstrated. (25) The VHF transponders on ATS-1 and 3 have, additionally, been employed in various special tests and demonstrations. These include communications support for selected Apollo landings"}
