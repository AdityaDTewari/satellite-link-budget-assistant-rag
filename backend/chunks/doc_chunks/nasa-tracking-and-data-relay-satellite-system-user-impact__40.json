Such an antenna is theoretically capable of achieving approximately a 3 dB gain relative to an isotropic circularly polarized reference with less than 3 dB axial ratio over a beamwidth of 130 degrees. The configuration of such an antenna is shown in Figure 4.13. Typical dimensions for 2.25 GHz are also given in the figure. The radiation pattern of this antenna is ideally a cardioid with the null of the pattern along the axis of the antenna. 4-31 6.7 cm m.

Quadrifilar Helical CP Element 4-34 The quadrifilar helix antenna has the desirable property of reversing the direction of the pattern null, causing the beam to cover the opposite hemisphere, by reversing the phase of the feed between bifilar elements.(22) Consequently, a set of three such antennas orthogonally mounted on a user spacecraft could achieve the effect of six selectable elements if a dual-mode reversible feed network is implemented in the design. This type of antenna appears to lend itself well to stowage and deployment along its axis. Typical characteristics of a 2.25 GHz quadrifilar helix antenna are given in Table"}
