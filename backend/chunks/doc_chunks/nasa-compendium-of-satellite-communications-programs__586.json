The main array will provide a total of 1260 watts at beginning of life in two buses. The experiments bus will have 1040 watts at 76 volts while the housekeeping bus will have 220 watts at 28 volts. Assuming the initial power estimates are achieved, the 19-8 blankets will have a power to mass ratio of 93 watts/kg (42 watts/lb), while the entire subsystem power to mass ratio is 25.1 watts/kg (11.4 watts/lb). To obtain maximum power from the cells while on station each sail will be equipped with a sun tracking mechanism. The sails will rotate one revolution per day 0in increments of 0. 125 The final components of the subsystem are the two Ni-Cd batteries containing twenty-four 5 amp-hour. (AH) cells mounted in aluminum or magnesium blocks for heat sinking. The batteries will have the means to recondition by discharging to a specified level but normally the batteries will be continuously charging. The normal charge rate is C/20, where C is ampere hour capacity at 298.1 0K (25°C), although higher rates to C/10 will be provided. 19.2.6 Communications Subsystem The communications subsystem of the CTS is illustrated in Figure 19-2. The experiment package consists of SHF communications transponder, SHF communications transmitter experiment package (TEP), SHF beacon, and antenna subsystem. The communications transponder portion of the experiment consists of the basic communi­ cations system on the CTS; an input multiplexer, receiver, and two 20 watt traveling wave tube amplifiers. Two significant innovations in this transponder system are the use of Field Effect Transistor (FET) amplifier instead of Transferred Electron Ampli­ fiers (TEA) and the first space use of a low noise parameteric amplifier (noise figure of 3.3 dB). The primary technological experiment of the CTS program, however, is in the transmitter"}
