The frequency dependent specific phase dispersion is shown in Fig. 6 for a standard atmosphere (𝑝 = 1 013.25 hPa, ρ = 7.5 g/m3, 𝑇 = 15oC). FIGURE 6 The frequency dependent specific phase dispersion for a standard atmosphere (𝒑 = 1 013.25 hPa, 𝛒 = 7.5 g/m3, 𝑻 = 15oC) 4 Downwelling and upwelling microwave brightness temperature Microwave brightness temperature is defined as the noise temperature at the output of a lossless antenna due to the incident atmospheric brightness. Noise power spectral density, 𝑆(𝑓), and noise temperature, 𝑇(𝑓), are related by 𝑆(𝑓)=𝑘 𝑇(𝑓), where 𝑘 is Boltzmann’s constant. The downwelling space -to-Earth microwave brightness temperature looking up and the upwelling Earth -to-space microwave brightness temperature looking down can be calculated similar to equation (13).
