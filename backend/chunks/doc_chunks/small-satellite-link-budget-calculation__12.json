Usually, the Link budget is computed to provide a SNR greater than minimum SNR at the entrance of the LNA of the receiver. For this method it is necessary to know the bandwidth used by the receiver Method 2 : Eb=N0Method (less realistic). It is assumed that the receiver uses the minimum possible bandwidth Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 41/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions HUMSAT-D: Link budget Transmitter power 0.5 W Transmitter power 27 dBm TTC antenna gain -6 dBi Transmission Losses 0.1 dB Tx Impedance mismatch 0.5 dB EIRP 27\u00006\u00000:1\u00000:5 = 20:4dBm Distance (H=800 Km, = 15o, f=437 MHz) 2030 Km Free-space basic transmission loss 151.4 dB Atmospheric loss 0.18 dB Polarization loss 3 dBi Basic transmission loss 154.58 dB Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 42/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions HUMSAT-D: Link budget II GS Antenna Gain 18.95 dBi Unpointing loss 1 dB Rx Impedance mismatch 0.51 dB Received power 20.4-154.58+18.95-1-0.51 = -116.74 dBm Received power at receiver -116.74+17.5 = -99.24 dBm Margin with sensitivity -99.24-(-118) = 18.76 dB Bandwidth 5 KHz Noise 604:8\u00011:379\u000110\u000023\u00015000 = 4:2\u000110\u000017W Noise -133.8 dBm SNR -116.74-(-133.8) = 17.06 dB SNR Minimum 13 dB Margin 17.06-13 = 4.06 dB Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 43/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions Low elevation angle Low elevation angle e ects Greatest distance with the satellite Maximum Doppler shift Maximum atmospheric losses Greater noise (man-made and Earth noise) Ground re ection Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 44/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions Di erence between small and large satellites Di erence between small and large satellites The antenna gain at the satellite is"}
