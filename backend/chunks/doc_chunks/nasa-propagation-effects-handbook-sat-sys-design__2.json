ABSTRACT ThisPropagation Handbook provides satellite system engineers withaconcise summary ofthemajorpropagation effects experienced on earth-space pathsinthe10to100GHzfrequency range. Thedominant effect-attenuationduetorain -Isdealt withinsomedetail, interms ofboth experimental datafrom measurements made intheU.S. andCanada, andthemathematical andconceptual models devised toexplain thedata. Inordertomake theHandbookreadily usabletomany engineers, ithasbeen arrangedintwoparts.ChaptersII-V comprise thedescriptivepart. They dealinsomedeta11wlth rain systems,rain andattenuationmodels, depolarization andexperimental data.Chapters VIandVIImake upthedesign partoftheHandbookandmaybeused almostindependently oftheearlier# chapters. InChapter VI,thedesigntechniques recommended forpredicting propagationeffects Inearth-space communications systemsarepresented. Chapter VIIaddresses thequestionsofwhere inthesystemdesignprocess theeffects ofpropagation should beconsidered, andwhatprecautions should betakenwhenapplying thepropagation results. Thtschapter bridges thegap between thepropagationresearch dataandtheclassicalllnk budget analysis ofearth-space communications system. :Ill PREFACE ThisHandbook could neverhavebeen preparedwithout thetwenty years ofNASA andprivate industry supported research that precedes its publication. Theauthors atORIhave, inlarge measure, rearranged and organized work ofother researchers toputtheir contributions into perspective with theoverall developmentofthebody ofknowledge of tropospheric effects onearth-space microwave paths. Theauthors' main contributions have come inbridging between theresults ofothers. Therefore,thecredit forthis Handbook must gotothose cited so liberally asreferences andtotheNASA personnel oftheCommunications and Information Systems Division oftheOffice ofSpace andTerrestrial Applications whohave sponsoredandguided thedevelopment ofthis Handbook. Theauthors herein acknowledge their support technically andfinancially. This secondedition oftheHandbook incorporates numerous corrections andmodifications. Avery thorough critique byE.Smith andW.Flock ofJPL, forwhich wearehighly appreciative, resulted inalarge number ofchanges. Thecomments ofusers ofthehandbook also pointed outseveralneeded changes. Wehave included, primarily inChapters 3,5and6,thesignificant contributions ofpropagation researchers that have been published over the last severalmonths. Chapter 7hasbeen modified toinclude additional guidance inallocating link performance andavailability. Precedingpageblank v Finally, theauthors acknowledge thenumerous technical discussions, comments, mitten material, andgeneral guidance provided byDr.LouisJ. Ippolito. Towhatever extent thisHandbook meetsitsobjectives, itisin largemeasure duetoDr.Ippolito's guidance.i:: ii?:427 ::':21:;' '•22 ,2:- './..-._• :T-'. ?'.';.: •ci.\" ,LI a vi TABLE OFCONTENTS ABSTRACT............................
