The data file contains the coefficients 𝑎𝑜, 𝑏𝑜, 𝑐𝑜 and 𝑑𝑜 for frequencies between 1 GHz and 350 GHz in 0.5 GHz increments and an additional frequency of 118.75 GHz. 2 Slant path water vapour gaseous attenuation prediction methods There are four prediction methods for the slant path gaseous attenuation attributable to water vapour: 1) As described in § 2.1, an instantaneous prediction method, where the total (barometric) surface pressure, surface temperature and surface water vapour density are known from instantaneous local measured data; 2) As described in § 2.2, an instantaneous prediction method, where the total (barometric) surface pressure, surface temperature, surface water vapour density and integrated water vapour content are known from instantaneous local measured data; 3) As described in § 2.3, a statistical prediction method, where the statistics of total (barometric) surface pressure, surface temperature, surface water vapour density and integrated water vapour content are known, either from local data or from the integral maps at the desi red location in Recommendation ITU -R P.2145 ; and 4) As described in § 2.4, the Weibull approximation to the slant path statistical prediction method, where the Weibull scale and shape parameters are known, either from local data or from the integral maps at the desired location in Recommendation ITU -R P.2145 . If the instantaneous surface water vapour density and instantaneous integrated water vapour content are available concurrently, the instantaneous water vapour prediction method using the instantaneous integrated water vapour content should be used. 2.1 Slant path instantaneous water vapour gaseous attenuation prediction method 1 The predicted slant path instantaneous gaseous attenuation attributable to water vapour, 𝐴𝑤, is: 𝐴𝑤(𝑓,𝑝𝑠,𝑇𝑠,ρ𝑤𝑠)=γ𝑤(𝑓,𝑝𝑠,𝑇𝑠,𝑒𝑠)∙ℎ𝑤(𝑓) sinθ (35) 4 The terms exceedance probability and complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) are synonymous. 28 Rec."}
