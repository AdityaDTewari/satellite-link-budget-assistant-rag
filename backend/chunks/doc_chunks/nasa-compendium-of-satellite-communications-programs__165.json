Early work was with ionospheric and tropospheric scatter systems. The scatter 'concept was extended, under U. S. Air Force sponsorship, to the West Ford Program. Upon successfully concluding Project West Ford, the Laboratory's program aims were recast, in 1963, towards developing active communications satellite techniques. (1) This program, also under Air Force sponsorship, has made use of the original West Ford ground terminals as well as small mobile ground terminals to communicate through a series of Laboratory-developed satellites designated the Lncoln Experi­ mental Satellitew (LES). Lincoln Laboratory's active communications satellite program has been con­ cerned with the development and testing of new spacecraft and ground terminal tech­ niques having application to military command and control. (2) The objective of the spacecraft techniques investigations has centered on obtaining the maximum satellite effective radiated power for a given satellite mass. In agreement with this objective, research has been conducted on improved spacecraft power-generation systems, high efficiency spacecraft transmitters, high-gain spacecraft antennas, and spacecraft attitude stabilization and stationkeeping systems. The surface terminal techniques investigation has focused on developing methods of more effectively utilizing a given radio signal strength generated by a communications satellite. Areas of interest have included the development of efficient modulation-demodulation systems, random multiple access techniques having no stringent synchronization and control requirements, source signal encoding techniques that reduce required user data rates, low noise receiving systems, and simple antenna systems suitable for small"}
