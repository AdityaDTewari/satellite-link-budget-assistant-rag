S. caused interference problems. 4. Uplink Interference to Synchronous Satellites Measured on, LES-5 and LES-6. * Largest signalscome from TDDL sites- in the ait-defense system. Many other signals also detected. There was no piling-up of signals from many small comnmon-channel transmitters. Some portions of the bands scanned showed little activity. *Surface EIRPs as low as 50 to 100 watts detected on LES-5. LES-6 responded to EIRPs of 10 to 25 watts. Table 9-19.

Auroral Activity Nature of Results Aircraft antenna gain may vary from +9 to -15 dB over a hemisphere with elevation angle to satellite a major factor determining average gain. Surface vehicular or manpack terminal patterns affected by any metal object within 10 meters. Can be significant problem for multiple mobile termi­ nals accessing a hard limiting satellite since individual terminal uplink power levels showed about a +2 dB variation. Ability of individual terminal to effect entire system decreased dramatically as number of total accesses became large (i.e., about 10). In general, was not a significant problem. In case of FM voice signal and frequency hopping signal, however, intermodulation added a noticeable amount of noise to FM signal. Attenuation due to atmospheric moisture may vary between 0.5 to 1. 5 dB dependent upon the atmospheric path traversed by the signal. Locally heavy precipitation can add several more dB of loss. Encountered by aircraft. Two ray model for the most part valid in predicting results. Cir­ cularly polarized signals provide degree of protection since multipath fading on horizontally and vertically"}
