The demodulator takes the 50 to 90 MHz signal from the microwave receiver and demodulates it to the baseband. The PN equipment, AN/URC-55, can process the baseband of up to four voice channels with deviation factors of 2, 4, and 8. The digital modes of operation can process one digital channel at rates from 75 to 4800 bps in multiples of 75 times 2 An AN/FCC-55 multiplexer/demultiplexer performs the following func­ tions: a. Multiplies a total of 12 incoming user voice channels, a 0-to 4. 0-kHz orderwire, and the out-of-band TTYs into a 300-Hz to 52-kHz base­ band package. One TTY channel serves as a terminal orderwire, while the second TTY channel may serve as a TCF-to-TCF order­ wire. The 0-to 4-kHz channel is normally used as a voice com­ munications channel for the five-channel mode. The 0-to 4-kHz channel is the only channel used for voice communications with an AN/TSC-54. b. Demultiplexes the received 52-kHz baseband package into the indi­ vidual circuits as enumerated above. The prime power for the AN/FSC-9 earth terminals is supplied by commercial sources. The requirements for terminal operation are as follows: Voltage = 400 V, 3 Phase, 60 Hz and 700 kW 12-18 2. AN/MSC-46 The AN/MSC-46 is a mobile satellite communication terminal that oper­ ates with synchronous satellites. It provides an output power of 10 kW in the frequency range from 7900 to 8400 MHz to a 12-meter (40-foot) parabolic antenna. The receive frequency is in the range from 7250 to 7750 MHz. The system contains multiplex equipment with an installed capacity of four duplex voice channels and five duplex teletypewriter channels in a baseband of 0.3 to 20 kHz.
