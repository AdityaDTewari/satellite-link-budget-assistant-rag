The re- sultant receiving noise power density at the TDRS is -201.3 dBw/Hz-K. 5.1.5 Bit Energy to Noise Density Ratio For the forward link, with a probability of bit error of -510-5 and phase shift keying, a theoretical bit energy to noise density ratio of 9.6 dB is required. On the return link, convolutional encoding with an optimal decoder using soft decision (K=7, rate ) is assumed. The coding gain thus achievable is 5.5 dB. This results in a required bit energy to noise density ratio of 4.1 dB. (27) 5.1.6 Miscellaneous Losses An overall miscellaneous loss of 3 dB is assumed to account for polarization mismatch, transponder loss, demodulation loss, and pseudo- noise (PN) loss. 5-2 5.1.7 System Margin A margin of 3 dB over the threshold of bit energy to noise density ratio required to give a probability of bit error of l0-5 is considered necessary to assure confidence that the ultimate system performance is at least the specified value or better. 5.1.8 Link Budget Tables Table 5.1 represents a summary of the forward link calculations taking into account the assumptions made above. The resulting forward link rate is given in terms of the user satellite antenna gain. A similar set of calculations is summarized for the return link in Table 5.2 in which the return link rate is given in terms of the available user satellite EIRP. These link budget calculations were performed in the absence of RFI. 5-3 Table 5.1.
