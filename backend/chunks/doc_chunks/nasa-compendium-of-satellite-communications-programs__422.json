Figure 13-28 illustrates this experiment. 13.4.5.8 Television Relay Using Small Terminals (4 2 ) The purpose of this experiment is to test and evaluate the performance of small, low-cost ground terminals for the reception of quality color TV and television test signals in the Ultra High Frequency band (UHF) using ATS-6. Developing nations interested in the use of such a system for national educational TV purposes will be given an opportunity to participate in the tests and demonstrations. 13-109 €1 - *\"' . r 0 I ...
