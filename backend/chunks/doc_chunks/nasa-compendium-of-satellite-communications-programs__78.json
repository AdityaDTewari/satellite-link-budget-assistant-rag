NRL Space Communications Facility, Stump Neck, Maryland 3-16 3.5 EXPERIMENTS The premier objective of the Echo program was to evaluate the feasibility of employing satellite reflectors for global communications, and most of the planned experiments were directed towards that end. The second objective listed in Table 3-1 was accomplished through preflight statics tests, ballistic space tests, the TV system on the booster that monitored the deployment of Echo II, optical observations of both spheres over a period of time, and monitoring of reflected received signal levels over a period of time. Received signal level data was obtained in the planned, communi­ cations tests as well as in independent radar tracking operations. References 21 through 24 provide examples of the type of information analyses completed to verify that large lightweight structures of the Echo type can be successfully deployed and maintained in orbit. Accurate tracking of the Echo balloons was maintained throughout their lifetime. This gave the basis for accomplishing the third objective in Table 3-1, as well as allowing the'balloons to serve as accurate position location measurement references for remote geographic points. References 25 through 28 are examples of the types of analyses and conclusions that have been made possible by the extensive data on the Echo orbits. The major communications tests performed on Project Echo and a summary of their results are given in Table 3-8. (5)(8)(10)(22)(29)(30) Items 1 through 4 in the table were tests or analyses employed extensively on both Echo I and II, while the remaining listed tests were conducted mainly with Echo II alone. Results of the first three items, as well as optical data, indicated that Echo I was relatively smooth and spherical during its pressurized lifetime but developed wrinkles and flat areas during the"}
