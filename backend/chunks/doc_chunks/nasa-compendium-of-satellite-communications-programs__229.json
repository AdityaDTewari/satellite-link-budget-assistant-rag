In the past, these circuits had been carried by HF radio, but for manned space flights, improved communications were desired. Consequently, in the fall of 1965 the development for INTELSAT 11 hadbegun with-the primary goal of satisfying the NASA requirements; excess capacity was to be used for other commercial traffic. Because of the urgency to satisfy the NASA requirement, the INTELSAT II design evolved directly from that of INTELSAT I. Four INTELSAT H satellites were produced and launched as indicated in - Table 10-2. The first launch occurred 'inOctober 1966; 'but when the satellite's apogee motor malfunctioned, the spacecraft was left in a highly elliptical inclined orbit, making it unusable for full-time commercial operations. Subsequent launches in January and September 1967 successfully placed two satellites into operational serv­ ice over the Pacific Ocean. A March 1967 launch successfully supplemented the INTELSAT I satellite in operation over the Atlantic Ocean. With these three satel­ lites in place, commercial service was available over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The INTELSAT H satellites continued to meet international commercial com­ munications requirements successfully until third generation replacement satellites allowed them to be retired to the active reserve. The development of INTELSAT III was initiated in 1964 with a design study and followed 2 years later with the award of a contract for the de'sign, development, and fabrication of the necessary spacecraft. Eight INTELSAT Ill satellites were launched between September 1968 and July 1970 as indicated in Table 10-3. Launch failures in September 1968, July 1969, and July 1970 made three.of"}
