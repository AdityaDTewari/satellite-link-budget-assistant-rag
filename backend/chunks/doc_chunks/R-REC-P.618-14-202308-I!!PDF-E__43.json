The diurnal variation suggests that they increase in the daytime and decrease both in the early morning and the evening. 8 Calculation of long -term statistics for non -GSO paths The prediction methods described above were derived for applications where the elevation angle remains constant. For non -GSO systems, where the elevation angle is varying, the link availability for a single satellite can be calculated in the following way: a) calculate the minimum and maximum elevation angles at which the system will be expected to operate; b) divide the operational range of angles into small increments (e.g. 5 degrees wide); c) calculate the percentage of time that the satellite is visible as a function of elevation angle in each increment; 28 Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 d) for a given propagation impairment level, find the time percentage that the level is exceeded for each elevation angle increment; e) for each elevation angle increment, multiply the results of c) and d) and divide by 100, giving the time percentage that the impairment level is exceeded at this elevation angle; f) sum the time percentage values obtained in e) to arrive at the total system time percentage that the impairment level is exceeded. In the case of multi -visibility satellite constellations employing satellite path diversity (i.e. switching to the least impaired path), an approximate calculation can be made assuming that the spacecraft with the highest elevation angle is being used."}
