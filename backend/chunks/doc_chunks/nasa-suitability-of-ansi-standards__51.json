With these session profiles and details about the specific user/system interfaces, the relevant interfaceevents needed for the data extraction step ofthemeasurement process canbeidentified. Asystem level session profileforatypical ACTS LBRcall isillustrated inFigure I0, with the applicable primary and ancillary reference events identified. (see ANSI [1987] foradiscussion onancillary reference events.) Inthis session, theoriginating user initiates thecall, transfers data, and then disengages thecall. Nouser data oracknowledgments aretransferred from thedestination user back totheoriginating user. Figure 12illustrates in greater detail theACTS LBRsystem actions during asuccessful access request. Thesession begins with theoriginating user going \"off hook,\" thus issuing anAccess Request (primary reference event I)asthe interface event. The originating user receives a\"dial tone\" from thelocal ACTS CO,indicating that he/she may enter the destination user's address. The system processes the request, signaling the destihation user. The originating user receives a \"ring-back\" indicating that thedestination user isbeing signaled.There are noprimary reference events associated with this system event atthe originating user's interface. .I Thedestination user co_,_its tothesession byanswering thecall (going \"off hook\"),thus initiating reference event 2astheinterface event.The originating user receives theindication that thedestinatlon user iswilling tocommunicate.
