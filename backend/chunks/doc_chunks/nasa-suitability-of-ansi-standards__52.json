Asshown inFigure I0andingreater detail inFigure 13,after the last bit ofuser information has entered the system, the originating user issues adisconnect request (primary reference event 8),toitslocal interface (user goes \"onhook\" When thedestination user receives this last bitofthe 631989010985-073 641989010985-074 1989010985-075 user data, reference event7hasoccurred. Thedestination user then issues a disconnectrequesttoitslocal interface. Finally, after processing the disconnectrequests, the MCS issues a disconnectacknowledgment (primary reference event9)toboth user's earth stations. Ifthere isaneed toaccommodate additional circuitrequests, the MCS will develop and distribute anew BTP. Atthis time the system is available foranother call. Session profiles similar toFigures i0,12,and 13canbedrawn forthe ACTS LBRsystem high-volume trunk andbroadcast modes. Themain difference is the need for multiple access and disconnectrequests toestablish the extra circuits. Access requests canbeblocked atseveral locations intheACTS LBRsystem, thus contributing tothe Access Denial Probability and Access Outage Probability discussed inSection 4.2.1. Acause ofaccess blocking isshovel in Figure 14where theMCSignores thecircuit request. This would beduetothe system operating close tooratcapacity orthecircuit request message was received inerror and thus ignored. Inthis case theoriginating user will eventually goback \"onhook,\" abandoning thecall attempt iftheconnection is notmade. Another form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination earth station cannot process the call request. This woula bedue toequipment problems with its local COorlack ofavailable COtrunks. Asshown in Figure 15,when thedestination earth station isblocking thecall, itsends a circuit disconnect message totheMCS. Noindication ofblocking issent to theoriginating user, however, and they will eventually goback \"onhook,\" abandoning thecall attempt. Onefinal form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination user isbusy. Asshown inFigure 16,thedestination ACTS COnotes that thedestination user isbusy andsends a\"busy tone\" back totheoriginating user indicating user blocking (primary reference event 4). The originating user goes back \"on hook,\" initiating anormal circuit disconnect sequence. 4.3.4 ACTS LBRSystem Performance Experiment Configuration Figure 17shows theACTS LBRsystem"}
