The EIRP has a design minimum of 7 dBW. Each satellite had a beacon signature at its uiique telemetry frequency, in the 400-MHz area, for identification purposes. The repeater, shown in simplified block diagram form in Figure 12-5, is pri­ marily solid state. Amplification and limiting of the signal take place at intermediate frequencies. The mixing frequencies are derived from a basic oscillator and multi-: plier chains. The output of the IF amplifier/limiter is then summed with the beacon signal, up converted, and fed through the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and out to the transmitting antenna. A redundant TWTA automatically switches on in case the first TWTA fails. The switchover can occur only once. 12-8 SPGFigure 12-3. Phase I Satellite OF POOR 9UALI 12-9 I\"! Figure 12-4.

Characteristics of the satellites are summarized in Table 12-5. Table 12-6 indicates the initial voice channel capacity on particular duplex links as a function of terminal type on each end of the link. These figures are for two­ terminal access. The satellite frequency plan (depicted in Section 12.2), which was optimized to yield a minimum intermodulation Interference, allowed up to four RF accesses. 12.4 GROUND TERMINALS Four terminals were planned for the DSCS Phase 1. The shipboard program AN/SSC-3 was cancelled. The other three terminals will be described in this section. All terminals were"}
