Both terminals are basically similar in electronic design and have the same interfaces, redundancy and availability. Hence, Figure 17-6 is also the block diagram for the MT as well as the HT. A primary difference is that the AN/MSC-60 (MT) prototype terminal was equipped with a 5.5-meter (18-foot), aluminium, clover­ leaf antenna that is used with the AN/TSC-54. This increased the transportability of the terminal but decreased the G/T from 39 to 27 dB/ 0 K. It is anticipated that in production of the MT, the 5.5-meter (18-foot) cloverleaf antenna will be replaced by an 11-meter (35-foot) parabolic dish antenna. As shown in Table 17-5 the characteristics of the MT are based on an 11-meter (35-foot) antenna. The prototype specification change discussed for the AI/MSC-60 terminal procurement in Paragraph 17.4.4.1 also applies to AN/MSC-60 (MT) terminal procurement. 17.4.4.3 AN/TSC-86 Light Transportable (LT) This earth terminal has not yet been completely defined; however, the terminal is to be capable of rapid deployment. Table 17-5 presents typical parameters for the LT terminal, which will have one transmit and one receive converter. The terminal is intended for special user service and contingency, but, for the most part, is in­ tended for FD1VIA operation while the DSCS uses FDMA. When TDMA is introduced into the DSCS, either a channelized satellite repeater will have to be used or a special low-cost TDMA modem will have to be developed for the small user. 17-22 17.4.5 Other New Equipment The Phase I AN/TSC-54 terminals were equipped with only ohe voice channel.
