S. -Supplied \"Hotline\" Earth Station \"In October, 1972, the U. S. Army Satellite Communications Agency awarded a contract to the Radiation Division of Harris-Intertype Corporation to build the com­ plete Earth Station on a 15-acre site at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The USA Earth Sta­ tion will be this countryts part of a link between the United States and the Soviet Union using the USSR's Molniya H satellite system. \"The DCL (Direct Communication Link) Earth Station consists of two identical and independent communications systems providing simultaneous transmission and reception of C-Band, FM modulated signals through 60-foot tracking and communica­ tions antennas. Both communications systems interface via baseband processing equipment with government telephone cables that complete the Washington-Moscow connection. Transmission frequency and power are controlled automatically using as a reference a pilot carrier transmitted through the satellite from a USSR Earth Sta­ tion. Both DCL antennas have the full hemispherical angular coverage and precision tracking capability needed to direct their narrow beams towards satellites that have eccentric 12-hour orbits. During the daily 8-hour period in which each satellite is mutually visible between Washington and Moscow, -its pilot signal is autotracked by the two DCL antennas. In addition to the two communications systems--including the transmitting, re­ ceiving and antenna subsystems--there are the ancillary subsystems that serve the Earth Station as a whole [see Figures 11-11 and 11-123. These ancillary subsys­ tems include (1) a dual programmer subsystem; (2) a control, monitor, and alarm and (4) the earth station building. ,(I)subsystem; (3) a prime power subsystem; 11-22 ANCILLARY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM \"B\"COMMUNICATION SYSTEM \"A\" --- ---- SUBSYSTEMSSIF o ,I11I I jIANTENNA ANTENNA SUSSE PRIME jSUBSYSTEM POWER"}
