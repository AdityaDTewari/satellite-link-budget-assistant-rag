Subliming solid Jets also available for satellite inversion if stabilization occurs at 1800 from desired attitude. 13-43 POj PA 2 6 A separate unrelated millimeter wave receiver and transmitting system were provided to aid in evaluating propagation at two different frequencies. The trans­ mitting system included a primary and secondary transmitter operating at the same frequency. Additionally, a capability existed to receive and detect a TV signal to be used to modulate the L-Band"}
