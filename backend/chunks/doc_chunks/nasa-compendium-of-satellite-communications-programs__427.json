This information will have further appli­ cation to studies of the steady-state shape of earth. All the tracking and data relay information collected will be valuable for the future transition from a totally ground based tracking system to a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (T&DRSS) under investigation for the late 1970s. This system would employ two synchronous orbit spacecraft to relay command, tracking, and telemetry data between a few centrally located groimnd stations and multiple spacecraft in low earth orbit. Extensive networks of tracking stations have been established around the world in present tracking techniques to obtain relatively complete global tracking coverage for low-orbit spacecraft. Such networks are costly in terms of the instrumentation and the manpower involved in the operation. Also, because of the geographical 13-114 location of the stations, these networks are unable to provide adequate coverage of spacecraft in some orbits. The T&DRSS would help solve many of these problems. Such a system could perform many of the key functions of the ground-based tracking stations, thus reduc­ ing the instrumentation and manpower requirements. In addition, each synchronous­ orbit spacecraft in the tracking system would be able to track a particular spacecraft for a much longer period of time than an earth-based station. This would reduce the difficulties involved in sequential tracking by multiple ground stations. For either the Nimbus-F or the GEOS-C experiment, ATS-6 will be commanded first by the ATS ground station at Rosman, N, C., to point at and lock onto one of the spacecraft orbiting beneath it. (42) The R&RR system uses a series of tones to modulate an RF carrier; the modu­ lated carrier is transmitted from the ground station to ATS-6, then down to Nimbus, up to ATS-6,"}
