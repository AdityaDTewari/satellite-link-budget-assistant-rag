The propagation time isthe same forall types Aand Bcommunication satellite systems.Themodulation time isthetime required to\"clock\" thedata block into thesystem; itdepends onthechannel transmission rate andblock length. User Information BitTransfer Rate TheUser Information BitTransfer Rate, often referred toasthroughput, is theuser bit rate thesystem supports. This parameter isthesame asthebit rate (Rb) discussed intheappendix.Since there are nostore and forward capabilities with type AandBcommunication satellites, there arenothrough- putrate conversions; thus, thesystem input rate equals thesystem output rate asshown bycase IofFigure 2. Transfer Denial Probability Transfer denial occurs when the transmission quality ofthe link has degraded toapoint that the Bit Error Probability orUser Information Bit Transfer Rate isworse than aspecified threshold (see Section 2). However, fordedicated point-to-point systems, theUser Information BitRate isconstant and thus would not contribute totransfer denial.Increased Pedue tosun outages andrain fades are theprimary cause.Sunoutages occur twice ayear when the satellite eclipses the sun during the spring and autumn equinox, causing theearth station system noise temperature torise, thus increasing the Pe. Sunoutages last about twotosixl_inutes adayforatwo- tofour-day period.Rain fades are due tothe increased propagation loss and thus increased Pecaused bylocal rain storms.Thelimiting case oftransfer denial probability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., thesystem is \"down\" because ofanequipment failure. TheTransfer Denial Probability canbe thought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. There are distinct advantages inusing the ANS X3.102 performance parameters for quantifying type Aand Bcommunication satellite system performance. First,byusing these parameters,theuser isable toevaluate how well these satellite systems meet their requirements, how various configurations orfactors (e.g., QPSK modulation vsBPSK modulation) affect the 261989010985-036 performance, andhow these satellite systems compare with other transmission systems oradvanced switching communication satellites. Secondly, these parameters canbeused tospecify theuser's requirements, giving theservice provider astarting point forthelink design. And finally, these parameters are relatively easy toobtain. Ifthelink budget has been calculated, the Bit/Block Error Probability andUser Information BitTransfer Rate areknown. TheTransfer Denial"}
