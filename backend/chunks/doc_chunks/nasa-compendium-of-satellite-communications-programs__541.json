It was first used for commercial service on January 11, 1973, pro­ viding coverage throughout Canada as illustrated in Figure 18-2. A second satellite, ANIK H, was launched on April 26, 1973, and was positioned at 1090 W longitude. ANIK I and ANIK II have the same communications packages. Design features are summarized in Table 18-1. A third satellite has been procured and is intended to be used initially as an earth spare. However, if neither of the in-orbit satellites fails; the third satellite will be launched early in 1975 and will be positioned at 1040 W lon­ gitude to accommodate plans for expansion of the system. The ANIK is capable of providing 12 television channels or various mixes of TV, data, and voice. The initial communication services include three RF channels for TV distribution, two RF channels for telephone message traffic between Vancouver and Toronto, one RF channel for North-South communications using the FDM/FM/FDMA technique, and one RF channel for thin route application using the A-mode/PSK/FDMAU technique. Early in 1974, the eighth transponder was assigned to a two-carrier FM/FDMA system which provides 240 circuits between Allan Park, Ont. (G/T = 37 dB/0 K) and Harrietsfield, N. S. (G/T = 31 dB/°K). This message link carries a portion of the traffic from the CANTAT II Trans-Atlantic Cable System. Subsequently, this FDMA link will be re­ placed by a double-access TDMA system which will increase the capacity to 400 circuits. 18.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system, in its overall configuration, includes spin-stabilized satellites in geostationary orbit; tracking, telemetry and command facilities; a control center and numerous earth stations of several different types. As a multi-purpose telecommuni­ cations system providing television, radio, voice, data and"}
