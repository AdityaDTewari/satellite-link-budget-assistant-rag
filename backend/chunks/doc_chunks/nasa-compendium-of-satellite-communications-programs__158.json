The demonstrations also displayed that satellite time delay and echo could be overcome. However, to accomplish the latter it was found necessary to maintain incoming conventional phone line levels at -15 dBm or above with the 8-11 equipment employed. The time delay presented few psychological problems even with unexpectant speakers. The communications performance experiments described in Table 8-7 are de­ fined and their basic results presented in Table 8-8. (3) (4) (15) (19) Results indicated are for half duplex operation. The Syncom II television transmissions involved a wide­ band FM modulator at Fort Dix. At the receive end, the Bell Telephone Laboratory's Andover terminal was outfitted with a maser preamplifier operating at the Syncom frequencies. The Syncom HI Japan to California television test was the 1964 TV cover­ age of the Olympics. Television p-p signal to weighted rms noise ratios would be about 8 dB better than the unweighted values indicated in the table. This means signals were quite viewable but not of high quality. The communications technical characteristic measurements noted in Table 8-7 are described in Table 8-9. (3) (4) In addition to the tests mentioned, the frequency response of the 50-kHz transponder on Syncom HI was measured. It displayed an 87­ kHz bandwidth at the 3-dB points. Further, measurements of the Faraday rotation of the 137-MHz telemetry signal from Syncom Inl provided considerable data on the electron content of the ionosphere. (20) (21) 8.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The communications system operations on Project Syncom displayed that highly reliable synchornous satellite communications systems were feasible. During the initial experimental period of the program, operational responsibility for the Syncom satellites rested"}
