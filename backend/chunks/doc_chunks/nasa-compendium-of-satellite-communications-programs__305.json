The initial objectives of shown in Table 12-1. (4)(5)the program are No ground commands were permitted in developing the hardware for the DSCS Phase I-satellite. However, simplicity and conservatism were stressed in the de­ sign of the communication subsystem. Thus, there was no active control of position or orientation of the satellite either during deployment or during the life of the sys­ tem. The period immediately after the first launch was used for system testing be­ tween deployed terminals. In particular, a two-channel full duplex link capability between two AN/MSC-46 terminals was demonstrated. In December 1966, emergency operational links were established between Hawaii-RVN and Philippines-RVN; in July 1967, the Pacific network was placed in operational status, and integration of DCS was begun. Thus, designed as an R&D system, the DSCS almost immediately 12-1 became an operational system, though some R&D was continued in other portions of the system. Table 12-1. DSCP Phase I Number Objectives 1 Conduct system research, development, testing and evaluation to determine operational compatibility and utility of the Initial Defense Communication Satellite System (IDCSS) to meet user requirements 2 Establish a research and development R&D communications satellite system in being, designed for the most part to be directly convertible and expandable to an operational system through integration and compatibility with DCS and thereby papable of providing service to specified users of the National Communications System (NCS) 3 Provide an.emergency capability for supplementing the De­ fense Communications System (DCS) and improving its assurance of provision of the minimal essential survival com­ munications for the National Military Command and Control purposes The DSCS Phase I augments the conventional communication methods such as radio, land and submarine cable, microwave, and tropospheric scatter. It provides near-synchronous communication satellites to relay"}
