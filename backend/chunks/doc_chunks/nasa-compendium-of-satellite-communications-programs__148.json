(1) Project Syncom was initiated as a joint NASA/DOD development in August, 1961. The major objectives of this program were to develop the capability of launching satellites into earth synchronous orbits and to demonstrate the utility of this type of orbit for satellite communications. (2) Three spacecraft were launched during the course of completing Project Syncom, as indicated in Table 8-1. (4) (5) (6) Syncom I went totally silent during the firing of its apogee motor in an attempt to complete injection into a synchronous inclined orbit. Subsequent optical sitings revealed that the desired orbit was attained to partially satisfy the program objectives. Syncom II was successfully launched into a synchronous inclined orbit and initially positioned over Brazil at 550 W. longitude. It was later moved to a final location over the Indian Ocean. Numerous experiments and demonstrations were conducted to satisfy all program objectives. Subsequent to the initial successful operations with Syncom 11, the Thrust Augmented Delta rocket became available, making possible further improvements in the synchronous orbit injection technology. This launch vehicle allowed Syncom III to be successfully placed into a synchronous equatorial orbit (i. e., a geostationary orbit). The satellite was positioned over the Pacific International Date Line and additional communications measurements and demonstrations were conducted. With all of the Syncom programs' experimental objectives attained, Syncoms II and III were turned over to DOD in early 1965 to provide an operational communications capability serving the Far East, Pacific Ocean and Western United States. This continued until the first worldwide militarr satellite communications system became operational and was able to assume the communications load"}
