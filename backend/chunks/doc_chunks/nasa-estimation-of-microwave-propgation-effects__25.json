These effects maybeconsidered typical ofeffects observed overinland (continental) locations. Forsites located nearcoastal areas, islands, atsea,orin tropical regions, thefocusing losses mayincrease somewhat fromthese levels duetoincreased surface refractivity anddifferent near-surface refractive index gradients (seealsoYokoi, 1970). Focusing losses should beindependent offrequency overtherange of1to100GHzwhere water vapor iscontributing totherefractive profile. Theeffects duetodry airalone andathigher frequencies havenotbeenestimated butshould belesssignificant. 2.4.3 Procedure Toestimate thesystemmargins foratmospheric multipath andspread- ingloss atlowelevations (below 5degrees), thefollowing steps maybe used: Step 1-Obtain theelevation angle ranges ofconcernforearth-to- space path. Step2-Choose percentage oftimes tobeexceeded forselected system fademargin (e.g., 95%,99%or99.9%). Step3-Enter curves ofFigures 29athrough d(forthefoursea- sons) atappropriate elevation curve andpercentages toobtain atable of fading depths Lfade (dB)versus season andpercentage exceeded. Step 4-Theeffect offrequency onfading depth maynowbeesti- mated (attheusers option): _dB=I0loglO[Tf°.-_3] where: AdB=correctiontofading depth duetofrequency different than7.5GHz f=operating frequency (GHz)op 57 Thisvalue maybeadded toallthelosses obtained inthetable ofStep3. Itisnotsuggested toexercise thisoption forlarge frequency depar- tures from7.3GHzduetolackofsupporting measurements. Step5-Obtain focusing lossLfocus(dB) fromFigure 32atthe pathelevation angle. Thisvalue maybeconsidered aconstant tobe added without regard topercentage oftimeorseason. Step6-Themaximum ofStep4andlosses fromStep5maybe retained forthedetermination oftotal losses andsystem margins. 2.5Radome Attenuation Though radomes ideally shelter anantenna structure fromenviron- mental exposure, somesmall degrading effects occur duetotheradome's transmission losswhich furtherdegradesduringperiods ofrainorwet- nessontheradome. 2.5.1DryConditions Thetransmission losses typically experienced duetoaradome over anantenna varywithmaterial, thickness, andoperating frequency. Typically, theone-way losses (Skolnik, 1970) aredesigned tobeafew tenths ofadB(0.2to0.5dBtypical).

Generally, losses exceeding 1dBareconsidered non- optimum designs. 2.5.2WetConditions Afactor often notadequately taken intoaccount insystem design is theadditional system margin required duetoawetradome, Lwet.This effect isproduced byathinlayer ofwater overtheradome material due toasteady rainfall ordewcondition.
