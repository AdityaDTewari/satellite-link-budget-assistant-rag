However, the accuracy of this procedure has not been established. 2.2.1.3.2 Long -term frequency scaling of rain attenuation statistics If reliable attenuation data measured at one frequency are available, the following empirical formula giving an attenuation ratio directly as a function of frequency and attenuation may be applied for frequency scaling on the same path in the frequency range 7 to 55 GHz: ( )),,( 1 1 21 2121 /A HA A − = (24) where: ()242 101 fff−+=  (25) 55.0 115.0 1 23– 121 ) ()/( 1012.1),,( A A H    =  (26) A1 and A2 are the equiprobable values of the excess rain attenuation at frequencies f1 and f2 (GHz), respectively. Frequency scaling of attenuation from reliable long-term measured attenuation data, rather than long-term measured rain data, is preferred. 2.2.2 Seasonal variations – worst month System planning often requires the attenuation value exceeded for a time percentage, pw, of the worst month. The following procedure is used to estimate the attenuation exceeded for a specified percentage of the worst month. Step 1 : Obtain the annual time percentage, p, corresponding to the desired worst -month time percentage, pw, by using the equation specified in Recommendation ITU-R P.841 and by applying any adjustments to p as prescribed therein. Step 2 : For the path in question obtain the attenuation, A (dB), exceeded for the resulting annual time percentage, p, from the method of § 2.2.1.1, or from measured or frequency -scaled attenuation statistics. This value of A is the estimated attenuation for pw per cent of the worst month. Curves giving the variation of worst -month values from their mean are provided in Recommendation ITU-R P.678. 2.2.3 Variability in space and time of statistics Precipitation attenuation distributions measured on the same path at the"}
