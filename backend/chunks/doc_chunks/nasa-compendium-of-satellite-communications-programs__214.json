Locally heavy precipitation can add several more dB of loss. Encountered by aircraft. Two ray model for the most part valid in predicting results. Cir­ cularly polarized signals provide degree of protection since multipath fading on horizontally and vertically polarized components is relatively independent. Fading occurs primarily for eleva­ tion angles between 0 & 200i Over water and ice cyclic fades vary between I & 10 dB with 5 dB being most common. Over land cyclic fades decrease to 2 to 3 dB with occasional random fades of 5 to 10 dB. Flights over mountains dis­ play no multipath. Can be up to 3 dB for operation with circularly polarized satellite. Circularly polarized aircraft antenna losses will, in general, vary with elevation angle to satellite. Occurred at rate 100 times faster than predictable by 2-ray multipath in del. Both enhancement and fading occurred. Was frequency selective. Ocurred only over water at look angles greater than 250 when operating within 300 of equator. Did not appear cyclic. Limited data indicated low probability of occurrence for operation above 100 elevation angle in Temperate Zone L+200 to + 650 latitude). Can cause fades up to 20 dB. Polar Zone scintillation also observed. 4 to 6 dB of loss encountered by vehicular and man­ pack terminals. Changing moisture content causes variations. Limited data indicated little or no effect. 9-45 D)RIGINAL PAGE IS DF POOR QUALITY The TATS performance is about 2.5 dB at 2.4 kbps and 4.5 dB at 75 bps above theoretical. This performance was for production model modems optimized for the 2.4-kbps data rate. Lincoln Laboratory prototype TATS mode'ms achieved much nearer to theoretical performance at both data-rates. 'Production TATS modems also displayed poor operational reliability. The triple diversity modem displayed"}
