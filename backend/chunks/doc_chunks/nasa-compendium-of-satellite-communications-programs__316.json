The receive frequency is in the range from 7250 to 7750 MHz. The system contains multiplex equipment with an installed capacity of four duplex voice channels and five duplex teletypewriter channels in a baseband of 0.3 to 20 kHz. Auxiliary wideband baseband inputs 0.3 to 500 kHz or 0.3 to 252 kHz (up to 60 voice channels) can be accommodated. To facilitate operations, an additional teletypewriter channel is used as an orderwire. Figure 12-8 is a simplified block dia­ gram of the AN/MSC-46. The AN/MSC-46 terminal is housed in a cargo van, a maintenance van, an operations control van (OCV), and an inflatable radome. Power is fur­ nished by three diesel generators of 100 kW each, or local commercial power may be used. The complete terminal, including the disassembled antenna and radome, can be transported in C-124, C-130E, and C-5 air­ craft. The total weight Is approximately 51,700 kgm (114,000 pounds). After arrival on site, a crew of eight trained men is required to erect the terminal. The operational configuration is presented in Figure 12-9. The AN/MSC-46 terminal uses a 12-meter (40-foot) diameter Cassegrain type antenna to track medium altitude to synchronous communication satel­ lites. The reflector is mounted on a transportable pedestal which uses a tripod ground support. The RF room, which contains the receiver and high-powered amplifier, is located directly behind the main reflector. The antenna feed is a four-horn (modified) monopulse, circularly polarized feed that Is used for both transmitting and receiving. The feed provides sum, elevation error, and aximuth error, signals to the RF receiver for communication signal processing and antenna tracking.
