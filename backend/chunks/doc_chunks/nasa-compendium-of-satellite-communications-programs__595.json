CTS Experiments (6 of 8) Organization Country Objective Ontario Educational Canada In what is essentially a user-oriented project, Communications the OECA will provide assistance to Indian Authority (OECA) communities in Northwestern' Ontario to develop voice and video programs. These will be used in an experiment to determine the educational and social implications of the use of satellite transmissions. Province of Manitoba, Canada With a view to the future decentralization of Management Committee government data processing, the Manitoba of Cabinet Government Computer Centre is investigating various aspects of terminal-to-computer and computer-to-computer communications. University of Toronto Canada In this experiment, the satellite will be used to provide a link between two radio telescopes (one in Canada and one in the U. S.) to form a radio interferometer which will provide information on the structure and position of astronomical radio sources. McMaster University Canada The purpose of this experiment is to study the performance of.modems for high-rate digital data transmission via .CTS. University of Western Canada This experiment will test the value to native Ontario people in the Yellowknife Area in the Northwbst Territories of access to a large computer in the south using their own language.
