(7) Performance potential of sequential decoding as applied to satellite links was displayed. (8) Frequency hopping was shown to provide satisfactory random access and resistance to multipath and RF1. (9) Demonstrated feasibility of autonomous stationkeeping and station changing. Intelsat (1) Demonstrated that time delay and echo are not serious problems in commercial communications through synchronous satellites. (2) Displayed single conversion linear satellite repeaters. (3) Employed first satellite antennas having beam­ widths considerably narrower than required for earth coverage. (4) Developed techniques for control and operation of a high reliability operational system. (5) Developed and demonstrated PCM-PSK-TDMA trunking systems. (6) De­ veloped PCM-PSK-FDMA single voice channel system (i. e., SPADE). Molnyia (1) Demonstrated feasibility of operational system in northern hemisphere using 12 hour highly elliptical orbits. (2) Displayed electric motor driven, flywheel stabilized spacecraft with earth tracking antennas and capability of orienting solar panels towards sun.

Summary of Major Contributions (3 of 3) Primary Results (1) Demonstrated operational system composed of large number of simple random orbit satellites can be established and maintained. (2) Displayed feasibility of wide band high data rate (1 Mbps) satellite transmissions of high resolution imagery. (3) Demonstrated a limited degree of success in initially establishing and maintaining gravity gradient stabilization but encountered numerous unexplained difficulties. (4) Displayed operational jam resistant pseudonoise modems. (1) Demonstrated feasibility and potential of electronic despinning using phased arrays. (2) Displayed feasibility and attractiveness of mechanically despun antennas. (3) Showed that single-sideband frequency division multiplexing on uplink and phase modulation by the composite received signal on downlink is practical means of multiple access. (4) Demonstrated feasibility of VHF satel­ lite communications among small mobile terminals. (5) Provided data on milli­ -Eeter wave propagation. (6) Gave initial"}
