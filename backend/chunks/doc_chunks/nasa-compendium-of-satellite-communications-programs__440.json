While the ATS-6 is in view of the Unit6d States, data collected with this radiom­ eter will be recorded on magnetic tape and selected frames will be supplied to the Principal Investigator in near real-time. Data reduction and analysis will be accom­ plished by means of a combination of digital computer and photo imaging techniques. (42) 13.4.5.16.2 Cesium Bombardment Ion Engine Experiment The experiment flight hardware consists of two identical cesium ion thrusters, each weighing about 16 kil6grams (35 pounds), and requiring less than 150 watts of power. -3 Each unit has a thrust capability of 4.45 x 10 newtons (one one-thousandth of a pound). 13-125 The objective is to verify and obtain operational data on the,use of an ion micro­ thruster electric propulsion system for station keeping and attitude ,control maneuvers. (4 13.4.5.16.3 Advanced Thermal Control Flight Experiment This experiment will evaluate the performance of several new thermal control devices for stabilizing the temperature of spacecraft components.' Simpler and more effective thermal control techniques for future space applications could result from the knowledge gained. In essence, this experiment is designed to control the temperature of an equip­ ment package subjected to heat dissipated from a simulated electrical component during a normal duty cycle. Solar energy will be used a§ the energy source in lieu of an electrical component. ., .- Solar energy will be collected while the spacecraft is in sunlight by an absorber located on the east side of the EVM. This energy will be transmitted through a one-way thermal diode-(heat pipe) to the equipment package, which houses a heat reservoir consisting of a container of' paraffin. Once the paraffin melts at 2950 K (720 F), the excessive"}
