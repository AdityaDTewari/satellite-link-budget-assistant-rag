After passing through a parametric-diode up-converter and output . duplexer, the signals are amplified in a two-stage TWT amplifier. The first TWT operates In a linear mode, while the second TWT operates in a saturated mode. A ferrite isolator is employed between TWTs for matching. For duplex telephony, the power output is 14 watts per channel; for television, the output power is 40 watts, the maximum available. Design lifetime of the later Molniya-1 spacecraft was about 2 years as compared to 1 year for initial versions. 11.4 GROUND TERMINALS Selected characteristics for the earth terminals utilizing the Molniya-1 satel­ lites are presented in Table 11-3. The ground terminal antennas (transmitting and receiving) are 15-meter (50-foot) diameter paraboloids with Cassegrain feeds. They are mounted on rotating units per­ mitting a tracking accuracy of a few angular minutes; tracking is either preprogramed or self-tracking. To decrease losses in the feeder waveguide equipment, bildings are constructed in direct proximity to the rotating units. The parametric amplifiers of the O receiver as well as the receiver duplex and directional coupler have been Installed In an antenna cabin behind the primary reflector. For the output of the parametric am­ plifier, the received IF signal is fed to the receiving equipment located In the building. The high frequency power output from the transmitter building is delivered to the an­ tenna feed along a waveguide through the rotating junction. The transmitting unit consists of an exciter, frequency modulator, power am­ plifier and supply, monitor, and heat exchanger. The transmitter itself is a 5-kw multlcavity klystron. The video bandwidth available for the television mode Is 5 MHz. For more efficient transmission of television and telephone signals, there are stand­ ard preselection systems.
