FOREWORD TOT.._ESECOND EDITION TheNASA Propagation Effects Handbook for Satellite Systems•.•. Design was prepared bythe Space Engineering andCommunications !_i• Systems Division, ORI Incorporated, for NASA Headquarters. The iii_:_i Handbook has evolved through several years ofdevelopment atNASA !:i%i and represents the most uptodate information onpropagation !!:i•_ impairments onsatellite linksoperating ati0-i00 GHz. _- The need for aconcise systems design oriented Handbook for this _/:i<_ frequency band has become evident ascommunications satellite _•!_•i_i•itechnology moves into the frequencybands above i0GHzfor fixed ii! serviceanddirect broadcast applications. Severaldomestic !•i•••_.• systems inthe United States and Canadaare already orsoon will •. beoperating inthe Kuband (14/11GHz). Internationally, •i... Intelsat Vand OTS-2 presently operate inthe Kuband and satellite systems under development for Europe and Japan will include Kuband capabilities. NASA ispresently developing the technology for Kaband (30/20 G_z) satellite applications requirements for the 1990's. Japan, with its CSsatellite asaprecursor, and Italy, are also investigating satellite developments for application toKaband systems. .. The Handbookwas conceived asanevolving document, which is updatedperiodically toprovide updatesandadditional recent developments. The first edition was published inMarch 1980 _ after anextensive peer review byboth propagation specialists and satellite system designers. This second edition contains several modifications and new material isincluded throughout, particularly inthe areas ofrain attenuation modeling, link performance allocations, and availability. Asubject index is also included for the first time, toallow amore efficient access tothe material inthe Handbook. Comments orrecommendations for additional areastobecovered, orfor ways ofimproving the presentation ofmaterial, are always welcome.
