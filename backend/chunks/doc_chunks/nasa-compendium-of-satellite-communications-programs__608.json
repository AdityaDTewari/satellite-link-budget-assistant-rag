RCA Alaska Communications, Inc. (RCA Alascom) will offer public message service and private line services to Alaska. Alaska is one of the key aspects of the RCA Domsat program. 20.4.2 System Description The system operates \"inthe 6/4 GHz band with each satellite providing 24 channels with an RF bandwidth of about 34 MHz each. Orthogonal polarizations with 12 channels per polarization enable the reuse of frequency in the 500 MHz band. The earth terminals will be of various sizes having antenna diameters varying from. 5 to. 30 meters (15 to 98 feet). Separate beam coverage areas are provided' for: (1) the continental United States (CONUS) and Alaska, and (2) Hawaii; these are shown in Figure 20-12. 20.4.3 RCA Spacecraft The Satcom satellite is specifically designed for the Delta 3914 Launch Vehicle and will provide 24 RF channels of 34 MHz usable bandwidth and 32 dBW EIRP each. The Satcom will employ the new techniques of three-axis stabilized and oriented solar panels to generate sufficient DC power.
