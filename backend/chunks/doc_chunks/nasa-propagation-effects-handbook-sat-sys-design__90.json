Itisinteresting tonote,however,that allfive locations are located insimilar temperate continental rain climate regions. Tworainfall region models areavailable inCCIR publications, that ofRice andHolmberg (1973) describedinCCIR Rep563-I(1978a), andthe Global Precipitation Model •ofCrane(lgSO), presented inCCIR Document P/IOS-E (1978b). Both place the five locations discussed here inthesameclimate zones. Thus, attenuation prediction models based onthetwoabove referenced procedures would yield similar attenuation distributions forallfive locations. Such asimilarity isnotevident forthemeasured annual distributionspresented here forthose five locations. Figure 5.4-7presentsdistributionsatthree locationswhere long-term measurements, extending from 29to36monthsduration, were available. Thelong-term distributions aremuch smoother than theindividual 12month distributions, andthecurves forHolmdel andGreenbeltarevery similar, particularly intheregion from .01to.0025g, which isthearea of great interest forsystemdesign margin criteria. Theresults point outthe desirability formulti-year continuous measurements intheevaluation ofrain attenuation effects oncommunications system performance.
