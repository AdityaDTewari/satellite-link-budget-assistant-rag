Incommunication system design, the (shortterm) biterror rate orbiterror probability istaken asaparameter ofanalysis andpreliminarydesign. Finalperformance estimates must, however, take into account both thenominal BERperformance, andsome consideration ofoutages. Thequalitative relationships among thevarious criteria areshown inFigure 7.2-1. Notice that thefundamental, or user-requirement- oriented, criteria areontheright side ofthediagram, yet thecorrect logical path foranalysis isfrom left toright. Thus, analysis isemployed todemonstrate that asetofsystem andenvironmental conditions will meet theperformance requirements. ,= BitError =I SNR -Eb/No '_P_ab-iiity _ OutageProbability _ andLength Figure7.2-1Block Error Probability u Throughput IMessage Delivery Delay Data System Performance 358 7.2.3 Analo9 Transmission Performance Theestablishment ofperformancecriteria foranalog systems isa complex issue. Transmission system criteria areusually defined onan end-to-end, reference circuit basis. Ifthesatellitesystem isonly a portion ofthis end-to-end path, asub-allocation must bemade tothe satellite segment. Also, when thesystem isusedforrelay ofmultichannel voice trunks, theconversion from baseband (voice channel) performance criteria totheradio frequency criteria (i.e., C/N) involves assumptions about channel loadingandmodulation parameters.
