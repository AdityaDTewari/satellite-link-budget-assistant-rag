Uh and SHF teampack terminals in various Pacific Island locations,Used FM voice channel employing specialdata modes Using CW transmission to measure parameters. Ground, ship, submarine and aircraft mounted antennas were tested, Standard tests were used to determine the characteristics Single satellite access voice link at UHF and at SHF Single transmitting modem configuration using every UHF, SHM and cross-strap mode capable of supporting TATs modem, Single transmitting modem configuration using UHF from ground transmitter to aircraft terminal. A ground receive terminal used to provide a reference data base. Up to five transmitting modem signals are combined and transmitted. The test Was performed using the satellite ed in a back-to-back setup. 6-channel pCM communications using TO- 660 and the 288-kbps"}
