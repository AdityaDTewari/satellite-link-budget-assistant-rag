Thevariance ofthereceived signal amplitude iscalculatedusing theexpression inSection 6.6.2.2.Thefull half-power beamwidth Bindegrees is70X/da=70c/fda= (70)(3xIoBm/sec)/(2B.56x109sec'1)(4.6m) =0.16 degrees.

Thepower spectrum density ofthefluctuations decreases at26.5 dB/decade (see Figure 6.6-6). Ifoneconsiders some lower frequency cutoff fortheamplitude fluctuations (say0.1Hz) thefluctuation power atIHzis ontheaverage 26.5 dBbelow thevalue of0.1Hz. Only 10%ofthetime will• the1Hz fluctuation power beonly 10dBbelow the0.1Hz fluctuation power. Clearly, most ofthefluctuation power forclear airfluctuations isatthe lowfrequencies (less than 1Hz). 6.6.6.2 Phase andAngle-Of-Arrival Variations. Phasefluctuations are estimated from themodel ofMuchmore andWheelon (1955) presented inSection 6.6.3. Data quotedinMuchmore andWheelon indicate typical values for_= 60m_200feet andAN2=1/2. Thus £A--_-= 30meters. Forafinite circular antenna (see Section 9.6)of4.6mdiameter, themsphase delay fluctuation is0.85 radians =48degrees.ForaCno= 10-14,thephase ripple fluctuation across theantenna isverysmall. Theestimate oftheangle'of-arrival fluctuations inradians (see Section 9.6.4) iscalculated tobe3.2x10-5radians =1.8x10-3 degrees. This isasmall number compared to0.1__66 degree half-power beamwidth oftheantenna.
