Aboard the CTS angular momentum will be stored in a 3,740 rpm, 20 Nms (15 ft-lb-sec) fixed momentum wheel whose spin axis is parallel to the spacecraft pitch axis. Pitch con­ trol is obtained by varying the speed of the wheel. Roll and yaw attitude errors are corrected by operation of off-set hydrazine thrusters which create a component of con­ trol torque in the yaw and roll axes. This results in gyroscopic precession which, within one quarter orbit, removes the yaw and roll errors. 19.2.5 Electrical Power Subsystem Prior to deployment of the extendible solar arrays the; CTS will be powered by two Ni-Cd batteries and body-mounted solar cells. There are approximately 5070, 2 x 2 cm, 8mil thick, silicon solar cells in the body mounted array which are capable of delivering a power output of 77 watts at 29 volts. The main power array consists of 25,272 solar cells mounted on two sails. Each sail consists of 30 panels, 26 active and 4 blank, on flexible Kapton substrate, with a cell packing efficiency of 0. 93. The cells are negative on positive (N/P), 1 to 2 ohm/cn 8 nmil thick, 2 x 2 cm with 4 mil cerium doped cover glass. The cells have an initial efficiency of 10. 5% but the total power output is expected to be reduced by 160 after two years as a result of radiation damage. The main array will provide a total of 1260 watts at beginning of life in two buses. The experiments bus will have 1040 watts at 76 volts while the housekeeping bus will have 220 watts at 28 volts.
