The contingency terminals will include 12 chan­ nels of self-contained multiplex equipment but will be able to handle a baseband con­ sisting of up to 72 channels. 17-18 17.4.4 New Terminals 17.4.4.1 AN/MSC-60, Heavy Transportable (HT) Table 17-5 presents major characteristics of the AN/MSC-60. The prototype model AN/MSC-60 earth terminal shown in Figure 17-5 is a transportable terminal designed as a seifixed installation, which requires a prepared site and about 45 days to install. Figure 17-6 is a block diagram of an HT/MT prototype terminal. The model has been developed by the Philco-Ford Corporation under a contract to the Army SATCOM Agency. The prototype terminal has completed acceptance testing and is currently operational. The production specification for HT will provide for: * A fixed plant terminal installation that would eliminate the need for vans. * Parallel operation of the two traveling wave tube (TWT) power amplifiers which would allow deletion of the high power klystron amplifier (HPA). * Relaxation of the frequency conversion subsystem specifications to ap­ proximately those requirements applying to the AN/MSC-46 multiple carrier modification equipment. The antenna reflector system consists of a solid-surface, 18-meter (60-foot) diameter, high-efficiency main reflector and a subreflector. The HT terminal G/T and EIRP capabilities are 39 dB/0K and 127 dBm, respectively, and the terminal has a multiple transmit and receive carrier capability. The AN/MSC-60 terminal Interfaces with a communications subsystem at IF frequencies of 70 or 700 MHz for both transmit and receive carriers. Tuning of transmit and receive carriers in increments of 1 kHz over the full 500-MHz uplink and downlink satellite frequency bands is provided. An automatic carrier balance capability provides automatic leveling of each transmitted carrier with an accuracy of *0.2 dB. The AN/MSC-60 terminal has been designed with extensive and"}
