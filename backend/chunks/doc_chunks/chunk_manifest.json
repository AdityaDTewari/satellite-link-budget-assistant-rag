This is shown in Fig. 3 for an earth station at height ℎ1 with an apparent elevation angle of 90o−β1. From Snell’s law in polar coordinates: 𝑛(ℎ𝐺)(𝑅𝐸+ℎ𝐺)=𝑛(ℎ1) (𝑅𝐸+ℎ1)sinβ1 (20) in which case the grazing height, ℎ𝐺, can be determined by iteratively solving equation (20).

If the height of the space station is greater than 100 km above the surface of the Earth, then 𝑛𝑠 = 1. Since propagation through the atmosphere is reciprocal, the gaseous attenuation for a space -Earth path, where the apparent elevation angle at the space station is φ𝑠, is identical to the gaseous attenuation for the reciprocal Earth -space path, where the apparent elevation angle at the earth station is φ𝑒. As a result, the gaseous attenuation for a descending space -Earth path can be calculated as the gaseous attenuation for the corresponding ascending Earth -space path.

INTRODUCTION Assatelliteandearthrelay communication services continueto expand involume ofusage, increased information bandwidth requirements, andnew applications, aconsistent demand will betoward theuse of higher frequencies where permissible. The inuninent use ofmillimeter wavebands [above 50GHz) has prompted theoretical and experimental studies ofthelimitations imposed bytheatmosphere online-of-sight relay and earth-to-space [both up- anddown-link) propagation paths. The studies have shown thatlimitations arise mainly from signal attenuation (absorption andscattering bythemedium), noise emission (natural), or interference (man-made) produced inpart orwholly bypropagation pheno- mena. Oneoftheprinciple causesofboth attenuation, noise andpoten- tial interference isthatcausedbyrain orhydrometeors. Although the physics ofscatteringbyhydrometeors iswell inhand [Crane, 1971), several different methodologies have developed toattempt totreat this particular phenomenon, having atotallystatistical occurrence behavior asopposed togaseous absorption and emission bytheatmosphere which is continuously present with only astatistical variation about themean. Attenuation causedbyrain aswell asthegaseous contribution increases significantly tomany tensofdecibels atthehigher frequencies deeper into themillimeter wavebands.

When rainy weatherisexperienced alongthelink, thesystem performance will degrade inways which maybereliably estimated. However, due tothe randomness ofthe events occurring inthe troposphere, only statistical predictions canbeconsidered which factor into system designs. Recent modelling based onaglobal climatology ofrain (Crane, 1977a;Crane, 1979b) has provided ameans ofcoupling the rain statistics with the attenuation theory. These results aredescribed here for thepurpose of system design andprediction rather thanelaborating onthetheoryor background covered inthereferences. Several comparisonswith experi- mental results support themodel (Crane, 1979b) andargue for itsadoption forgeneral application tosystem design. 2.2.1 Model Themodel described isused fortheestimationoftheannual atten- uation distribution tobeexpected onaspecific propagation link.

Inaddition todirect diversity measurements, weather radar backscatter experiments are yielding measurements ofrain-cell size and distribution statisticswhich are increasingly valuablein diversity system design andestimation. 2.6.1 Earth TerminalSite-Diversity Atanygiven sitelocation, andperiod ofweatherandhigh rainfall acluster ofrain cells inanarray constituting astorm region, may have aparticularorientation with respect totheweather fronts passing over theregion.

Since the cellscanbeconsideredtoberelatively uniformcolumnsofrain,several kmhigh, acommunication pathmight intercept one ormore ofthesecellsdependingonorientation. Similarly asetofS-band radar datafromOttawa during1970 (Strickland, 1974a) was analyzedstatistically todetermine cellsizedistributions andjoint probabilities ofoccurrence asafunction oftwo path separation dis- tance. These resultsshowed that 80%ofthe cellshad asize Treater than2km, 50%exceededabout 6km, and20% exceeded 14kmextents for an attenuation level criterionof5dB.The attenuations were calculatedfor 15.5 GHzandcomparedwith satellite (ATS-5) measurements. The cell separation statistics were distancesofabout15, 30and45kmforthe threepercentages ofoccurrence exceeded. Recent measurements from Goodland, Kansas (Crane, 1979) have yielded (5dBdown reflectivity) cell diametersofabout 2.5kmwith cellseparations of5to6kmfor all cellsand10to12kmfor significant cell.Storm sizes of30to60km inlength andI0to20kminwidth aretypically observed nominally agree- ingwith the Ottawa observations.

Caution should beexercised before attempting toapply afamilyof curves such asFigure 35oranempirical model extending theconcept to perhaps30GHzassuggested byKaul, etal.(1978). Thedatabase was limited toexperiments inrain climate region D(New Jersey andOhio). Themodel isbased solely onattenuation rather than rain rate statistics. Thediversity paths formingthemodel data base werenominallyofthe same configuration; e.g. NW-SHbaseline orientation, elevation angles of 35°,azimuth angles of220°,andlink frequenciesbelow 20GHz.There- fore,theuseofthemodel isnotrecommended forgeneral application and forpropagation paths departingsignificantly fromtheconditions and notatallforfrequenciesabove 30GHz. Toanalyze therequirements forsite diversityseparation inrain climate region D(P_30GHz)oneshould first proceedwithapath rain attenuation distribution analysis (Section 2.2).Once thesingle-path attenuation versuspercent ofyear exceeded curve isobtained, themini- mumsite (path) separations maybeestimated usingtheISGHzcurves of Figure 35.

Thesesourcesaretobedistinguished from interference {man- made noise), atopic requiring separatetreatment. Thediscussion will belimitedtothenoise producing thesensitivitylimitonsurface-based antennas looking skyward.Theprincipal natural sourcesofnoise emission arethose ofa_mosphericorigin encountered inthemain antennalobe and thelowelevation energy from earthreradiationentering thesidelobes oftheantenna.Specifically, theareasconsidered will belimited to themicrowave emission oftheatmospheric gases,rainemission,and thermal noise contributions duetotheantenna. Theradioskynoise background andscatteredenergy sourcesareomitted orassumed tobe sufficientlysmalltobeneglected. Consequently, strongextraterrestrial noise sources,suchasthesun,will beassumed tobeoutofthemain lobe oftheantenna. Unlike theearth terminal, thesatellite terminal experiences radi- ationfrom theearth andcloud topswithin themainlobe aswell asthe atmospheric emissions. With larger antenna beam widths (smaller aper- tures),thesatellite antennasystem isusually constrained byother sys- temdesign considerations (beyond thescope ofthisreport) than sensi- tivity alone.

This noise canbesignificant since theground provides arelatively high temperature source. The effectoftheintegrated sidelobe contri- bution isareduction inthemain-beamefficiency for antennas that have relatively high sidelobe levels. Shielding toreduce theemission from nearby ground surfaces canimprove the performance. For lowelevation angles (near thehorizon) thenoise contribution from the ground andhorizon temperatures may beparticularly significant with the antenna temperature approaching thatofthesurface (To). Themodel forantenna temperature increase versus decreasing elevation angle depends both onthespecific antenna design (and near side lobe antenna pattern structure) andthe particular terrain features inthe vicinity theantenna faces near thehorizon. These design considerations arealso beyond the scope oftreatment here. 75 CONCLUSION Thisreport covers onlythepropagation pathlossandnoise considerations forearth-to-space communication links operating at frequencies from1to300GHz.

Warner† NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, 44135, USA In an eﬀort to make future communications satellite payload design more eﬃcient and accessible, two tools were created with intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The ﬁrsttool, the Visual Communication Payload design software, allows designers to graphicallydesign their payload by using a simple drag and drop action with payload componentsonto an area within the program. Information about each picked component is pulledfrom a database of common space-qualiﬁed communication components sold by commericalcompanies. Once a design is completed, various reports can be generated , such as theMaster Equipment List. The second tool, RF Link Budget Calculator software, is a link budget calculator designed speciﬁcally for ease of use. Other features of this tool include being able to access a database of NASA ground based apertures for near Earth andDeep Space communication, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) baseapertures, and information about the solar system relevant to link budget calculations. Thelink budget tool allows for over 50 diﬀerent combinations of user inputs, eliminating theneed for multiple spreadsheets and the errors associated with wrong inputs. Both of theaforementioned tools increase the productivity of space communication systems designers,and have the colloquial latitude to allow non-communication experts to design preliminarycommunication payloads.

Introduction Space communications system design can be tedious and complicated when using unoptimized design tools. This is certainly the case with previous link budget calculator tools, which rely on complicatedand contrived spreadsheet operations. In such operations, information is easily lost and/or miscalculatedbecause of the lack of scalability of the spreadsheet formulas. This, in turn, makes communication payload ∗This work was completed over a summer internship at NASA GRC, SCaN, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Student AIAA member. †Senior Physicist, Aerospace Communications Systems Branch, 21000 Brookpark Rd. 1o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics design hard to learn for a newcomer to the ﬁeld. After a link budget is determined for a NASA mission, physical communication payload components must be picked to create and close this link. This step ofthe process involves looking up each company’s product and comparing the product’s characteristics withthe requirements, which takes a lot of time. Creating a more intuitive user interface for calculating thelink budget and picking payload components can reduce any possible error with calculations, obtaining component information, and increase eﬃciency for experienced communications engineers. I.A. Background In the past, other link budget tools have been created to aid the user in calculating a link budget. They have evolved from CLI programs, to formulae across spreadsheets, to primitive GUI programs. For example,an older optical link budget calculator tool created by Emily Kukura previously used command line queriesa ss h o w ni nF i g u r e1 . Figure 1.

For example,an older optical link budget calculator tool created by Emily Kukura previously used command line queriesa ss h o w ni nF i g u r e1 . Figure 1. Command Line Link Budget Program Even more, a satellite communications toolbox has been created by Mathworks to also help calculate basic characteristics for a satellite link. It allows a user to use predeﬁned functional blocks to create graphsfor carrier to noise power. However, using this toolbox involves substantial monetary purchase of MATLABsoftware and time to become acquainted with the MATLAB software and programming language. A link budget is a ﬁrst step for communications payload designers and potential users to determine if a wireless transmitter and receiver can “close” a link, meaning if a wireless signal has enough powerat the receiving end such that its information is retained and readable. 5The link budget is a way for designers and users to obtain a prelimary understanding of the dynamics which will be involved in draftingthe communications systems of a mission. Naively, one could say a link budget equation appears: Received Power =Transmitted Power +Gains+Received Area −Losses (1) Eq. (1) is a simplistic way of showing the idea behind calculating a link budget. Received and Transmitted Power is measured in dBW, while Gains, Received Area, and Losses are measured in dB. This equation becomes far more complex when one considers how to calculate each term. For example, how one determines the gain of DSS 27 based on its inclination, frequency, and surrounding wind froma cursory reading of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook easily demonstrates this. 3So, the diﬃculty/complexity in these calculations is the primary motivation for the creation of a user-friendlyprogram which aides in link budget calculation.

Once the link budget is ﬁnalized, a rough sketch of the generic components needed for the payload is made to obtain an estimate of the power and mass to meet the requirements of the NASA mission. Figure 2shows a generic communication payload for a single fault relay communication system. The switches switchin redundant components if the primary one fails. The diplexers in Figure 2 allows the same antenna totransmit on one frequency band and receive on a diﬀerent one. The use of up and down converters allow acommunication relay to receive and transmit signals between two diﬀerent communication sources. 2o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 2. Schematic of K u-S/K aBand Space-Based Relay Communication Payload After determining the general components needed, the more tedious part of the process begins as the components either need to be custom-made or bought from a commerical company. Space-qualiﬁed compo-nents can be limited in variety as they can be made for speciﬁc missions, while others can be more genericas waveguides and switches. Looking up those components online, calling the companies for more detailedspeciﬁcations, and browsing through physical catalogs takes time. Integrating all the information into oneplace would be more eﬃcient, and a database is perfect for this.

However, once all of these components are picked, the important characteristics of each component are recorded usually into an Excel document to getan estimate of the mass, power, and cost requirements for the mission. These steps are used each time acommunication payload is designed, and going through them takes time. However, if all of the information is saved and easily accessible, the amount of time for this part of the design process can be greatly reduced. II. Design Philosophy The idea behind the two tools was to create interfaces which were user friendly for experts and newcomers tocommunicationpayloaddesign. Togetabetterideaoftheprogram’sappearance, VisualStudiowaschosento aid in creating and designing these tools. Visual Studio is an IDE for Visual Basic which allows the userto design the appearance of the program in situ. With it, common objects such as buttons, radio buttons, textboxes, and combo boxes can easily be moved, resized, and programmed for events. Visual Basic was chosen as the language to program in as it is relatively easy to learn, and versatile when compiled acrossMicrosoft products (as NASA most commonly utilizes). To choose the kind of databases to use for the RF Link Budget Calculator and Visual Communication Payload design tool, the portability of each program had to be considered. Excel spreadsheets were used inthe link budget tool to store the ground antenna information since it was much easier to update and movethe database from any computer. The MySQL database was used for the communication payload designsoftware, because it is open-source and can be installed on any computer. The database of all commercialpayload components contains pictures of each component, leading to a larger sized database, so an Excelspreadsheet database is not the best implementation for this program. Microsoft Access was also a strongconsideration as a database since NASA uses Microsoft products, but the"}, {"id": "nasa-design-analysis-communication-payloads-for-satellites__5", "source": "nasa-design-analysis-communication-payloads-for-satellites.pdf", "chunk_index": 5, "text": "be installed on any computer.

Microsoft Access was also a strongconsideration as a database since NASA uses Microsoft products, but the open-source MySQL was chosensince it could store images. This program could be implemented with an Access database for wider usewithin NASA, but MySQL allows any person to be able to use this program easily. The programs were designed to be modular - so that future developers would be able to remove and/or insert modules and classes as needed. 2This is more practical for the payload design tool because in the future new components will be designed for problems that have not yet been realized. The modularityof the program will allow these components to be easily added. The link budget calculator can also bereprogrammed to allow for greater precision in its various calculations, without rewriting major portions ofits codebase. 3o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics III. Design Implementation Stepping through the process, for the Communication Payload Design Tool, there were several interfaces that needed to be created: main interface, inputting component details, and generating the report form.The main interface is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Main interface of Communication Payload Design Tool The left panel allows the user to create the components onto the white design area on the right. Generic components can be picked on the communication payload design tool and arranged in the certain conﬁgura-tion.

When someone right clicks ontothe component, it gives the user options to delete, edit, or view the component’s information, also shown inFigure 4. The database skeleton was set up and populated with a few example components as shown in Figure 5: 4o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 5. Sample Component for Parabolic Antennas An overview of the features of the Communication Payload Design Tool is located in Appendix A. Likewise, for the Link Budget Calculator Tool, several interfaces were needed: a main interface, a system noise interface, a solar system body distance selection interface, and a antenna database interface. The main interface is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Main interface of link budget calculator The four colored boxes each denote a general domain of discussion for what will be entered/returned. The leftmost is for transmitting information, the next for range information, then for receiving information,and ﬁnally for data information. In each box there are some ﬁelds which are open for input, and some blocked to prevent error (depending upon which options are chosen for a particular calculation).

Prior to running a calculation, each enabled input is checked to be sure it is numeric and in the correct range. To allow the user the option of calculating system noise temperature directly, an interface for calculating the system noise temperature was added as seen in Figure 7. Figure 7. System noise temperature calculator interface 5o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics One can see the various diﬀerent parameters which can be taken into account when calculating system noise temperature. The program allows the user to calculate the system noise temperature three ways: en-tering the system noise temperature directly, entering the receiver noise temperature along with backgroundsand antenna temperatures, or by entering the backgrounds and antenna temperatures above and the lownoise ampliﬁer gain and noise temperature, and the losses after the LNA. The solar system body distance calculator is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Solar system body distance calculator interface This interface allows a user to select either a close, medium, or far approach from a solar body and obtain a range without leaving the program, as the data is preprogrammed in. Finally, the antenna database interface for DSN sites is shown in Figure 9. It allows the user to select the site, the frequency band used, the antenna, the elevation angle, and the cumulative distribution. Figure 9. Antenna database interface The antenna database interface greatly simpliﬁes the process of obtaining data on a particular antenna such as what power, frequency, and gain the antenna is able to transmit/receive.

Results After using the link budget calculator tool to calculate a link, the results of each parameter that goes into calculating the link can be saved as an Excel or pdf ﬁle. A sample of the pdf output is shown in Figure10. Figure 10. A portion of the results given by the link budget calculator’s pdf output The same goes with the Visual Communication Payload Design Tool: Figure 11. Project Description of Design Report The Visual Communication Payload program will generate a report that always consists of the project description cover page as shown in Figure 11. 7o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 12. MEL/PEL Equipment List of Design Report In addition, the second page of the report contains a table of the relevant characteristics for each payload component for a mission, which is often the mass and power equipment list as shown in Figure 12. Figure 13. Component Description of Design Report Then, the rest of the report will contain detailed descriptions of each component such as in Figure 13. Each page is one component, and within each page, a picture is in the top right corner while the relevantcharacteristics are in the top left table. Then the rest of the compoents characteristics are in the main table. V.

Conclusions The creation of these two tools will have shortened the pre-design process for a NASA by performing all the functions needed for a designer as well as making it easy to use for the designer. The link budgetcalculator tool calculates scenarios with diﬀerent parameters such as the link between Earth and weather-observing satellites or transmitting images from rovers on the Jupiter moon, Io, back to Earth. Then thecalculator saves these diﬀerent scenarios in a way so they are easier to compare while integrating relevant 8o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics information into the program. Having all the information in one program allows the link budget analysis to gomoresmoothlyinsteadofhavingtolookuptheradiusofagroundstationantennaordistancebetweentwoplanets. The communication payload tool will shorten the the process of designing the payload by integratingall the information of commercial components in one place, instead of looking up each and every componentthrough separate catalogs. Also, it allows the user to create a visual representation of their design with an intuitive main interface. These two tools are or will be used for NASA missions in communication payload design, and these tools in the future can be expanded on to include more features such as connecting the linkbudget calculator tool together with the communication payload design software to see what componentsare available to meet the requirements of the speciﬁc mission.

INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) User Impact and Network Compatibility Study conducted by Hughes Aircraft Company, Space and Communications Group for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard Space Flight Center, under Contract NAS 5-20357. This study was to identify and examine antennas for the user spacecraft which satisfy TT & C data rates and have minimum impact on the user. The intended scope of the study also originally included considerations of compatibility with the NASA network ground stations and significant effort on antenna configurations which reject or protect from earth generated radio frequency interference (RFI).

The intended scope of the study also originally included considerations of compatibility with the NASA network ground stations and significant effort on antenna configurations which reject or protect from earth generated radio frequency interference (RFI). Upon notification that the frequency bands of operation for the telecommunication links between the TDRS and the users had been changed from VHF/UHF to S-band, this contractor redirected the remaining effort to concentrate on S-band user antennas, specifically those for which reliable hardward implementation data was available. Accordingly, applicable experience from past and current commercial and military space programs has been utilized to arrive at a number of antennas which can be considered suitable candidates for user spacecraft missions. Notwithstanding the elimination of VHF and UHF for the links, the preliminary data gathered on antennas for these bands is nevertheless included in this report at the end of Section 4, User Antenna Study. 1-1 2. SUMMARY 2.1 General TDRSS Concept The TDRSS concept employs two synchronous altitude geostationary satellites deployed in order to provide telecommunication links between multiple earth-orbiting satellites and a centrally located ground station(i). The benefits of employing a data relay satellite system are: (1) Increased user real-time data capability (2) A possible reduction of user satellite on-board data storage (3) A possible reduction of the geographic extent and complexity of the NASA ground tracking and data network. Figure 2.1 shows the general configuration of the overall system. TDRS E is stationed above the Atlantic and TDRS W is above the Pacific Ocean. The communication links from the ground station to the user are defined as forward links, while the links from the user spacecraft to the ground station are defined as return links.

The communication links from the ground station to the user are defined as forward links, while the links from the user spacecraft to the ground station are defined as return links. Although the overall system concept embraces three categories of user, that is, high, medium, and low data rate types, the category exclusively dealt with in this study is the low data rate (LDR) type. For this service both the forward and return links are implemented with broad coverage (26 degree field of view) antennas aboard the TDRS. To put this report into proper perspective, it is of value to discuss the characteristics of two major interacting constituents of the system: the TDRS itself and the user satellites. *Although the nomenclature for this service has been recently changed to the Multi-Access Service (MAS), the term LDR will be used throughout the remainder of this report. 2-1 0 .:: :;:\" U GROUND STATION C USER .. ..

TDRS System Concept 2-2 2.2 User and TDRS Characteristics The LDR links between a TDRS and user spacecraft employ broad coverage TDRS antennas, accommodating user spacecraft with orbital alti- tudes up to 3300 km. Examination of the NASA '78, '79, and '80 Mission Models in Appendix A* shows the majority of users to be orbiting at 300 to 1000 km, which is well within the range of the field of view of the TDRS antennas.

To give some idea of the distribution of the users, Figure 2.2 shows a mission model summary derived from Appendix A, in the form of a density profile. Each dot in the figure represents a different user mission. Also shown is a profile of the user orbital inclinations which shows the distribution tends to bunch at around 300 and polar orbit inclinations. The forward link was defined by the contract Statement of Work(2) to operate at UHF and was subsequently changed(3) to S-band (in the 2025 to 2120 MHz range). The range of forward link bit rates to be con- sidered is 100 to 1024 bits per second. Effective system noise temper- ature of the user at S-band is defined as 1500 K. The return link from the user, originally at VHF and subsequently also changed to S-band (in the 2200 to 2300 MHz range) is to provide a range of bit rates of 1 to 10 kilobits per second. The relevant TDRS characteristics include a 25 dBW equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) at the edge of the field of view; a receiver antenna gain of 28 dB over the field of view; and an effective system noise temperature of 540 K. These figures are consistent with the latest Hughes TDRS baseline(1) A summary of these parameters and characteristics which will be used throughout the remainder of this report is'shown in Table 2.1. *Received from the Study Project Office on 18 July 1972.

It is seen that for the return link performance specified by the Statement of Work for the Study, the data rate requirements of 1 -10 kilobits per second can be satisfied by user antenna gains of between 3 and 13 dB. This condition holds for the 1 watt user RF power originally specified.

This condition holds for the 1 watt user RF power originally specified. It is further seen that, given the capability to generate 5 watts of RF power, the user's antenna gain requirements are significantly reduced in that the same data rate performance can be achieved by much more modest antennas with gains of between -4 and 6 dB. In order to obtain the specified forward link data rates of 100 bps to 1024 bps, Figure 2.3 shows that the user antenna gains should be between 6 and 16 dB. For the lower part of this range of say 100-200 bps, the 6 -9 dB of antenna gain required is shown in Section 4 to be achievable with modest antennas such as spirals of helices. Howeverc, above 200bps. the antenaa gain requirements on the user become more difficult to achieve with simple antennas. Two methods of easing the user's antenna gain requirements on the forward link are an increase in TDRS EIRP and a decrease in the user's receiving system noise temperature. With respect to the latter, the current Hughes baseline for the TDRS itself employs bipolar silicon tran- sistors which provide a system noise temperature of 540 K. A reduction in the user's effective noise temperature to this value from the currently estimated 1500 K produces a decrease in antenna gain of almost 4.5 dB. Thus, it is believed that some combination of increased TDRS EIRP and reduced user noise temperature is needed to permit the use of relatively modest user antennas to achieve the full range of specified forward link rates. 2-7 2.4 Analysis Summary Calculations are performed in Section 3 in which visibility time, expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period, is determined as a function of the beamwidth of the user antenna."}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__10", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 10, "text": "of relatively modest user antennas to achieve the full range of specified forward link rates. 2-7 2.4 Analysis Summary Calculations are performed in Section 3 in which visibility time, expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period, is determined as a function of the beamwidth of the user antenna. Visibility is assumed to exist when a TDRS falls within the user's antenna beam. Cases are examined for the two orbital inclinations (33 and 990) which dominate the mission model and for antennas which are either fixed, partially gimballed, or capable of being fully gimballed. The resulting data, plotted in a series of curves, will aid in preliminary determination of the gimballing and beamwidth constraints for each user depending on the fraction of the orbital period over which communication via the TDRS is desired. Section 4 consists of a comparative examination of candidate antennas for the user spacecraft. The alternatives presented include low gain antennas which are usually fixed rather than.gimballed, and medium gain antennas which require either gimballing or switching between separate antennas for optimum telecommunication visibility with the TDRS's. Presented for consideration also in this section is a series of spacecraft antennas for which actual hardware experience has been accumulated. These include antennas from such early space programs as Surveyor and SYNCOM to the most recent such as the Canadian domestic communications satellite, Anik, and proposed missions such as the HS-507 Pioneer Venus spacecraft. 2-8 3. USER/TDRS COVERAGE AND MUTUAL VISIBILITY STUDY 3.1 Methodology and Ground Rules The purpose of this section is to determine the maximum and minimum periods of mutual visibility between a typical user spacecraft and at least one of two TDRS's.

It is assumed that mutual visibility exists when a TDRS falls within the antenna beam of the user satellite. The TDRS space- craft have been taken to be in geosynchronous orbits. The coverage and visibility analysis in this section is valid regardless of actual TDRS longitudinal position as long as a constant separation between the two TDRS's is maintained. For purposes of this analysis, a separation of 1160 has been assumed. Analysis of the NASA '78, '79, '80 mission models (Appendix A) shows that the TDRSS users have predominately low altitude circular orbits with inclinations of 330 and 990. Beamwidths ranging from 300 to 1000 have been used in the analysis, which is consistent with the frequencies and antenna sizes considered here. Three cases have been investigated: 1) No gimballing of the antenna 2) ± 900 gimballing of the antenna about an axis parallel to the orbit normal direction 3) Gimballing of the antenna through the maximum possible gimbal angle ±a as defined in Figure 3.1. For each case noted the task can be described as follows: For a particular user orbital inclination, altitude and antenna beamwidth, calculate the maximum and minimum communication time between the user and one or both TDRS for a revolution of the user's orbit. The duration of communication is then defined as the sum of all periods of mutual visibility taking place within the span of one orbital period of the user spacecraft. Several revolutions of the user's orbit are examined to determine the true maximum and minimum values of total visibility time. For convenience the results are expressed in terms of a percentage of the orbital period."}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__12", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 12, "text": "mutual visibility taking place within the span of one orbital period of the user spacecraft.

Maximum User Antenna Gimbal Angle o 3-2 3.2 Mathematical Model(4) The approach taken is to determine the radius vector to the user as a function of time in an earth fixed coordinate system and to compare this vector with the constant radius vectors to each TDRS. By comparing these two vectors and rejecting the orbital period times when the earth intervenes between them, mutual visibility as defined above is determined.

For Cases 1 and 2 analysis indicates that communi- cation time is essentially independent of user orbital altitude for 300 km ! h : 1000 km, and thus altitude does not appear as a parameter in the results for these cases. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and minimum visibility times that will be experienced between the user and at least one TDRS for Case 1 (no gimballing). The visibility times are expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period and as a function of user antenna beamwidth.

This means that for this"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__15", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 15, "text": "function of user antenna beamwidth. Figure 3.4a is for a user orbital inclination of 330 00and Figure 3.4b is for i = 99 . As can be seen from the first curve a minimum of zero communication time exists for beamwidths of 650 or less. This means that for this antenna size there will be some revol- utions of the user orbit for which no communication is possible with the TDRSs. A similar condition exists for user orbits inclined at 990 for 300 ! e 1000 (Figure '3.4b). Figure 3.4 also shows that the maximum visibility time for i = 990 is consistently less than that for i = 330 when compared at the same beamwidth. This is to be expected since in the latter orientation the TDRS is never as far out of the user orbit plane as for the polar type orbits, and it is this out-of-plane distance that determines visibility time. Figure 3.5 presents an example of the geographic extent of the visibility regions for each TDRS when viewing a low altitude 330 inclined user orbit. For illustrative purposes, the TDRS's are assumed to be stationed at 190 W and 1350 W longitude. A user antenna beamwidth of 900 is assumed for the case of no antenna gimballing. Communications with a particular TDRS is possible only when the user subsatellite point falls in the TDRS visibility region.

As can be seen from the curve a minimum value of zero exists for user antenna beamwidths less than 570, and increases to 76% at 9 = 1000. Maximum visibility time increases rapidly from 48% for a 300 beam to a constant upper bound of 85% at 0 = 400.

And, as in the case of _900 gimballing, a rapid increase in communication time occurs in the vicinity of 9 = 600, essentially doubling visibility time for the larger beamwidths. 3.4 Conclusions and Recommendations It has been the intent of this section to provide potential users of the TDRSS with sufficient data to allow preliminary determination of the constraints imposed upon the user antenna design as a result of user communication requirements. If a minimum value can be set on communication time, than for a particular orbital geometry, the data presented herein allows the user to determine both the optimum antenna beamwidth and the antenna gimballing scheme. It is recommended that subsequent visibility studies be performed to investigate the impact of: (1) pointing the antenna along the orbit normal direction or along the velocity vector; (2) gimballing the antenna about an axis other than the orbit normal, e.g., the velocity vector, etc.; and (3) allowing two degrees of freedom in antenna gimballing.

An example of the latter is the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO). For these cases, similar visibility studies ean be performed. 3-16 4. USER ANTENNA STUDY 4.1 Introduction The antenna on the user spacecraft is one of the most critical elements in the telecommunications link with the TDRS. An antenna has mass, requires space, usually protrudes from the spacecraft body and often imposes attitude control, gimballing, and deployment constraints, Unlike conventional satellite-to-ground telemetry and command antennas, those on the user are required to exhibit some directivity toward the synchronous altitude TDRS. The higher the achievable gain, the better, since each additional dB of gain in the link is directly translatable to a higher supportable user bit rate. A major factor limiting the telecommunications link performance is terrestrially generated radio frequency interference (RFI). The basic geometry of this RFI problem is shown in Figure 4.1. Each TDRS sees more than 40 percent of the earth's surface, and the LDR return link antenna collects noise power from all emitters in the visible region. The RFI noise level seen by each TDRS will vary slowly, since each TDRS always views the same large region. A low altitude user spacecraft views a considerably smaller portion of the earth's surface, and therefore is affected by a lesser number of RFI emitters, but. is much closer to these emitters, effectively receiving higher power per emitter than the TDRS. A user, orbiting over high"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__21", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 21, "text": "the same large region. A low altitude user spacecraft views a considerably smaller portion of the earth's surface, and therefore is affected by a lesser number of RFI emitters, but. is much closer to these emitters, effectively receiving higher power per emitter than the TDRS. A user, orbiting over high and low RFI emitting regions, experiences a wide range of RFI variations. The most detailed estimate of the RFI that can be experienced by synchronous satellites in the frequency ranges previously allocated to (5)the LDR service has been made by ESL, Inc. in a 1972 study for NASA(5) These estimates were based on an emitter library containing the location, antenna pattern, transmitter power, etc., of about 45,000 RFI sources. 4-1 35,900 km 4-2 In view of the foregoing, a number of requirements must be imposed on the user spacecraft antenna design. To achieve maximum bit rates, the user receiving antenna should attain its maximum gain in the direction of the TDRS and at the same time achieve minimum gain towards the sources of RFI via the antenna side and back lobes. For the return link, the only avail- able method on the user satellite of attempting to overcome the RFI problem is to achieve as high an EIRP in the direction of the TDRS as possible without regard to the side and back lobes. The recent shift in link frequencies from VHF/UHF to S-band (2.25 GHz) eased the requirements on the user in a number of respects. The primary factor is that terrestrially generated RFI no longer appears to be the dominating influence on the user antenna. This fact is evident for two reasons. First, the number of terrestrial transmitters at 2 GHz is far less than the profuse numbers which exist globally at VHF and low UHF.

This fact is evident for two reasons. First, the number of terrestrial transmitters at 2 GHz is far less than the profuse numbers which exist globally at VHF and low UHF. An allo- cation of a small slot of frequency spectrum needed for the LDR service is probably much easier to obtain relatively interference-free at S-band than in the lower bands. Furthermore, whereas the almost 3-to-i frequency difference between the UHF and VHF links precluded the use of a single antenna for both links, that possibility can now be considered at S-band. Also, at S-band the aperture becomes smaller and the radiation pattern interaction between the antenna elements and the spacecraft structure becomes less severe. Despite the fact that VHF and UHF have been deleted, the preliminary data gathered on antennas for these frequency ranges are in- cluded in this section for the purpose of completeness. 4-3 During the study effort, discussion with the GSFC User Impact Study program office(3) led to a request for this contractor to submit data on antennas which have been designed in-house. That is, emphasis is to be on hardware experience with data points extrapolated where necessary to the proper S-band frequency. These antennas, which are identified in Section 4.3, represent viable candidates for the user spacecraft since their weights and functions are more in line with anti- cipated user missions. Primarily because the data collected on S-band antennas has assumed a greater significance, this information is pre- sented in Section 4.3, whereas the data on VHF and UHF antennas (plus scaled information for S-band) is held off until Section 4.4. 4-4 4.2 Technical Considerations Antennas performing over the three distinct bands of VHF, UHF and S-band have"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__23", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "antennas has assumed a greater significance, this information is pre- sented in Section 4.3, whereas the data on VHF and UHF antennas (plus scaled information for S-band) is held off until Section 4.4. 4-4 4.2 Technical Considerations Antennas performing over the three distinct bands of VHF, UHF and S-band have been considered in this study. For these bands the same antenna types are applicable; the only differences being a scaling of size and weight. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are based on data presented in Section 4.4. Not all configurations of the same generic type of antenna are included. For example, only a disc-on-rod antenna is included for endfire type antennas, although there are many others -- helix, pokyrod, yagi, etc. Typical families of antennas representative of different types are summarized in Section 4.4. This collection although not exhaustive serves as a basis of comparison of different generic types by categorizations according to gain, size, weight, etc. 4.2.1 Antenna Environments and Antenna/Spacecraft Interaction The immediate area in the vicinity of the antenna elements is considered the antenna \"environment.\" The detailed constituencies and characteristics of this environment have a profound effect on the shape of the resulting antenna radiation pattern. As frequencies become higher and consequently wavelengths smaller, the interacting effect between the antenna elements and the surrounding environment begins to decrease thus allowing the radiation pattern to become more purely the result of the antenna elements themselves. (6) Thus, the effects of booms, other antennas, protruding equipment, supporting structures, and even the basic spacecraft structure itself present a variety of critical interacting influences. For the most part ascertaining these effects analytically is difficult and experi- mental techniques must be resorted to by the spacecraft designer. 4-5 Table 4.1 Classification of Omnidirectional Antennas $cc 0 0 0 0 * cd 4 V0"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__24", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "the basic spacecraft structure itself present a variety of critical interacting influences.

The higher the gain, the less the interacting effect. Generally speaking, antennas available to the user spacecraft designer can be separated into two distinct categories, that is, medium and low gain designs. The associated design problems and required system trades are in many respects different and can be discussed separately for these two separate classes of antennas. The medium gain antennas, ranging in gains of about 10-15 dB, must usually be mechanically steered in order to keep the beam pointed at the TDRS because they have narrow beamwidths. In these ranges of antenna gain, there is a lower tendency for the pattern to be affected by the spacecraft structure as compared to the lower gain antennas. For the lower gain a:tennas, falling in the range of gains of 2-5 dB, generally the opposite is true. Because of their relatively broad beamwidths, it may not be necessary to steer the elements continuously to keep the beam pointed toward the TDRS. Along with this advantage, however, comes the disadvantage of having lower discriminating protection against unwanted RFI arriving via the antenna radiation pattern side and back lobes. Furthermore, the structural integration of their elements into an overall spacecraft structural design is rendered difficult because of the afore- mentioned effect of basic :pattern interaction with the structure. When a low gain antenna is put on a satellite structure several variables modify the basic antenna radiation pattern (the intrinsic pattern in absence of the satellite body).

The two most signfiicant variables are the antenna size versus the satellite structure size. The curve illustrated in Figure 4.2 shows a typical test result from NRL test analysis(6) of spacecraft interaction effects with satellite structures. In this test, a turnstile antenna was mounted on a spherical spacecraft body. For varying spacecraft to antenna size, various degrees of pattern differences were observed. Generally speaking, as the satellite size is increased more numerous and deeper null appear as part of the 4-9 composite antenna/spacecraft characteristic. Besides spacecraft size, there are other factors affecting the antenna design; among the more important are geometry, element type and its location. Material properties have, at least for the turnstile design, been found to effect changes in performance. Because of the numerous variables involved in the specification of the ultimate radiation characteristics of a low gain antenna, the antenna system integration problem is extremely difficult. Generally speaking before a system engineer can objectivdly select an appropriate design for his mission he is required to understand the impact of all spacecraft structural effects on all antennas from which he is making a selection so that he may choose the design which is more optimum for his application. This type of required data, unfortunately, is not readily available. It couldhowever be determined partially through a systematic investigation. In order to establish which low gain antenna design is most appropriate to a particular spacecraft geometry, it is valuable to conduct either a survey or a numerical and experimental investigation.

A similar, however, for the same cost, more complete evaluation could be conducted analytically. A hybrid approach using methods in unison produces the best results when applied during the actual hardware development stage after which the antenna selection has already been completed. During this stage the numerical analysis could be used to provide initial insight with final design being verified by experiment. 4-10 Of the three methods of studying the spacecraft antenna interaction problem, it is believed the analytical approach is by far the most promising. It gives the capability by which a more complete set of parametric data can be derived; it lends itself more readily to changes, and it is particularly useful to assessing performance effects which are subject to design perturbations. The available numerical techniques for analysis of structural inter- ferences on antenna radiation characteristics can be divided into three different formulation methods. These methods are the most important ones available to date and utilize the following techniques: a) Electromagnetic integral equation formulation b) Wire-grid modeling c) Geometrical diffraction theory Each method has its range of applicability, accuracy and complexity. The geometrical theory of diffraction(7 8, 9) is best suited for the analysis of scattering problems where the interfering structures are large compared to a wavelength. Generally speaking the larger the struc- ture the better the accuracy of the model. The technique is analogous conceptually to that of ray tracing.

The wire-grid modeling technique(10' 11) is based on the premise that a solid conducting body may be substituted by a grid of thin wires con- figured to correspond to the geometry of the scatterer.. Using this grid the unknown currents excited by the incident field may be determined by a system of simultaneous equations. Satisfactory application of this tech- nique requires sufficiently short wire grid segments about 0.1 wavelengths. Once the currents on the grids are established, the corresponding reradiated fields can be calculated and then added to the primary field resulting in the total field of the antenna. 4-11 The technique using the magnetic field integral equation (12,13) is similar to that of the wire mesh. The advantages of this method are that it is theoretically more exact (neglecting mutual coupling), it imposes no restrictions on the materials of the medium, and it provides polarization insight because of its utilization of field vector formu- lation. Although use of this latter technique has shown that individual deviation between the theoretical and experimental pattern of an antenna obstructed by a spacecraft can differ by as much as 5 dB, on the average the agreement is considerably better. One particular advantage of the integral equation formulation is that it is sufficiently general with respect to the primary sources and consequently any source antenna may be used as an input to the analysis. In addition, once the matrix describing the scattering surface has been generated, it can be reused at relatively little additional expense in terms of computer utilization to determine the antenna location for an optimal combined radiation pattern.

Clearly, studies of this form are bpyond the scope of this study. They have been highlighted in order to point out that valuable further studies in this field may be performed to aid the user spacecraft designer in determining the type and location of an antenna for use with the TDRSS. 4-12 4.2.2 Mounting and Deployment Antenna location is generally a compromise between field-of-view requirements and the availability of space and payload mass for the satellite system. Omnidirectional antennas are often the most difficult to locate as their spherical field of view requirement is most difficult to achieve. Omnidirectional antennas are accordingly mounted on booms and masts to achieve a wide angle field of view. Data return from satellites at low bit rates can be achieved with low EIRP. This provides an opportunity to use broadbeam, low gain antennas which do not require steering or tracking. For example, a slotted dipole cone type antenna will provide 2 dB gain over a hemispherical field of view. This antenna could be mounted on a short mast located away from the earth and nearly complete orbital coverage provided with a two satellite relay system. Care would need to be exercised to avoid interference with solar cell arrays or other movable equipments. Satellite telecommunication subsystem designs for higher data rates, which require higher EIRP for reliable transmission may require a balance between antennas, transmitters and power supply in order to minimize overall equipment mass. Minimum mass configurations generally occur at that design point where the mass required for the antenna with its installa- tion is approximately"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__30", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 30, "text": "for higher data rates, which require higher EIRP for reliable transmission may require a balance between antennas, transmitters and power supply in order to minimize overall equipment mass. Minimum mass configurations generally occur at that design point where the mass required for the antenna with its installa- tion is approximately equal to the sum of the mass of the transmitter, its installation and power supply allocation. Thus a switched beam or electrically steered beam may be an appropriate design for the higher data rate users. In this case an unobstructed field of view is required for the installation of any element in a switched beam configuration and a complete unobstructed field of view is required for all elements in an electrically steered beam configuration. Mechanical gimbals may also be employed for high gain antennas where the mass of a phased array antenna would be prohibitive. It is judged that antennas I meter or more in diameter should use mechanical beam steering. Such an antenna would have a peak gain of 25 dB at 2.25 GHz. It may then be concluded that mechanical beam steering would not be appropriate for the low data rate class of user satellites. 4-13 4.2.3 Antenna Polarization Terrestrially-generated RFI is assumed to consist of all polarizations of equal power; that is to say, if one were to measure the power level of the RFI with a linear polarized antenna, or a right-hand circularly polarized antenna, etc., the power level in each case would be the same. Therefore, there is no advantage in designing an antenna with any particular polarization in an attempt to reduce the level of the RFI. However, the receive signal level can be increased by adjusting the polarization of the transmitting antenna to the receive antenna or vice versa. 4.2.4 Low Gain Semi-Omnidirectional"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__31", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 31, "text": "Therefore, there is no advantage in designing an antenna with any particular polarization in an attempt to reduce the level of the RFI. However, the receive signal level can be increased by adjusting the polarization of the transmitting antenna to the receive antenna or vice versa. 4.2.4 Low Gain Semi-Omnidirectional Antennas Antennas on the order of a half wavelength are low gain (2-4 dB) and radiate nearly uniformly over large sectors. They have the advantages of being lightweight, can be easily stowed and deployed, and usually require no gimballing. They have the disadvantages of large interaction with the spacecraft and unwanted gain in the direction of the RFI. These latter effects can be minimized by placing them above a ground plane or inside a cup. Doing so reduces the back radiation with a corresponding decrease in radiated coverage. The degree to which the back radiation can be reduced depends on the size of the ground plane. One-half wavelength diameter ground planes are effective when the desired radiation is perpendicular to the ground plane. However, when maximum radiation is desired parallel to the ground plane, multiple wavelength sizes are required to reduce the radiation past the edge of the ground plane. Chokes placed at the edge of a ground plane effectively make it appear larger. The judicious use of the spacecraft structure can also act as a ground plane to partially shield from RFI sources.

Here the wavelengths are relatively small and consequently insignificant structural difficulties arise. In Table 4.1, these antennas have been classified according to back radiation, weight, interaction with the spacecraft, stowage and deployment requirements and polarization characteristics. 4-14 4.2.5 Multiple Wavelength Antennas Multiple wavelength antennas can consist of continuous apertures or arrays of discrete elements. They are normally medium or high gain and radiate a pencil beam, fan beams or other special beam shapes. Continuous apertures include horns, parabolic and spherical reflectors, corner reflectors and lenses. They have the advantage of small interaction with the spacecraft and low back and sidelobes. They have the disadvantages of greater weight, usually require stowage and deployment and require mechanical steerability at the lower frequencies. Array antennas consists of discrete radiators, either directly or parasitically exited. By varying the phase and amplitude of the fed radiating elements, these arrays can radiate anywhere from normal to the array (broadside) to parallel to it (endfire). Endfire arrays, although physically small in the plane orthogonal to the direction of maximum radiation, suffer from the fact that the gain increases only as t the square root of the length. Array type antenna have the advantage of small interaction with the spacecraft, and electronic steerability in some cases.* For all of the configurations summarized in Section 4.4, the S-band designs pose fewer structural problems which allows for greater flexibility in the electrical design. Table 4.2 categorizes these antennas according to back radiation, weight, interaction with spacecraft, polarization and stowage and development characteristics. *In all array designs the interaction between the spacecraft structure and the overall pattern is to a significant extent dependent upon the gainof the individual array elements themselves. 4-15 4.2.6 Antenna Switching Two or more half wavelength antennas which have reduced coverage and lower"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__33", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 33, "text": "polarization and stowage and development characteristics. *In all array designs the interaction between the spacecraft structure and the overall pattern is to a significant extent dependent upon the gainof the individual array elements themselves. 4-15 4.2.6 Antenna Switching Two or more half wavelength antennas which have reduced coverage and lower back and sidelobes can be placed at different locations on the spacecraft and energized electrically to provide the required coverage. Since continuous aperture antennas require mechanical steering to provide greater coverage, additional antennas could be placed on the spacecraft and switched in and out eliminating the need for steering. Although an array type antenna can be electronically scanned, the gain degrades as a function of the scan angle.(14) It may, therefore, be advantageous to provide more than one array and switch between them depending on the look angle required. As pointed out previously, the tradeoff between using more than one array and providing higher RF transmitter power depends on the point where minimum user spacecraft mass is achieved. Minimum mass configurations have been shown to occur at that point where the mass of the antenna is equal to the sum of the mass of the transmitter and its power supply.(15) 4.2.7 Feed Networks The antennas discussed here may be fed by balanced trans- mission lines or by coax and a balun (balance-to-unbalance trans- former), and in some cases by waveguide. Care must be taken to insure that the feed lines provide satisfactory isolation. Shielded balanced transmission lines offer the best guard against this since any currents induced on the shield or spacecraft excite equal currents on the two lines and are therefore RF grounded. When using coax lines the outer shield and the spacecraft structure itself must present zero resistance to the unwanted induced currents. Waveguide line becomes increasingly attractive"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__34", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 34, "text": "guard against this since any currents induced on the shield or spacecraft excite equal currents on the two lines and are therefore RF grounded. When using coax lines the outer shield and the spacecraft structure itself must present zero resistance to the unwanted induced currents. Waveguide line becomes increasingly attractive from a loss standpoint with increasing fre- quency. However, even at S-band physical bulk and weight disadvantages still generally outweigh the electrical advantages. The recommended practice, therefore, is to use coaxial cable feed lines. 4-16 4.2.8 Antenna Weights The antenna weights given in the Tables 4.1 and 4.2 include both the radiating elements and the feed network and represent construction techniques which make use of modern spacecraft antenna structural and materials technology. Techniques of construction such as electroforming resulting in wall thickness of .013 cm, etching on copper clad polyguide and metal forming has substantially reduced the weight of antennas. Choices of lightweight materials such as honeycomb and metal sprayed plastics have become more available. Radiating surfaces, whether directly or parasitically excited, can be perforated with holes up to a half wavelength at the operating frequency without serious degradation of performance. In addition, surfaces can be formed by half wavelength resonant structures eliminating the need for solid surfaces. Feed networks have been developed in air stripline with reduced weight and power loss. The weights of the Hughes antennas for past space missions reflect the materials and structural technology in existence at the time they were designed. Thus, the weights for similar antennas to those given in Section 4.3 could be considerably lower in most cases if up to date antenna technology were utilized. 4-17 -FIBERGLASS SLEEVE -0.02 WALL FROM TRAVELING- CONDUCTOR WAVE TUBE 0.02D TEFLON 0.472D 0.08---1'- 002 ST \\ T0.662DO 0.40D 0073'0 RECEIVER r-40 0.22 091 4.321-9- 41.4021 02522"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__35", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 35, "text": "similar antennas to those given in Section 4.3 could be considerably lower in most cases if up to date antenna technology were utilized. 4-17 -FIBERGLASS SLEEVE -0.02 WALL FROM TRAVELING- CONDUCTOR WAVE TUBE 0.02D TEFLON 0.472D 0.08---1'- 002 ST \\ T0.662DO 0.40D 0073'0 RECEIVER r-40 0.22 091 4.321-9- 41.4021 02522 0.9 4.46312 -- 4.321 -- 0734 025 D= DIAMETER WALLS: 0.015 IN.

SYNCOM Antenna Configuration 4-18 4.3 S-Band Antenna Studies In order to obtain practical satellite S-band antenna hardware data, this contractor was requested to specifically examine and report on actual satellite antenna designs. This section presents electrical and mechanical performance data for various Hughes satellite antennas, either actual or proposed hardware designs. Where data for the proposed TDRS S-band frequency was not available, the actual designs were extra- polated in terms of mass and dimensions from their operating frequencies. 4.3.1 SYNCOM(16) The SYNCOM antenna required an omnidirectional pattern in a plane perpendicular to the axis of satellite rotation and a directional or flattened \"pancake\" pattern in the plane containing the axis. This was achieved by an array of three collinear skirted dipoles mounted on and extending from the axis of rotation. Figure 4.3 shows the configuration of the SYNCOM antenna. The dipoles are center-fed by annular slots in a coaxial transmission line. A single skirted receiving dipole (for operation at 8 GHz) is shown at the right-hand tip of the antenna structure. The measured antenna radiation patterns provided by the SYNCOM antenna are shown in Figure 4.4 for both azimuth and elevation cuts. It is noted that the SYNCOM antenna operated at 1.8 GHz, however, scaling the dimensions to 2.25 GHz for TDRS has negligible effect on the overall antenna weight, which at 1.8 GHz was 2 kilograms.

The slot radiator is covered with a fiberglass radome. A stripline corporate feed is associated with each quadrant; the outputs of the four corporate feeds connect to a 4-way power divider. The antenna is designed to provide approximately -6 dB gain over a nearly spherical coverage area. The pre- dominant radiation is polarized in the plane of the spacecraft wheel spin axis. Elliptical polarization occurs in the region of the polar axis. A schematic of a portion of the OSO \"bellyband\" antenna is shown in Figure 4. 7. In addition to the probes and S-band cavities shown, two VHF whip antennas are integrated with and protrude from each quadrant of the slot array. The resulting S-band radiation patterns are shown in Figure 4.8. The characteristics and performance of the OSO-I antenna are given in Table 4.5.

These include the USAF Tactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT), (19) the INTELSAT IV, and the Canadian Domestic Satellite, ANIK. Of these, the TACSAT bicone operates at 2 GHz, whereas the commercial satellites operate at 4 GHz for telemetry. The two cones which make up the aperture, shown in Figure 4.9, are usually spun out of sheet aluminum. The circular guide in the center is machined from aluminum stock, the slots are then machined, and the cones are then spot-welded to the circular guide. The bicones are then housed in a fiberglass thermal shield and mounted on top of the spacecraft. A set of radiation patterns for the bicone antenna is shown in Figure 4.10.

The antenna consists of two plane reflectors spaced approximately a half wavelength apart with the feed placed between them. The primary reflector is cupped to form a cavity. The antenna surfaces can be made from either perforated sheet metal or wire mesh with aluminum ribs. Stowage and deployment of this type of antenna will be necessary in most instances.

The axial mode helical radiator is formed by winding a wire in a helix with a pitch angle of from 11 to 16 degrees and a diameter of the order of X/3. A metallic ground plane whose dimensions are of the order of X is placed at one end of the helix. The helix is usually fed by a coaxial line whose outer conductor terminates on the ground plane and whose inner conductor passes through the ground plane to form the helix. The helix itself may be wound on a dielectric tube or supported by dielectric spokes extending from a tube along the longitudinal axis of the helix. 4-35 GROUND PLANE HELICES (PLATED) AND ON THIN FIBERGLASS TUBE Figure 4.14.

In particular, four types which were examined include slotted planar arrays, arrays of helices, paraboloidal reflectors and feeds, and rectangular horns. Table 4.10 pro- vides a summary of the principal characteristics of each of these antennas.(26) The relationships between the dimensions of the antennas and their gains are shown in Figure 4.41 for an operating frequency of 2.25 GHz. In order to proceed to an estimation of the relationship between antenna weight and gain, assumptions were made as to the materials best suited for their fabtication. For example, for an array of helices, lightweight, high-strength materials such as berylli:nm and magnesium, and dielectric materials such as fiberglass and teflon are used. The weights of very large arrays are only rough estimates and specific designs for these antenns in a space environment have not been made. 4-67 2500 1270 HORN LENGTH w 500 i PLANAR z ARRAY O 250 SIDE 127 O PARABOLIC REFLECTOR DIAMETER 50 HELICAL ARRAY LENGTH AND DIAGONAL 25 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 ANTENNA GAIN, DECIBELS 'Figure 4441.

Comparison of Antenna Sizes 4-68 Figure 4.42 shows the results of the weight vs. gain comparison. In addition to the four antennas mentioned above, the data collected for two specific Hughes biconical horns 'are also plotted in the figure. It should be pointed out.that there are several inherent limitations in the practicability of this kind of weight versus gain comparison. The data plotted are only for the antenna elements themselves and exclude such items as diplexers, antenna control electronics, gimbals, supporting structures, rotary joints, etc. This exclusion compensates in part for the fact that on a weight basis, directional antenna systems for spin- stabilized satellites suffer unfairly because of the requirement for despinning in comparison with antennas.for 3-axis stabilized satellites. Alternatively, one could postulate a correction factor to even out this comparison. However, a single correction factor for spinners does not appear to be feasible. It is further noted that in general electronically scanned antennas are desirable where mechanical motion of the antennas cannot be tolerated or the rapidity of the required beam steering exceeds the capabilities of mechanical mechanisms. For the user spacecraft and the TDRSS geometry under consideration, neither of the requirements for mechanical motion or rapidity-of beam steering apply. Thus, based on this consideration alone, only mechanically steered or switched, or fixed antennas should be considered for application by the users. It is for the above mentioned reasons that the weight versus gain comparison given here should be used only-as a rough guide to give insight into the choice of user antenna selection, and not for the selection itself based on minimum weight. 4-69 A Electronically despun array of linearly polarize d ---- ...cavity backed slots"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__51", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 51, "text": "mentioned reasons that the weight versus gain comparison given here should be used only-as a rough guide to give insight into the choice of user antenna selection, and not for the selection itself based on minimum weight. 4-69 A Electronically despun array of linearly polarize d ---- ...cavity backed slots (GMS -- )_ 0 TELESAT -Bicone (scaled in frequency) 0 o TACSAT Bicone a Surveyor Planar Array 20---iJ, 1 I ___ 200 ----- ---H--.. ___' -7. ..- ,-. - i \"- I i i,: ...

The calculations of some parameters will be explained in detail and the sources of each of the assumptions will be clarified. 5.1.1 Free-Space Loss The free-space loss is given by: A (dB) = 32.4 + 20 log f (MHz) + 20 log d (km) Since the link frequencies are nominally 2.2 GHz, and using the maximum distance of 44,000 km from the user"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__52", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 52, "text": "of each of the assumptions will be clarified. 5.1.1 Free-Space Loss The free-space loss is given by: A (dB) = 32.4 + 20 log f (MHz) + 20 log d (km) Since the link frequencies are nominally 2.2 GHz, and using the maximum distance of 44,000 km from the user to the TDRS, the free-space loss is: A = 192 dBo 5.1.2 User Transmitter Power and Antenna Gain The values for user antenna gain and transmitter power will be left variable to be determined by the user mission, the needed data rate being the primary influencing factor. Two values of transmitter power will subsequently be assumed for purposes of illus- trating antenna gain versus data rate: 1 watt and-5 watts delivered to the antenna terminals. Although the Statement of Work for the study specified a user transmitter power of 1 watt, it is not unreasonable to assume that some users can deliver 5 watts of RF power to the antenna terminals. 5-1 5.1.3 TDRS Antenna Gain and User Receiving System Noise Temperature The TDRS S-band antenna gain over field of view of 260 is taken as 28 dB. This value was specified at a meeting with the User Impact Study Project Office. (3)' The meeting also resulted in specifi- cation of the user receiving system noise temperature of 1500 K. 5.1.4 TDRS Receiving System Noise Temperature A value of 540 K receiving system noise temperature for the TDRS has been assumed. This value is believed to be in consonance modern S-band receiver front-end technology using bipolar transistors. The re- sultant receiving noise power density at the TDRS is -201.3 dBw/Hz-K. 5.1.5 Bit Energy to Noise Density Ratio For the forward link, with a probability of bit error of -510-5 and phase shift keying, a theoretical bit energy to noise density"}, {"id": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact__53", "source": "nasa-tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-system-user-impact.pdf", "chunk_index": 53, "text": "S-band receiver front-end technology using bipolar transistors. The re- sultant receiving noise power density at the TDRS is -201.3 dBw/Hz-K. 5.1.5 Bit Energy to Noise Density Ratio For the forward link, with a probability of bit error of -510-5 and phase shift keying, a theoretical bit energy to noise density ratio of 9.6 dB is required. On the return link, convolutional encoding with an optimal decoder using soft decision (K=7, rate ) is assumed. The coding gain thus achievable is 5.5 dB. This results in a required bit energy to noise density ratio of 4.1 dB. (27) 5.1.6 Miscellaneous Losses An overall miscellaneous loss of 3 dB is assumed to account for polarization mismatch, transponder loss, demodulation loss, and pseudo- noise (PN) loss. 5-2 5.1.7 System Margin A margin of 3 dB over the threshold of bit energy to noise density ratio required to give a probability of bit error of l0-5 is considered necessary to assure confidence that the ultimate system performance is at least the specified value or better. 5.1.8 Link Budget Tables Table 5.1 represents a summary of the forward link calculations taking into account the assumptions made above. The resulting forward link rate is given in terms of the user satellite antenna gain. A similar set of calculations is summarized for the return link in Table 5.2 in which the return link rate is given in terms of the available user satellite EIRP. These link budget calculations were performed in the absence of RFI. 5-3 Table 5.1.

From Section 5.1, the forward link rate is given by R = Gu + 14 dB-Hz where Gu is the antenna gain on the user satellite. Thus, Gu = R -14 = 30.1 -14 = 16.1 dB maximum, and = 20 -14 = -6 dB minimum. The bottom half of Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between the forward link rate and user antenna gain. It is seen , for example, that a 500 bps command rate can be achieved with a user antenna gain of 13 dB. For the return link, the Statement of Work requires a minimum telemetry rate of 1 kbps and a maximum of 10 kbps. Again, from Section 5.1, the return link rate is given by R = EIRP + 27 dB-Hz where EIRP is the user equivalent isotropically radiated power. Thus, EIRP = R -27 = 40 -27 = 13 dBW maximum, and = 30 -27 = 3 dBW minimum. For the two different levels of user RF power, I watt and 5 watts, the top half of Figure 5.1 shows the influence of user antenna gain on the return link bit rate. A modest 5 dB user antenna gain is seen to produce either a 1.6 kilobit .or an 8 kilobits per second return link rate, depending on the user's RF power level. 5-7 A number of conclusions can be drawn from the data rate tradeoffs shown in Figure 5.1.

First, the return link appears to be adequately sized to bracket the user data rates specified in the study Statement of Work. Needless to say, the 7 dB difference between the 5 watt and 1 watt user critically affects the type of antenna required aboard the user satellite. The significance of this dB-for-dB coupling between antenna gain and transmitter power can be illustrated by taking a 2.5 kbps return link rate as an example. The curves show that the 5 watt user requires only a 0 dB antenna gain, whereas the I watt user needs 7 dB. Along with the 0 dB antenna gain comes the inherent quality of omni- directionality, whereas the 7 dB gain antenna requires either orientation, or switching between multiple 7 dB gain antennas, or accepting reduced user orbital coverage by the TDRS if only a single fixed 7 dB antenna gain can be afforded. Thus, wherever possible, to avoid the requirement of oriented or steered antennas, the user should provide about 5 watts of RF power into a low gain antenna. Given the parameters previously assumed, the forward link is not as well matched to the required data rates as the return link. For the ranges of bit rates required by the Statement of Work, that is 100 bps to 1024 bps, user antenna gains in the range of 6 to 16 dB are required. In order to reduce these gains to more modest levels, it is recommended that either the user's receiving system noise temperature be reduced or the TDRS transmit power be increased, or some combination of both.

In order to reduce these gains to more modest levels, it is recommended that either the user's receiving system noise temperature be reduced or the TDRS transmit power be increased, or some combination of both. With respect to the former, the current Hughes TDRS baseline makes use of bipolar silicon transistors which provide an overall noise temperature of 540 K, a reduction of 4.5 dB below the assumed 1500 K user noise temperature. It is hoped that such a reduction in noise temperature can also be achieved by the users. 5-8 6. REFERENCES 1.

ITU-R P.618 -14 1 RECOMMENDATION ITU-R P.618 -14* Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of Earth -space telecommunication systems (Question ITU-R 206/3 ) (1986 -1990 -1992 -1994 -1995 -1997 -1999 -2001 -2003 -2007 -2009 -2013 -2015 -2017 -2023) Scope This Recommendation predicts the various propagation parameters needed in planning Earth -space networks/systems operating in either the Earth -to-space or space -to-Earth direction. The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly, considering a) that for the proper planning of Earth -space networks/systems, it is necessary to have appropriate propagation data and prediction techniques; b) that methods have been developed that allow the prediction of the most important propagation parameters needed in planning Earth -space networks/systems, recommends that the methods for predicting the propagation parameters in Annex 1 should be used for planning Earth -space networks/systems in the respective ranges of validity indicated in Annex 1.

Effects of the non -ionized atmosphere need to be considered at all frequencies, but become critical above about 1 GHz and for low elevation angles. These effe cts include: a) absorption in atmospheric gases; absorption, scattering and depolarization by hydrometeors (water and ice droplets in precipitation, clouds,"}, {"id": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E__3", "source": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E.pdf", "chunk_index": 3, "text": "must be considered.

These effe cts include: a) absorption in atmospheric gases; absorption, scattering and depolarization by hydrometeors (water and ice droplets in precipitation, clouds, etc.); and emission noise from absorbing media; all of which are especially important at frequencies above about 10 GHz; b) loss of signal due to beam -divergence of the earth -station antenna, due to the normal refraction in the atmosphere; c) a decrease in effective antenna gain, due to phase decorrelation across the antenna aperture, caused by irregularities in the refractive -index structure; d) relatively slow fading due to beam -bending caused by large -scale changes in refractive index; more rapid fading (scintillation) and variations in angle of arrival, due to small -scale variations in refractive index; e) possible limitations in bandwidth due to multiple scattering or multipath effects, especially in high -capacity digital systems; f) attenuation by the local environment of the ground terminal (buildings, trees, etc.); g) short -term variations of the ratio of attenuations at the up - and down -link frequencies, which may affect the accuracy of adaptive fade countermeasures; h) for non -geostationary satellite (non -GSO) systems, the effect of varying elevation angle to the satellite. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 3 Ionospheric effects (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) may be important, particularly at frequencies below 1 GHz. For convenience these have been quantified for frequencies of 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 3 and 10 GHz in Table 1 for a high value of total electron content (TEC).

The effects include: j) Faraday rotation: a linearly polarized wave propagating through the ionosphere undergoes a progressive rotation of the plane of polarization; k) dispersion, which results in a differential time delay across the bandwidth of the transmitted signal; l) excess time delay; m) ionospheric scintillation: inhomogeneities of electron density in the ionosphere cause refractive focusing or defocusing of radio waves and lead to amplitude fluctuations termed scintillations. Ionospheric scintillation is maximum near the geomagnetic e quator and smallest in the mid -latitude regions. The auroral zones are also regions of large scintillation. Strong scintillation is Rayleigh distributed in amplitude; weaker scintillation is nearly log-normal. These fluctuations decrease with increasing fr equency and depend upon path geometry, location, season, solar activity and local time. Table 2 tabulates fade depth data for VHF and UHF in mid -latitudes, based on data in Recommendation ITU-R P.531. Accompanying the amplitude fluctuation is also a phase fluctuation. The spectral density of the phase fluctuation is proportional to 1/ f 3, where f is the Fourier frequency of the fluctuation. This spectral characteristic is similar to that arising from flicker of frequency in oscillators and can cause significant degradation to the performance of receiver hardware. 4 Rec.

An apparent exception is path depolarization which, although of concern only from the standpoint of interference (e.g. between orthogonally -polarized signal transmissions), is directly related to the propagation impairments of the co -polarized direct signa l. The information is arranged according to the link parameters to be considered in actual system planning, rather than according to the physical phenomena causing the different effects. As far as possible, simple prediction methods covering practical applica tions are provided, along with indications of their range of validity. These relatively simple methods yield satisfactory results in most practical applications, despite the large variability (from year to year and from location to location) of propagation conditions. As far as possible, the prediction methods in this Annex have been tested against measured data from the data banks of Radiocommunication Study Group 3 (see Recommendation ITU-R P.311). 2 Propagation loss The propagation loss on an Earth -space path, relative to the free -space loss, is the sum of different contributions as follows: – attenuation by atmospheric gases; – attenuation by rain, other precipitation and clouds; – focusing and defocusing; – decrease in antenna gain due to wave -front incoherence; – scintillation and multipath effects; – attenuation by sand and dust storms.

At frequencies below 10 GHz, it may normally be neglected. Its impo rtance increases with frequency above 10 GHz, especially for low elevation angles. Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU -R P.676 gives a complete method for calculating gaseous attenuation, while Annex 2 of the same Recommendation gives an approximate method for f requencies up to 350 GHz. At a given frequency the oxygen contribution to atmospheric absorption is relatively constant. However, both water vapour density and its vertical profile are quite variable.

The method to predict the probability of non -zero rain attenuation along a slant path is described in § 2.2.1.2. If reliable long -term statistical attenuation data are available that were measured at an elevation angle and a frequency (or frequencies) different from those for which a prediction is needed, it is often preferable to scale these data to the elevation an gle and frequency in question rather than using the general method. The recommended frequency -scaling method is found in § 2.2.1.3.

Diversity systems able to re -route traffic to alternate earth stations, or with access to a satellite with extr a on-board resources available for temporary allocation, can improve the system reliability considerably. Site diversity systems are classified as balanced if the attenuation thresholds on the two links are equal, and unbalanced if the attenuation threshol ds on the two links are not equal. At frequencies above 20 GHz, path impairments other than rain can also affect site diversity performance. There are two site diversity predictions models: – the prediction method described in § 2.2.4.1 that is applicable to unbalanced and balanced systems and computes the joint probability of exceeding attenuation thresholds; and – the prediction method described in § 2.2.4.2 that is applicable to balanced systems with short distances and computes the diversity gain.

The simplified prediction method described in § 2.2.4.2 may be used for separation distances less than 20 km; however, it is less accurate. 2.2.4.1 Prediction of outage probability due to rain attenuation with site diversity The diversity prediction method assumes a log -normal distribution of rain intensity and rain attenuation.

Median durations are of the order of several minutes. No significant dependence of these distributions on fade depth is evident in most measur ements for fades of less than 20 dB, implying that the larger total time percentage of fades observed at lower fade levels or at higher frequencies is composed of a larger number of individual fades having more or less the same distribution of durations. S ignificant departures from log -normal seem to occur for fade durations of less than about half a minute. Fade durations at a specified fade level tend to increase with decreasing elevation angle. For the planning of integrated services digital network (ISDN) connections via satellite, data are needed on the contribution of attenuation events shorter than 10 s to the total fading time. This information is especially relevant for the attenuation leve l corresponding to the outage threshold, where events longer than 10 s contribute to system unavailable time, while shorter events affect system performance during available time (see Recommendation ITU -R S.579). Existing data indicate that in the majority of cases, the exceedance time during available time is 2% to 10% of the net exceedance time. However, at low elevation angles where the short period signal fluctuations due to tropospheric scintillation become statistically significant, there are some cas es for which the exceedance time during available time is far larger"}, {"id": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E__24", "source": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E.pdf", "chunk_index": 24, "text": "cases, the exceedance time during available time is 2% to 10% of the net exceedance time. However, at low elevation angles where the short period signal fluctuations due to tropospheric scintillation become statistically significant, there are some cas es for which the exceedance time during available time is far larger than in the case at higher elevation Earth -space paths. 2.2.5.2 Rates of change of attenuation (fading rate) There is broad agreement that the distributions of positive and negative fade rates are log -normally distributed and very similar to each other. The dependence of fade rate on fade depth has not been established. 2.2.5.3 Correlation of instantaneous values of attenuation at different frequencies Data on the instantaneous ratio of rain attenuation values at different frequencies are of interest for a variety of adaptive fade techniques. The frequency -scaling ratio has been found to be log -normally distributed, and is influenced by rain type and rai n temperature. Data reveal that the short -term variations in the attenuation ratio can be significant, and are expected to increase with decreasing path elevation angle. 2.3 Clear -air effects Other than atmospheric absorption, clear -air effects in the absence of precipitation are unlikely to produce serious fading in space telecommunication systems operating at frequencies below about 10 GHz and at elevation angles above 10°. At low elevation a ngles (  10°) and at frequencies above about 10 GHz, however, tropospheric scintillations can on occasion cause serious degradations in performance. At very low elevation angles (  4° on inland paths, and  5° on overwater or coastal paths), fading due to multipath propagation effects can be particularly severe. At some locations, ionospheric scintillation may be important at frequencies below about 6 GHz (see Recommendation ITU-R P.531). 2.3.1 Decrease in antenna gain due to"}, {"id": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E__25", "source": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E.pdf", "chunk_index": 25, "text": "angles (  4° on inland paths, and  5° on overwater or coastal paths), fading due to multipath propagation effects can be particularly severe.

Apart from the rapid signal fluctuations discussed in § 2.4, they cause an antenna -to-medium coupling loss that can be described as a decrease of the antenna gain. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 17 This effect increases both with increasing frequency and decreasing elevation angle, and is a function of antenna diameter. Although not explicitly accounted for in the refraction models presented below, this effect is negligible in comparison. 2.3.2 Beam spreading loss The prediction method for Earth -to-space and space -to-Earth beam spreading loss is given in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. 2.4 Scintillation and multipath fading The amplitude of tropospheric scintillations depends on the magnitude and structure of the refractive index variations along the propagation path. Amplitude scintillations increase with frequency and with the path length, and decrease as the antenna beamwi dth decreases due to aperture averaging. Measured data shows the monthly -averaged r.m.s. fluctuations are well -correlated with the wet term of the radio refractivity, Nwet, which depends on the water vapour content of the atmosphere. There are three parts of the method of predicting the fading due to amplitude scintillation: 1) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading at free -space elevation angles  5° (§ 2.4.1). 2) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading for fades  25 dB (§ 2.4.2). 3) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation in"}, {"id": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E__26", "source": "R-REC-P.618-14-202308-I!!PDF-E.pdf", "chunk_index": 26, "text": "three parts of the method of predicting the fading due to amplitude scintillation: 1) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading at free -space elevation angles  5° (§ 2.4.1). 2) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading for fades  25 dB (§ 2.4.2). 3) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation in the transition region between the above two distributions (§ 2.4.3). As noted in Recommendation ITU -R P.834, a radio wave between a station on the surface of the Earth and a space station is bent towards the Earth due to the effect of atmospheric refraction. As a result, the apparent elevation angle, which considers atmosph eric refraction, is greater than the free-space elevation angle, which only considers the line -of-sight between the two stations. If the free-space elevation angle of interest is greater than or equal to 5°, the difference between the apparent and free -space elevation angles is insignificant, and only the prediction method described in § 2.4.1 needs to be considered. An illustrative example of the three parts of the prediction method is shown in Fig. 2. Note that the prediction method in the transition region described in § 2.4.3 is tangent to the distribution described in § 2.4.1 at a free -space elevation angle of 5° and tangent to the distribution described in § 2.4.2 at a scintillation fading depth of 25 dB. 18 Rec.

Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 23 2.5 Estimation of total attenuation due to multiple sources of simultaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation For systems operating at frequencies above about 18 GHz, and especially those operating with low elevation angles and/or margins, the effect of multiple sources of simultaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation must be considered. Total attenuation (dB) represents the combined effect of rain, gas, clouds and scintillation and requires one or more of the following input parameters: AR ( p) : attenuation due to rain for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Ap in equation (8) AC ( p) : attenuation due to clouds for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Recommendation ITU -R P.840 AG ( p) : gaseous attenuation due to water vapour and oxygen for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Recommendation ITU-R P.676 AS ( p) : attenuation due to tropospheric scintillation for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by equation ( 49) where p is the probability the attenuation is exceeded (i.e. the CCDF) in the range from 50% to 0.001%. Gaseous attenuation as a function of percentage of time can be calculated using § 2.2 of Annex 2 of Recommendation ITU -R P.676 if local meteorological data at the required time percentage are available.

Due to the dominance of different effects at different probabilities as well as the inconsistent availability of test data at different probability levels, some variation of r.m.s. error occurs across the distribution of probabilities. 2.6 Attenuation by sand and dust storms Very little is known about the effects of sand and dust storms on radio signals on slant -paths. Available data indicate that at frequencies below 30 GHz, high particle concentrations and/or high moisture contents are required to produce significant propaga tion effects. 3 Noise temperature As attenuation increases, so does emission noise. For earth stations with low -noise front -ends, this increase of noise temperature may have a greater impact on the resulting signal -to-noise ratio than the attenuation itself. 24 Rec.

When the surface temperature Ts (K) is known, the mean radiating temperature, Tmr, may be estimated for clear and cloudy weather as: Tmr = 37.34 + 0.81 × T S K (70) In the absence of local data, an atmospheric mean radiating temperature, Tmr, of 275 K may be used for clear and rainy weather. The noise environments of stations on the surface of the Earth and in space are treated in detail in Recommendation ITU-R P.372. For satellite telecommunication systems using the geostationary orbit, earth stations will find that the Sun and, to a lesser extent, the Moon, are significant noise sources at all frequencies, and the galactic background is a possibly significant consider ation at frequencies below about 2 GHz (see Recommendation ITU -R P.372). In addition, Cygnus A and X, Cassiopeia A, Taurus and the Crab nebula may contribute to the sky background noise temperature. Refer to Recommendation ITU -R P.372 to determine the earth station system noise temperature from the brightness temperatures discussed above. 4 Cross -polarization effects Frequency reuse by means of orthogonal polarizations is often used to increase the capacity of space telecommunication systems.

Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization by the ionosphere is discussed in Recommendation ITU-R P.531. As much as 1° of rotation may be encountered at 10 GHz, and greater rotations at lower frequencies. As seen from the earth station, the planes of po larization rotate in the same direction on the up - and down -links. It is therefore not possible to compensate for Faraday rotation by rotating the feed system of the antenna, if the same antenna is used both for transmitting and receiving. 4.1 Calculation of long -term statistics of hydrometeor -induced cross -polarization To calculate long -term statistics of depolarization from rain attenuation statistics the following parameters are needed: Ap : rain attenuation (dB) exceeded for the required percentage of time, p, for the path in question, commonly called co -polar attenuation (CPA)  : tilt angle of the linearly polarized electric field vector with respect to the horizontal (for circular polarization use  = 45°) f : frequency (GHz)  : path elevation angle (degrees).

Only differential phase effects were apparent, even for severe rain events, and single -parameter compensation (i.e. for differential phase) appears sufficient at 6 and 4 GHz. Measurements at 6 and 4 GHz have also shown that 99% of the XPD variations are slower than  4 dB/s, or equivalently, less than  1.5°/s in the mean path differential phase shift. Therefore, the time constant of a depolarization compensation system at these frequencies need only be about 1 s. 5 Propagation delays Radiometeorologically -based methods for estimating the average propagation delay or range error, and the corresponding variations, for Earth -space paths through the troposphere are available in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. The delay variance is required for satellite ranging and synchronization in digital satellite communication systems. At frequencies above 10 GHz, the ionospheric time delay (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) is generally smaller than that for the troposphere, but may have to be considered in special cases.

ITU-R P.618 -14 27 (see Recommendation ITU -R P.676). This contribution is the largest source of uncertainty, even though the dry atmosphere adds 2.3 m of the zenithal excess range delay. For current satellite telecommunication applications, additional propagation delays contributed by precipitation are sufficiently small to be ignored. 6 Bandwidth limitations In the vicinity of the absorption lines of atmospheric gases, anomalous dispersion produces small changes in the refractive index. However, these refractive index changes are small in the bands allocated to Earth -space communications, and will not restrict the bandwidth of systems. Multiple scattering in rain can limit the bandwidth of incoherent transmission systems due to variation in time delays of the multiple -scattered signals; however, the attenuation itself under such circumstances will present a far more serious problem. A st udy of the problem of bandwidth limitations imposed by the frequency dependence of attenuation and phase shift due to rain on coherent transmission systems showed that such bandwidth limitations are in excess of 3.5 GHz for all situations likely to be enco untered. These are greater than any bandwidth allocated for Earth -space communications below 40 GHz, and the rain attenuation will therefore be far more important than its frequency dependence. 7 Angle of arrival Elevation -angle errors due to refraction are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834.

These are greater than any bandwidth allocated for Earth -space communications below 40 GHz, and the rain attenuation will therefore be far more important than its frequency dependence. 7 Angle of arrival Elevation -angle errors due to refraction are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. The total angular refraction (the increase in apparent elevation) is about 0.65°, 0.35° and 0.25°, for elevation angles of 1°, 3° and 5°, respectively, for a tropical mar itime atmosphere. For a polar continental climate the corresponding values are 0.44°, 0.25° and 0.17°. Other climates will have values between these two extremes. The day -to-day variation in apparent elevation is of the order of 0.1° (r.m.s.) at 1° elevati on, but the variation decreases rapidly with increasing elevation angle. Short -term angle -of-arrival fluctuations are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. Short -term variations, due to changes in the refractivity -height variation, may be of the order of 0.02° (r.m.s.) at 1° elevation, again decreasing rapidly with increasing elevation angle. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the effect of the short -term changes in the refractivity -height distribution and the effect of random irregularities superimposed on that distribution. A statistical analysis of the short -term angle-of-arrival fluctuation at 19.5 GHz and at an elevation angle of 48° suggests that both in elevation and azimuth directions, standard deviations of angle -of-arrival fluctuations are about 0.002° at the cumulative time percentage of 1%. The seasonal varia tion of angle -of-arrival fluctuations suggests that the fluctuations increase in summer and decrease in winter.

For non -GSO systems, where the elevation angle is varying, the link availability for a single satellite can be calculated in the following way: a) calculate the minimum and maximum elevation angles at which the system will be expected to operate; b) divide the operational range of angles into small increments (e.g. 5 degrees wide); c) calculate the percentage of time that the satellite is visible as a function of elevation angle in each increment; 28 Rec.

Theauthors' main contributions have come inbridging between theresults ofothers. Therefore,thecredit forthis Handbook must gotothose cited so liberally asreferences andtotheNASA personnel oftheCommunications and Information Systems Division oftheOffice ofSpace andTerrestrial Applications whohave sponsoredandguided thedevelopment ofthis Handbook. Theauthors herein acknowledge their support technically andfinancially. This secondedition oftheHandbook incorporates numerous corrections andmodifications. Avery thorough critique byE.Smith andW.Flock ofJPL, forwhich wearehighly appreciative, resulted inalarge number ofchanges. Thecomments ofusers ofthehandbook also pointed outseveralneeded changes. Wehave included, primarily inChapters 3,5and6,thesignificant contributions ofpropagation researchers that have been published over the last severalmonths. Chapter 7hasbeen modified toinclude additional guidance inallocating link performance andavailability.

Thesystem designer, wanting togain afamiliary with theresults ofthis work,, andtokeep abreast ofnewdevelopments, soon encounters difficulty in finding theinformation needed. This ispartly because ofthenumber of different journals used toreport onresearch inthepropagation area. Inthe IEEE forexample, four societies (AP, COM,MTT, andAES) claim alegitimate interest insome aspects ofthesubject. Another problem isthelack ofa good tutorial ortextbook covering themany diverse topics involved. NASA, which hassupported alarge part oftheexperimental work in thepropagation area, perceived theneed forahandbook ofsome description that would bring together, under onecover, most ofwhat thesystem designer needs toknow about tropospheric propagation above 10GHz. This volume isthe outcome ofaprogram, sponsored byNASA, toproduce such aHandbook. This Propagation Handbook forsatellite system engineers provides a concise summary ofthemajor propagation effects experienced onearth-space paths inthe10to100GHzfrequency range.

Inthecase ofclear airattenuation, adequate coverage has been given inother publications andsoonly asummary oftheestimation techniques ispresented. Theestimation ofdepolarization duetorain andice hasnotbeen developed tothedegree required forpreparing good design estimates forsatellite systems. Therefore, acomprehensive chapter on depolarization hasbeen included that attempts toconsolidate thework of several investigators inthis area. Inorder tomake theHandbook readily usable tomany engineers it hasbeen arranged intwoparts. Thenext four chapters comprise the descriptive part. They deal insome detail with rain systems, rain and attenuation models, depolarization andexperimental data. This descriptive part oftheHandbook isintended toprovide background forsystem engineers whowantmore detail than that presented inthelater design chapters. Chapters VIandVIImake upthedesign part oftheHandbook andmay beused almost independently oftheearlier chapters. InChapter VI,the design techniques recommended forpredicting propagation effects in earth-space co_unications systems arepresented. Some selection hasbeen made from alternative models inorder that only onedesign technique be utilized. This selection wasmade based ontheability ofthetechnique to model theexperimental results. Thechapter includes step-by-step procedures forusing theprediction models andnumerous examples. Chapter Vlladdresses thequestions ofwhere inthesystem design process theeffects ofpropagation should beconsidered, andwhat precautions should betaken when applying thepropagation results. Theunadvised useof propagation results inthelinkmargin canresult inoverdesign. This chapter bridges thegapbetween thepropagation research data andtheclassical link budget analysis ofearth-space communications system. This chapter presents a generalized design procedure, andillustrates itsusethrough extensive examples.

Thecombined effect ofthe characteristics onboth scales leads tothecumulative distribution of attenuation anddepolarization versus time, theduration offades and depolarization periods, andthespecific attenuation/depolarization versus frequency. Inthis chapter, wediscuss howthecharacteristics aredescribed andmeasured, andhowthemicroscopic andmacroscopic aspects are statistically related toeach other. Wealso describe howonemajor propagation effect, specific attenuation, canbeestimated. This informationp will serve asbackground fortherain andattenuation models ofthenext chapter. ° Precedingpageblank 2.2 2.2.1TYPESANDSPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONSOFRAIN Stratiform Rain Inthemidlatituderegions, stratiformrainfall isthetype ofrain which typically showsstratified horizontal extents ofhundreds ofkilometers, durations exceeding onehour andrainrates less•than about 25mm/h (1inch/h). This rain type usually occurs during thespringandfallmonths andresults, because ofthecooler temperatures, invertical heights of4to6km. For communications applications, these stratiformrains represent arain rate which occursforasufficiently long period that thelinkmargin maybe required toexceed theattenuation associated with aone-inch perhour rain rate. Asshownbelow, this ismuch easier todoatfrequencies below the22 GHzwater absorption line, than forfrequencies above theH20line. 2.2.2 Convective Rain Convective rains arise because ofvertical atmospheric motions resulting invertical transport andmixing. Theconvective flow occursina cell whose horizontal extent isusuallyseveralkilometers. Thecell usually extends toheights greater than theaverage freezing layer atagiven location because oftheconvective upwelling.Thecell maybeisolated orembedded in athunderstorm region associated with apassing weather front. Because ofthe motion ofthefront andtheslidingmotion ofthecell along thefront, the high rain rate durationisusuallyonlyseveralminutes, These rains arethe most common sourceofhigh rain rates intheU.S. andCanada. 2.2.3 C_clonicStorm Tropicalcyclonicstorms(hurricanes)sometimepassovertheeastern seaboard during theAugust-October time period.These circular storms are typically 50to200kmindiameter, move at]0-20kilometers perhour, extend tomelting layer heights upto8I_andhave high (greater than 25ram/h) rain rates..!.•L _i,___ ... _. i.-.¸•.¸ _ :U..\"- •.\" ,L-•. i-_-_ 2.2.4 Long-TermDistributions Thestratiform andcyclonic rain types cover large geographic locations andsothespatial distribution oftotal rainfall from oneofthese storms isexpected tobeuniform.

Clearly the total rainfall andrain rate varies significantly over thescale of10kmfor this region. Theeffect isattributed tothepresence ofthelarge water mass andtheheat-islandassociated with Tampa. Over more uniform terrain, Huff andShipp (1969) have observed precipitation correlation coefficients of0.95 over 5mile extents for thunderstorms andrainshowers inIllinois. Thecorrelation wasalso higher along thepathofstormmotion compared toperpendicular tothepath, aswould beexpected. Note that this correlation iscomputed fortheperiodofthe storm andisnottheinstantaneous spatial correlation coefficient required to estimate theeffectiveness ofground stationsitediversity. 2.2.5 Short-Term Horizontal Distributions Radars operatingatnonattenuating frequencies have been utilizedto study both thehorizontal andvertical spatial components ofconvective rain systems. Atypical horizontal distribution (actually observedat1.4degrees elevation angle) isshowninFigure2.2-1 forathunder showerinNewEngland (Crane andBlood -1979). Here rain rate variations of100:1 areobserved over ranges of10kmforashowercontaining four intense cells. Similar measurements have beenmade byGoldhirsh (1976), atWallops Island, VA.

These experimental results clearly demonstrate that therain rateisuniform upto4kmaltitude andthen decreasesdramatically ataltitudes inthe6to8kmrange. Thisdecrease is also associated with theO°Cisotherm height. Note howthemedian isotherm height increases with theupdraft, convective, high rain rate cells. This effect will beused later inaGlobal Rain PredictionModel along with the seasonaldependence ofthemedian isotherm height. Abovethis isotherm, thehydrometeorsexist intheform ofice crystals andsnow. These forms ofhydrometeors donotcontribute significantly totheattenuation, butthey cangive rise todepolarization effects. 2.3 SPECIFICRAIN ATTENUATION 2.3.1 Scatterin 9 Rain drops both absorb andscattermicrowave energy along an earth-space path. Fromthebasic Rayleigh scatteringcriteria (thedimensions ofthescattereraremuch smallerthan thewavelength) andthefact that the median rain drop diameter isapproximately 1.5mm,onewould expect that Rayleigh scattering theory shouldbeapplied inthefrequency (wavelength) range from IOGHz (3cm) to100GHz(3mm).

Thethree most commonly used distributions are qLaws andParsons (LP) Marshal l-Palmer (MP) Joss-thunderstorm (J-T) anddrizzle (J-D) Ingeneral theLaws andParsons distribution (Laws andParsons - 1943) isfavored fordesign purpo'ses because ithasbeen widely tested by comparison tomeasurements forboth widespread (lower rain rates) and convective rain (higher rain rates). Inthehigher rain rate regime (>_25mm/hr) andatfrequencies above lOGhz, theLPvalues give higher specific rain attenuations (Olsen, etal-1978) than theJ-Tvalues (Joss, et al-1968). Ithasbeen observed that theraindrop temperature ismost accurately modeled bytheO°Cdata rather than 2O°C, since formost high0 elevation angle earth-space links theraindrops arecooler athigh altitudes andwarm asthey fall toearth. Anexample ofthemeasured number distributionofraindrops with drop diameter asafunction ofrain rate R(mmlh) isgiven inFigure 2.3-1.

However, thelarger drops tend todominate thespecific attenuation atthehigher rain rates ofmost concern forthesystem engineer, andsothis deviation tends nottobe reflected intheintegral over drop diameters utilized inspecific attenuation calculations. Joss, etal(1968) have found significant variations ofNDandA fordifferent types ofrainfall based ononeyear's measurements atLocarno, Switzerland. These results arepresented inTable 2.3-1; however, the. climatic regions where theJoss statistics apply havenotbeen determined. Therefore, itappears best toutilize theLaws andParsons results, realizing that incertain areas oftheU.S. andCanada they have notbeen verified.

These include: (1)optical systems requiring imaging orscattering light from raindrops, (2)replicating techniques where apermanent record ofeach drop size ismade such asthe flour method (Laws andParsons -1943), dyed filter paper (Marshall and Palmer -1948), sugar coated nylon orfoil impactors, (3)capacitive •techniques duetochanging dielectric constant, and(4)impact types of sensors (Rowland -1976). Todaytheimpact-type ofsensor(calledadisdrometerafter drop distribution meter), isthefavored technique. TheApplied Physics Laboratory hasdeveloped twostyles ofdisdrometer with decided advantages overthe commercially available Distromet Ltdunit. These three types have been described byRowland (1976) andtheir calibration hasbeen compared.

Ithasbeenempirically observed(Ryde andRyde -1945, Kerr -1951) that thespecific attenuation _(dBlkm) isrelated totherain rate R(mmlh) byarelation =a(f)R b(f) 14 v b 41where thecoefficientsaandbarefunctions offrequency. Atthis time the most thorough calculations of_have been made byOlsen, etal(1978). These calculations extend from ltolO00 GHzandhave been presented inboth tabular andgraphical format forseveralraindrop distributions andtemperatures. For theU.S. andCanada theO°Cnumbers aremost applicable (Rogers -1978). Table 2.3-2 (Olsen, etal1978) isgiven below forselected frequencies of interest. TheLPLandLPHrefer toLaws andParsons drop sizedistribu- tions associated with rain rates Rfrom 1.27 to50.8 m/h and25.4 to152.4 mm/h, respectively. Olsen, etal(1978) havealso providedanalytic approximations fora(f) andb(f) which arequiteadequate forusebysystem engineers. These are a(f) =4.21 x10\"5(f) 2\"42 =4.0g xI0\"2(f) 0\"6992.9sfs 54GHz 54sfs180 GHz and b(f)-1.41 (f)-0.0779 =2,63 (f)-0.2728.5-<f<25GHz 25<f-<164 GHz where fisinGHz. Thus for20GHz =a(f)R b(f) dB/km =4.21 x10-5(20) 2.42R1\"41(20)-0\"0779 dB/km =0.059R1\"117=2.19dB/km@R=25.4mm/hr. ThevalueinTable2.3-2 forthis frequency is0.0626 R1\"119 =2.34 dB/km @R=25.4mm/hr, anerror of6%. Based ontheresults ofOlsen, etal(1978), thespecific attenuation relations given inTable 2.3-3 arerecommended inthe10to100GHzfrequency range. Unless noted otherwise, these specific attenuations will beutilized throughout this handbook. 15 _• !-.-: Table 2.3-2 _;:* i '..

Obviously, because rain falls asraindrops, the rain rate iscomputed bymeasuring therain accumulation pergiven area fora known period oftime atapoint.Theshortestperiodoftime reported bythe U.S. andCanadian Weather Services isfive minutes. Assuming therain rate is uniform forthat period oftime, thecomputed point rain rate andthe \"instantaneous\" pointrain rate areequal. However, thequestionarises asto howtheapparent rain rate varies astheintegration (computing) time is varied. This effect hasbeen addressed experimentally byexperimenters atthe Bell Telephone Laboratories. AtHolmdel, NO,measurements (Bodtmann andRuthroff-1974) ofthe apparent rain rate versus thegauge integration period overa2-yearperiod have yielded theresults inFigure 2.5-i. These results extend from 1.5 seconds to2minutes andarenormalized toaone-minuteintegration time. Unfortunately, themeasurement donotextend toa5-minuteintegration time which would bevery convenient forcomparison oftheLinmodel with other rain models which employ aone-minuteintegration period (seeChapter 3).The variation between a2-minute anda5-minuteintegration time isexpected tobe significant forhigh rain rates."}, {"id": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design__29", "source": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design.pdf", "chunk_index": 29, "text": "integration period overa2-yearperiod have yielded theresults inFigure 2.5-i.

However,Figure2..5-1 clearly showsthat for rain rates below 50mm/h theerror duetotheintegration time issmall.This effect arises because thelowrain rate events tend tobespatiallyand temporally uniform,while therain rates between 50and120mm/h aredominated byspatially andtemporally nonuniformconvective rains. Onlythemost severe cells createrain rates above 120mm/h andthese arehighly variable.

TheDutton-Dougherty andGlobal models provide theattenuation statistics given thegeographic andlink parameters. That is,they give the rain rate statistics within themodel.r TheLinandPiecewise Uniform Rain Rate models require aknown setof rain rate statistics togenerate theattenuation statistics. These models relate aspecific ground point rain rate tothesimultaneous attenuation along thepath. 3.1.2 Concepts ofRainfall Statistics 3.1.2.1Cumulative Statistics. Thecumulative statistics foreither rain rate orattenuation areusually presented astheprobability ofexceedance (abscissa) versus therain rate orattenuation (ordinate). They represent stable statisticsaveraged over aperiod sufficiently long that variations in thelowest frequency component ofthetime distribution areaveraged. For rain rate andrain attenuation theperiod corresponding tothelowest frequency isgenerally consideredto beoneyear. Higher frequency components aretheseasonal anddaily variation oftherain rate. Forexample, inthe eastern US,thehigher frequency co_onents arise because more rain falls in thesummer than inthewinter, andmore rain falls between noon and6PMthan between 6AMandnoon local time. Some people have suggested that thell-year solar cycle isthelowest frequency component, butthis hasnotbeen observed bytheWeather Service. 43 Based ontheabove considerations thecumulativestatisticsfor several years arerequired before \"stable\" annual statistics areobtained. Forthis reason, experimentally generated data bases forboth rain and attenuation arenotgenerally good until 5orlOyears ofdata areincluded. However,because ofthelimited lifetimeofthebeacon satellites,attenuation data ataknown frequency andelevation angle isgenerally notavailable for this length ofperiod (Kaul etal-lg77). Therefore datafrom several satelliteslaunched over along period arerequired. -Since they arenotat thesame frequency andelevation angle, these results must bescaledinorder tobecombined.

Thisleads totheexceedance curves forrain rate. Theattenuation isthen derived from therelations between rain rate andattenuation. 3.1.2.2 OutagePeriod Statistics. System designers arealso interested in theaverage length oftime agiven threshold ofrain rate orattenuation is achieved (also termed theoutagetime). Inaddition, thedistribution ofthe outagetime about theaverage isdesired.Theoretical work ofLin(1973) has shown that thedistribution isapproximately lognormal..4 Besidestheoutagetime, Hyde (IgTg) hasidentified thedesire to know theaverage time between outage periodswithin agiven rain event, and theaverage time between outagesbetween tworain events. Thefirst case recognizes that outages above agiven threshold ofattenuation mayoccur several times during thesamegeneralrain event because therain rate is highly time dependent during anevent. Forexample, thepassage ofseveral rain cells associated with agiven rainfront will cause outages aseach cell dominatesthepath attenuation. Itisdesirable toknow theapproximate periodbetween these outagesandthedistributionofthese outage periodsasa function ofthreshold value andtype ofrain event. This type ofdata is expected tobedependent onthegeorgraphic region because theweather fronts 44 Z aredistorted bythepresence ofmountain ranges, lakes, cities, etc. Therefore, extrapolation toother regions isdifficult unless their weather systems aresimilar. Thesecond case (average time between outages intworain events) correlates theperiod between severe storms inagiven region. This period is expected tobeseasonally dependent because inmost regions thehighrain rate storms usually occur during ashort period oftheyear. Again, some statistical estimate oftheaverage period andthedistribution oftheperiods would bedesirable. Generally, outage period data isnotasreadily available asthe cumulative attenuation statistics data. Therefore, thedesigner must rely on thelimited data bases available from CCIR (1978, Rpt564-I), Comsat (Rogers andHyde-1979) orLin(1973).

Intemperate climates only convective storms associated with strong updrafts, highradar tops, hail aloft andusually with thunder canproduce thehigh rainfall rates 45 identified byMode 1.0nly thehighest rates from excessive precipitation data areused todetermine parameters forMode l,which isintended to represent aphysical mechanism aswell asaparticular mathematical form. 3.2.2 Sources ofData Therainfall statistics intheRHmodel arebased uponthefollowing: l) 2) 3) 4) s)Average year cumulative distributionsofhourly rates forthelO years 1951 to1960andforatotal of63stations, with 49in thecontinental U.S. assummarizedintheWeather Service Climatological Data forthis period; Distributions for15-year averages with recording intervals of 6,12,and24hfor22ofthese stations (Jorgenson, etal-lg69); Accumulations ofshort-duration excessive precipitation for1951 to1960forrecording intervals of5,10,15,20,30,45,60, 80,lO0, 120, and180minfor48U.S. stations; AU.S.mapofthehighest 5-min rates expected inatwo-year period (Skerganec andSamson-1970); Maximum monthly rainfall accumulations andtheaverage annual number ofthunderstorm daysfortheperiod 1931 to1960 for17 U.S. stationsand135additional stations reported bytheWorld Meteorological Organization. 3.2.3 RHModel Parameters Theaverage annual total rainfall depth Misthesumofcontributions MIandM2from thetwomodes: M-M1+M2mm andtheratio of\"thunderstorm rain\" MItototal rain Misdefined as =MI/M 46 QThenumber ofhours ofrainy t-min periods forwhich asurface point rainfall rate Risexceeded isthesumofcontributions from thetwomodes: Tt(R)=T1tqlt(R) +T2tq2t(R) hours There are8766 hoursperyear, soTt(R)/87.66 isthepercentage ofan average year during which t-min average rainfall rates exceed Rmm/h.

Extendingtherainmodel toinclude attenuation onearth-space paths, Dutton (1977) hasassumed theMarshall andPalmer(1948) raindrop distribution. Hehasalso included somedegree ofmodeling ofrainfall inthe horizontal direction.This isachieved bymeans ofwhat istermed the \"probability modification factor\" onearth-space links. Theprobability modification factor, F,isgiven by (f/15)2 F_A(-T_T,e) (0.2748+ 0.987) thefactor cannot exceed unity, however. GHz,'(3.3-17) In(3.3-17),fisthefrequency in 8istheelevation angle tothesatelliteindegrees,andA(f,e) isthe 55 path attenuation indB.Theform wasderived from rain storm cell size data given inaparticularly useful form byRogers (1972). TheRogers data, however, were alltaken inthevicinity ofMontreal, Canada. Itwould be desirable tohavemore globally diverse data inorder toderive amore general probability modification factor. Theprobability modification factor, applied strictly toattenuation, multiplies thepercent oftime, Po,during anaverage year that apoint rainfall rate isexpected atagiven location. Themultiplied value represents thepercent oftime, P,(PsPo),that attenuation corresponding toRoisexpected along thepath toasatellite. Thus, ineffect, a point-to-path rain rate conversion, accounting forhorizontal inhomogeneity is developed: IntheDDmodel thesurface rainfall rate istranslated into liquid water content perunit volume, Lo,accumulating attheground. Theliquid water content atSome height, h,above theground, L(h), canbemodeled asa function ofLo(Dutton -1971). Themodeling ofL(h) isdifferent forthe stratiform andconvective rain systems. Inthestratiform modeling L(h) is assumed constant totherain-cloud base, then decreases tozero atthestorm topheight H.Intheconvective modeling L(h) increases slightly tothe rain-cloud base andthen decreases tozero atH. Attenuation perunitlength, _(f,h), duetorain canbecalculated from L(h) viaexpressions oftheform o(f,h)=a(f)[L(h)] b(f) (3.3-18) using thedata ofCrane (1966). Hence, thedistinction between theRayleigh region (f<10GHz, approximately) andtheMieregion (f>lOGHz) isimplicit in(4.3-25), because thecoefficients a(f) andb(f) arefrequency dependent.

Aninterpolation scheme onCrane's data obtains a(f) andb(f)foranyfrequency inthelOto95GHz region. 56 Varianceofattenuation ofearth-spacelinks is,asyet, notdirectly assessable bytheoretical formulation. Thus,itisnecessary toinput, say, twoadditional rain rate distributions corresponding tothelower andupper confidence limits ofRoinorder toevaluatecorresponding confidence limits onanattenuation distribution. This,ofcourse, ass_nes novariance inthe manyparameters surroundingtheattenuation formulation. Thisisclearly not so,andindicates that theprocedure forevaluatingattenuation confidence limits isstillinneed ofrefinement. 3.3.3 Dutton-Dou_hert_ Computer Model Dutton hasdeveloped anupdated computer program (Steele-1979 and Janes, etal-1978)topredict thedistribution ofmeanannual attenuation.

Bothofthese forms utilize cumulative rain rate data todevelop cumulative attenuation statistics. Thefirst form, called theGlobalPredictionModel (CCIR-1978a, Doc. P/lOS-E, 6June), employs apathaveraging parameter \"r\"torelate the point rain rate totheaverage rain rate along thepathfrom theground station tothepoint where thehydrometeors exist intheform ofice crystals. Thelater form ofthemodel (Crane andBlood -1979,Crane -1980a, Ig8Ob) includes path averaging implicitly, andadjusts theisotherm heights forvarious percentages oftime toaccount forthetypes ofrain structures which dominate thecumulative statisticsfortherespective percentages of time.

Figures 3.4-I and3.4-2 show thegeographic rain climate regions forthecontinental andocean areas oftheearth. TheUnited States andEuropean portions arefurther expanded inFigures 3.4-3 and3.4-4 respectively. Theclimate regions depictedbytheGlobal Model arevery broad. The upper andlower rain rate bounds provided bythenearest adjacent region have aratio of3.5atO.Ol percent oftheyear fortheproposed CCIR climate region D,forexample, producing anattendant ratio ofupper-to-lower bound attenuation values of4.3dBat12GHz.

Inthecase ofterrestrial paths, the calculation oftheexpected rain attenuation distribution from along term (20 years) distribution of5-minute point rain rates hasbeen accomplished using empirical formulas deduced from available rain rate andrain attenuation data measured onnine IIGHzradio paths (5-43 km)atfive different U.S. locations ' (Lin-1977).

L,representing alinear relationship between 6andL.However, actual rainfalls arenotuniform over theentire radio path, andtherefore theincrease of6(R,L) with Lis nonlinear. Twofactors intheempirical method accountfortheradio path averaging effect. First, themethod isbased uponthelong term distribution of5-minute pointrain rates inwhich theS-minute time averagingpartially accounts forthefact that theradio pathperformsaspatialaveraging of non-uniform rain rates (Freeny andGabbe-1969, DrufucaandZawadzki-1973, Bussey-lg50). A5-minute average oftherain rate seenatapoint corresponds tospatially averaging approximately 2.1kmofvertically variable rain rates, assuming 7meters/second average descent velocity ofrain drops. Figure3.5-2showshowthepoint rain rate distribution, from two years ofmeasurements atPalmetto, Georgia, dependsontheaverage time intervals (range: 0.5-60 minutes). Theprobability ofa5-minute rain rate exceeding the40mm/h threshold isI/2that ofaO.5-minute rain rate exceeding thesame threshold. Fromanother viewpoint, increasing the averaging time interval from 0.5to5minutes reduces theO.Ol percentile (i.e., 53minutes/year) rain rate from 87to58mm/h. 83 N z 0 z W 0 W n- U-s.- u s-o\" la_ oo *r- _r- 00 ! r_ c_ 84 However,since most radio paths ofinterest arelonger than 2.ikm, thefixed 5-minute average interval cannot adequately account forallthepath length variations. This deficiency iscompensated forbythefactor [I+(3.5-4) Inother words, theauxiliary nonlinear factor represents theempirical ratio between the5-minute point rain rate Randtheradio path average rain rate Rav(L) atthesame probability level. Since thesignificant difference between the5-minute point rain rate andtheO.5-minute point rain rate in Figure 3.5-2 already accounts forthemajor portion ofthedifference between theradio path average rain rate Rav(L )andtheO.5-minute point rain rate, theauxiliary factor isaweak nonlinear function ofL.Obviously, many different analytic functions canbeused toapproximate thismildly nonlinear behavior.Thesingleparameter function isselected foritssimplicity.

Theradar measurements ofrainfall reflectivity atWallops Island, Virginia indicate that ontheaverage rainy day(CCIR-lg77) H:4km (3.5-6) 85 Thus, given theelevation angle 6,theground elevation Hgandthe distribution of5-minute point rain rates, wecancalculate therain attenuation distribution ontheearth-satellite path through theuseof equations 3.5-l, 2and5. Notice that equation3.5-5implies that thepath rain attenuation B (R,L) varies exactly asthecosecant oftheelevation angle ewith this simple extension oftheterrestrial model. Also note that these simpleformulas are valid onlyonthelongterm average. Theshort term relationships between the surface point rain rate andtheearth-satellite path rain attenuation, ona storm-by-stOrm basis, have been observed tobeerratic anddifficultto predict. 3.6 PIECEWISE UNIFORM RAIN RATE MODEL Aquasi-physical model ofreal rains hasbeen developed atthe Virginia Polytechnic Institute andState University (Persinger, etal-1980) to eliminate theneed foreffective path lengths. Themodel accounts forthe nonuniform spatial rain rate distributionandpermits direct evaluation ofthe effective path length integral, A=f_dl, foranarbitrary propagation path. The.piecewise uniform rain rate model isbased onthefollowing two simplifying assumptions: a)thespatialrain rate distributionisuniform for lowrain rates, andb)aspeak rain rate increases, therain rate distribution R(1)becomes increasingly nonuniform. Themodel utilizes aneffective rain extent wherein therain isof height H(above aflat earth) andofbasal length B(inaplane containing the line-of-sightpath andthelocal vertical attheearth terminal location). Therain height values follow from theO°Cisotherm heights (CCIR-1978a, Doc. F5/003).

Forexample, inFigure3.7-2each curve wasdeveloped from equal probability attenuation -rain rate measurements fortheperiod indicated. Twotrends are apparent. First,themonthly curves show adecreasingpath length with increasing rain rate, andsecond,theannual curves showapath length which increases slightly with rain rate. Thefirst effect arises because thehigh rain rate events inAugust areprimarily convective stormswith intense localized rain rates. Thesecond effect isprobably accounted forbecause the winter rains inMaryland aremore uniform innature andthezero degree isotherm issignificantly lower inwinter. Forthis case Leapproaches L forcold weather lowrain rate events. However, this effect hasnotalways been observed(see below) andprobably indicates that regions with low rainfall during thecoldweather months will show arain rate dependence to Lesimilartothat fortheworst month. 93 A E -r k- zw _J -r o. ,,i ow u.

First consider theLe factor ineach model separately. 0! :i3.7.4.1 Dutton-Dougherty Model. Inthis model theeffective path length is incorporated intheliquid water content factor L(h). Forstratiform modeling L(h) isassumed constant totherain-cloud base, then decreases tozero atH, thestorm topheight. Forconvective modeling L(h) increases slightly tothe rain-cloud base, then decreases tozero atH.This isavery complex relation between rain rate andeffective path length.

Assuming aground station at sealevel, 40degrees North latitude andobserving at45degrees elevation angle, theLefactors areplotted inFigure3.7-3 forthetwoforms ofthe Global model, theLinmodel andtheexperimental results ofIppolito (]g?8) andCTSresults (Ippolito-lg7g). Thelatter experimental results (labeled Le,exp(ll.7GHz) inFigure3.7-3) were scaledfrom the29degree elevation angle measurements made atGreenbelt, MDtoCTS, to45degrees using theratio ofthecosecants ofthetwoangles. Theoriginaldata istheannual curve for 1977 and1978shown inFigure3.7-2. This data isthelongest setof continuous, single-site effective path length data published to.date forCTS andtherefore more weight should begiven this curve. Themost important result inFigure 3.7-3 isthat theuseofan effective path length between 4and5kilometers isreasonable. Asignificant variation occurs below 30mm/h which mayarise duetothepresence ofwinter rains, butthis remains unproven. Fortunately formost designproblems the most accurate estimates ofeffective path length arerequired forannual percentages intherange from O.Ol andO.OOl percent ofayear, andinthis range both theexperimental andmodel-generated effective path lengths are approximately 4to5km. However.,assuming a_+Ikmerror bound onLethe error inestimating Leisabout +IdB. IfLeisdirectly related tothe total attenuation, atleast a+IdBerror bound must beplaced ontheestimate ofthepath attenuation.

Ithasbeen shown(Watson andArbabi-1973) that XPIandXPDarethe same ifthehydrometeors responsible forthedepolarization have certain symmetry properties. Thegeometric models that have been used forraindrops andicecrystals have thenecessary symmetry, soXPI=XPDintheory. In practice, ithasbeen found that there isnotasignificantdifference between XPIandXPD. Another term used todescribe depolarization, cross polarization ratio (CPR), isthereciprocal ofXPD. Other parameters inuse, e.g., crosstalk discrimination, crosspolarization distortion, depolarization ratio, crosspolarization level, usually reduce toXPDorXPI. Inthediscussion that follows, itisoften important todistinguish between polarization properties ofawave inspace, andtheparameters thatwe actually measure attheoutput ofthereceiver.

When this performance isclose toideal, and/or theXPDofthewave islow(i.e. severe depolarization), then I=XPD. This will bediscussed in.more detail later. 4.1.2 Hydrometeor Sources ofDepolarization Themajor sourcesofdepolarization onEarth-space paths are hydrometeors, ionospheric Faraday rotation, andmultipath. Thepredominant source atmillimeter wave frequencies ishydrometeors, andrain isthe hydrometeor species that hasthegreatest effect. 106 i 4.l.2.1 Rain.

After passing through therain, thehorizontal component hassuffered agreater decreased inamplitude, sothepolarization direction hasbeen shifted toward thevertical. Inaddition, thedifferential phase shift between thecomponents hascaused thewave tobecome slightly elliptically polarized. These depolarizing effects ofrain aredescribed more rigorously later. 4.1.2.2IceCrystals. Most ofthedepolarizingeffect ofrain isproduced by differentialattenuation. Therefore rain depolarization andattenuation are fairly well correlated. Starting in1975, when ATS-6 propagation experiments were well underway inEurope, researchers were surprised toseeoccasions of severedepolarization that were completely uncorrelated with rain attenuation. Thecause ofthis \"anomalous\" depolarization hassincebeen I07 identified asorientedicecrystals. Icecanoccur ataltitudes above the freezing level incirrus clouds andatthetops ofcumulonimbus clouds. When something causes theicecrystal symmetry axes toalign themselves, itbrings onapolarization-selective phase effect. Wearenowfairly certain that the electrostatic fields associated with electrically-active storms areatleast onea]igning force. This isconsistent with theobserved abrupt changes in XPDcoincident with lightningflashes. Icedepolarization hasbeentheoretically modelled inamanner analogous torain depolarization. Forthat purpose, theicecrystals are assumed tobeeither oblate orprolateellipsoids, corresponding respectively to\"plates\" and\"needles,\" which aretwodistinct typesof crystals that are known toexist inclouds.

Thedifferential phase shift along thepropagationpath wasfound tovary between 0.160 and1.170 perkmat16.5 GHz,values comparable tothat ofmoderate rainfall. Unlike rain, however, snowproduces very little differentialattenuation. The differential phase shift insnowshouldproduce measureable depolarization on Earth-space paths, butlittle ornodirect experimental evidence ofthis has been reported. Graupel, orsnowpellets,mayalso exhibit someanisotropy, and resulting depolarization. Hail particles, which have arough spherical s3A_metry, probably would notcause depolarization.

The scattering effect ofasingle raindrop isdetermined asafunction ofsome parameter(like size), then thedistribution ofthat parameter overthe population ofraindrops isusedincalculating thetransmission coefficients.

The general method should also beapplicable tosatellite paths. Experimental depolarization data onsatellite pathsappears tobe approximately normally distributed. Combining this with theobserved log-normal distribution ofrain attenuatioo, aprobabilistic model of depolarization incombination with attenuation hasbeen proposed (Wallace - 1981).Inthis model thejoint probability density ofXPD, indecibels, and thelogarithm ofrain attenuation, indecibels, isapproximated byabivariate Gaussian density. This description agrees fairly well with experimental results.

BTLCOMSTAR Depolarization Experiment Results (Arnold, et.al. -1979) 144 Estimating theperformance ofcrosstalk cancellation systems isone motivation forinvestigating crosspolarized signal phase. Another reason is that thesignal phase issensitive tocertain properties oftherainmedium (e.g. canting angle), anditsmeasurement canaidinmodelling thepropagation properties ofrain phenomena. Overstreet andBostian (1978) atVPIandSUderived atheoretical description ofthephase between thecopolarized andcrosspolarized signals when rain depolarization ispresent. They assumed identically oriented raindrops, canted atanangle 0with respect toacopolarized reference direction, having known differential attenuation andphase andaknown effective path length. Using Chu's differential attenuation andphase values forthefrequencies andelevation angles oftheCTSandCOMSTAR D-2beacons, they predicted thephase asafunction of0andrain rate, then found phase versus theXPDvalue forthesame rain rate. Thepath lengths usedwere derived from attenuation •statistics forthose beacons attheVPIandSU station. Forlinearly polarized signals atIIand28GHz, itwasfound that thephase wasafairly weak function ofXPDand0,typically remaining with a 450sector forXPDvalues downto15dBover theexpected range of0.For circular polarization, itwasfound that thephase difference Acisgiven by Ac:+_28+At(O=45°) (4.3-30) where A_isthephase difference forLPwaves, andthesign ofthefirst term depends onwhether RHCP orLHCP iscopolarized.

Thephase difference oftheLPsignal normally remained ina20-300 range during arain depolarization event, whereas theCPsignal phase difference varied widely during thecourse ofa rain event. Thephase versus XPDchanges generally followed acharacteristic sequence during convective storms. This indicated thechanges inthenature ofthedepolarizing medium, primarily inpredominant canting angle ofthe raindrops present, through thepassage ofthestorm cell. 145 Theexperimental evidence suggests that crosstalk cancellation schemes would bemore effective using LPthan CPwaves. Thephase ofthe crosspolarized signal, which must beestimated bythecancellation system, is much less variable with linear polarization. Infact, setting thephase of thecancellation signal toaconstant value would give adegree of effectiveness, while eliminating theneed foracomplex phase shifter control system. 4.3.6 Rate ofChange ofDepolarization Tomore fully characterize depolarization, some quantitative description oftherate ofchange oftheamplitude andphase ofthe crosspolarized signal would bedesirable. This information would assist usin designing adaptive controls forcrosstalk cancellation systems, andmayalso provide further insight intothenature ofthemeteorological process responsible fordepolarization. However, there hasapparently been little research effort expended tothis end. Further experimental work, orfurther analysis ofexisting data bases, isneeded inthis area. 4.3.7 Rain Depolarization Dependence onElevation Angle andFrequency Knowledge ofthedependence ofcrosspolarization discrimination on elevation angle andfrequency isquite valuable because itallows ustoextend theusefulness oftime-consuming andcostly measurements.

Icecrystal depolarization isdifferentfrom rain depolarization inthat itis notaccompanied byappreciable copolarized attenuation. This isbecause the depolarization iscaused primarily bydifferentialphase shifts,rather than differential attenuation, which isresponsible forrain depolarization. Another distinguishing characteristic isthat theamplitude andphase ofthe crosspolarized signal often undergo abrupt, coincident changes with large excursions. 147 FREQUENCY - DEPENDENT COMPONENT OF XPD: -20logcRd dB ELEVATION ANGLE- DEPENDENT COMPONENT OF XPD- -20log(geos2_ dB40/ I I I III /30_ NRATE / mm/hr 50 10- 70- 0 i ItIII 10 20 30 40 FREQUENCY --GHz I I I 1 I I +10- 0- RAINRATE-10-70mm/hr 50 30 10 -20- 1 IIIIIII 010203040506070 ELEVATION ANGLE(e)--DEGREES.:,.- .\". z •.,,, Figure 4.3-6.

Cirrus clouds, andthe\"anvil\" that forms atthetop ofmature thunderstorms areallice,andtheupper parts ofcumulonimbus clouds arepredominately ice. Thecrystals that arepresent have oneoftwo shapes determined bythetemperature atthetime offormation. Very cold temperatures, below about -25°C, favor theformation ofneedle-shaped crystals. Flat,plate-like crystals form inamoderately cold environment (-90 to-25°C). Thedimensions ofthecrystals vary between about O.land lmm.! \" Icecrystals form ondust particle nucleiintheatmosphere. The relative abundance ofdustparticles has.been hypothesized asthereason for differences observedinicedepolarization atdifferent locations. In maritime regions, theaircontains relatively fewdust particles compared with continental areas. Asaresult ofthis, maritime airtends tohave fewer, but larger iceparticles than continental airunder similar conditions. Itis believed that thepresence oflarger crystals accounts forthegenerally higher values ofXPDobserved inmaritime versus inland locations (i.e., BTL versus VPI&SU). Like raindrops, icecrystals arenon-symmetrical andthey have a dielectric constant much different from air. These aretwoofthenecessary conditions fordepolarization. Athird condition, apreferred particle alignment, isalso required. Oblate raindrops arealigned byaerodynamic forces, andtheir preferred alignment direction isaffected bytheprevailing winds. Aerodynamics also have arole inaligning iceparticles, butitis believed electrostatic forces also play alarge part. This belief is supported bymany observations during thunderstorms ofrapid XPDchanges coinciding with lightning flashes. This coincidence maybeexplained bythe 150 ..,\"/ e following: Electric fields present inregions between oppositely-charged clouds exert torques onthehighly non-symmetrical icecrystals. When the field issufficiently strong, these torques become significant incomparison with theturbulent aerodynamic forces, resulting inanaverage alignment of the\"needle\" crystal axes andthe\"plate\" crystal planes along thedirection of thefield lines.

Inthis chapter, wedescribe thevarious satellitesusedinthiswork, andpresent summary results ofthe significant experiments conducted intheUnited States. Theresults presented areprimarilycumulative attenuation statistics, though some depolarization measurements areincluded aswell. This is,bynecessity, alimited sampling oftheexisting databases. Wetherefore preface thedatabyciting additional summariesofpropagation datafortheinterested reader. 5.1 SUMMARIES OFEXPERIMENTAL DATA TheInternational Radio ConsultativeCommittee (CCIR) publishes a summaryofworldwide experimental data intheRecommendations andReports issuing from itsperiodicplenary assemblies. Volume Vofthis publication, \"Propagation inNon-lonized Media,\" deals with allaspects ofmicrowave propagation--both terrestrial andearth-to-space. Within Volume V,thedata ispresented asaseriesofreports andrecommendations submitted toand adopted bytheCCIR. Because ofthis presentation format, data ofinterest to designers maybefound inseveralplaces. Themost complete presentation of data isfound inReport 564-1, \"Propagation Data Required forSpace Telecommunication Systems\" (CCIR-1978a). 155 Another handbook being prepared under NASA contract, \"Handbook for the'Estimation ofMicrowave Propagation Effects,\" (Crane andBlood-1979), has additional experimental data andpresents models ofthepropagation phenomena.

Finally, anearlier document prepared forNASA in1977 contains extensive experimental results obtained byNASA-sponsored experimenters. This document, entitled \"ACompendium ofMillimeter Wave Propagation Studies Performed byNASA\" (Kaul, etai-1977), contains areasonably complete summary andreferences tothe15.3 and31.65 GHz(ATS-5) andthe13.2, 17.8, 20and30 GHz(ATS-6) data. Because ofthis document, only asummary oftheATS-5 and ATS-6 resul.ts isrepeated herein. This summary should beused, along with the Compendium, forpre-1977 data. Emphasis will beplaced onpresenting data from theCTSandCOMSTAR satellite systems. 5.2 SATELLITES USEDFOR PROPAGATION RESEARCH Within theUnited States andCanada, four satellite systems (seven satellites) have been utilized toobtain thebulk oftheearth-space propagation data. Abrief summary ofthesatellite characteristics that relate topropagation studies isgiven inTable 5.2-1. TheCOMSTAR system is comprised offour satellites. Themillimeter-wave beacon aboard theD4 satellite isoperating atthis writing inmid-1981. TheCTSsatellite ceased operation forpropagation researchers late in1979..... o !'. ! i\" L\" European researchers used20and30GHztransmissions from theATS-6 during the1975/76 period when thesatellite wasstationed over Europe. The Italian satellite SIRIO, carrying acircularly polarized three-carrier beacon at11.331, 11.597 and11.836 GHz, began operation inOctober 1977. Finally, theOrbiting Test Satellite (OTS), launched bytheEuropean Space Agency, provided beacon transmissions at11.575 and11.786 GHzstarting inMay1978. TheJapanese have launched four satellites supporting propagation research. These aredesignated ETS-II, CS,BSandECS, andcarrybeacons atvarious frequencies near12,20and34GHz(Hayashi, etai-1979). 156 L.- eTableS.Z-I Satellite parameters RelatedtoPropagation Studies Satel1tte i ATS-5 ATS-6 CTS _TAR (satel11_s D1,D2,D3 and04)LaunchDate i 8112169 5130174 1117/76 ETS-II 8177 SIRIO 8/77 CS 12/77 BS OTSDI:5/13176 DZ:7122176 03:6129178 04:2121181 4178 5178Satellite Posltton Initially over IndianOcean, driftedto106°W. longltude;remained spinning at76rpm 94°W.longitode forfirst yearthen moveto35°E.long. andreturned to 140°W. 116\"W.

Radars, radiometers (fixed andsunsynchronous) and low-orbiting satellites canalso provide valuable data, butusually with some deficiency. Ageneral deficiency isthelack ofpolarization data available from these measurement techniques. Specifically, theexpense ofcalibrating andoperating radar systems andtheattenuation saturation effect in radiometer systems limit their use. 5.3 FORMAT OFDATA PRESENTEDi.

Itisinteresting tonote,however,that allfive locations are located insimilar temperate continental rain climate regions. Tworainfall region models areavailable inCCIR publications, that ofRice andHolmberg (1973) describedinCCIR Rep563-I(1978a), andthe Global Precipitation Model •ofCrane(lgSO), presented inCCIR Document P/IOS-E (1978b). Both place the five locations discussed here inthesameclimate zones. Thus, attenuation prediction models based onthetwoabove referenced procedures would yield similar attenuation distributions forallfive locations. Such asimilarity isnotevident forthemeasured annual distributionspresented here forthose five locations. Figure 5.4-7presentsdistributionsatthree locationswhere long-term measurements, extending from 29to36monthsduration, were available. Thelong-term distributions aremuch smoother than theindividual 12month distributions, andthecurves forHolmdel andGreenbeltarevery similar, particularly intheregion from .01to.0025g, which isthearea of great interest forsystemdesign margin criteria.

Therelationships between the.measured attenuations depart from afrequency squared relation particularly athigh attenuation. Astraight line, A2=2.1A1fits thedata closely uptoAI=20dB,butthedata depart from this line atstill higher attenuation. This less than frequency squared attenuation dependence is consistent with thefrequency dependence ofChu's theoretical attenuation coefficients (1974) inthis frequency range. Thefurther decrease infrequency dependence athigher attenuations isconsistent with thesame effect observed in thetheoretical coefficients athigher rain rate since higher attenuation is associated with more intense rain.i InFigure5.4-14, theincrease inthespread between 10%and90%points asattenuation increases isconsistent with constant fractional fluctuation inthe ratio oftheattenuations atthetwofrequencies. 5.5 TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OFFADES Systems maybeable toaccommodate fades during certain months orperiods ofthedaymore readil_ than during other periods. Tohelp assess themagnitude ofthese effects along theeastern U.S. coast, Goldhirsh (1979, 1980) andothers (Rogers andHyde -1979, Brussard -1977) have prepared histograms andcumulative distributions forvarious months andtimes. 180 5.5.1Monthly Distribution ofAttenuation Figure 5.5-1 shows thepercentage oftime foreach month inthe period April 1977 toMarch 1978 that fades of5,15,and25dBwere exceeded. These measurements (Goldhirsh -1979) were made at28.56 GHzfrom theCOMSTAR D2satellite toWallops Island, VAatanelevation angle of41.6 degrees. The fades aremore excessive during thesummer months, except forJuly. This low value forJuly isnotexpected tobeTepresentative forthat month and demonstrates howdatafrom asingle year canmisrepresent thelong-term average value.

The fades aremore excessive during thesummer months, except forJuly. This low value forJuly isnotexpected tobeTepresentative forthat month and demonstrates howdatafrom asingle year canmisrepresent thelong-term average value. Weather Bureau data mayalso beutilized toobtain this distribution bymonth, butthis procedure maybeinaccurate because thetype ofrain may vary significantlythroughout theyear. Some consideration totheamount of rainfall occurringinthunderstorms inagiven month isneededtomake these estimates more realistic. Ideally therain rate distribution foreach month would berequired alongwith theattention models presented inChapter 3.The variability ofthestatistics from year toyear isdemonstrated bya comparison ofthe1977-78 datawith that obtained atWallops Island inthe September 1978-August 1979 period, using theCOMSTAR D3satellite (Goldhirsh - 1980). While theoverall attenuation exceedance plots forthetwoperiods agreed closely, severalmonthly exceedance values differed greatly between years. Thepercentage ofJuly forwhich 15dBwasexceeded, forexample, was about 0.3% inthe78-79 period co_ared with 0.02_ inthe77-78 period. The 15dBexceedance percentages differedbymore than afactor oftwobetween years forsixofthetwelve months. 5.5.2 Diurnal Distribution ofAttenuation Onewould expect severefades tobemost likely tooccurduringthe lateafternoon andearly morning hours, when tropospheric heat exchange isthe greatest andconvective rains aremost frequent. The28GHzCOMSTAR data taken atWallops Island, shown inFigures 5.5-2 and5.5-3 (Goldhirsh -1979), tends toconfirm theexpectation forthelate afternoon.

The11.4GHzdiurnal fade distribution given byBrussard (1977) foranumber ofEuropean locations exhibits amarked peak between 1500 and1800 local time, butnopeak inthe morning. The19.5 GHz1979-80 data forKashima, Japanshowsavery different pattern (Fukuchi, etal-1981), including adropindeep fades ataround 1700 local time. One-year data compiled atPalmetto,Georgia using theCOMSTAR 19 GHzbeacon, shows abroad minimum inthediurnal distributionofdeep fades between about 0500 and1000, andabroad peakbetween 1700 and2300 (Lin, et al-1980). Thediurnaldistribution, like themonthly distribution, varies widely from year toyear. Goldhirsh (1980) presents acomparison ofdiurnal distributions ofthe1977-78 andthe1978-79 periods for2BGHzattenuation at Wallops Isiand. Inthree ofthesixtime intervals, the15dBexceedance percentage differed bymore than afactor oftwobetween theyears. 5.6 FADEDURATION Several experimenters have derivedfadeduration statisticsfor earth-space links. Rogers andHyde (1979) present histograms ofthenun_er of fades exceeding specificdepthandduration for11.6 GHzatEtam andLenox, West Virginia, based onayear's radiometer measurements. Figure5.6-1 shows theLenox histogram. Rogers (1981) gives similardataforShimotsui, Japan, andinaddition shows joint fade durationhistograms forpairsofdiversity sites inWest Virginia andJapan.

Theuseofasun-tracking radiometer toestimate long-term path attenuation provides agreater range ofmeasurement than astationary sky-noise radiometer, butthedata bynecessity includes nonight-time fading events. Also, duetothedependence ofrain attenuation onelevation angle, a rainstorm occurring when thesunislowintheskywould produce deeper fades than anidentical storm occurring closer tonoon.Thus, long-term attenuation datafrom asun-tracking radiometer iscolored bythetime ofdaythat events producing fades tend tooccur.

This suggeststhat thedata bepresented ina semilogarithmic format wherein each parameter isalready alogarithm of another parameter.

Thenearvertical polarization appears tohave slightly more cross-polarization discrimination than thehorizontal polarization. However, both polarizations showless discrimination than theCCIR estimate. Therefore, inthis case, theCCIR approximation appears tobeoptimistic. 188 ...:.............. ............................... :.... •............... ................................ _...........

Afull statistical descriptionofthe availability ofsuch asystem must consider theattenuation anddepolarization jointly. Figure 5.7-4 (Arnold, etal-lg79) depictssuchjoint statistics forattenuation anddepolarization onthe28GHzCOMSTAR-Crawford Hill Link. Thefigure gives thepercentage oftime that agiven attenuation value was exceeded oragiven XPDvalue wasnotexceeded. Note thal_ thelower bound of allthecurves issimply theattenuation exceedance curve, sinceit corresponds tolowvalues ofXPD, which happen avery lowpercentage ofthe time. Thus thelocation ofthis lower bound isestablished byattenuation alone. Ontheotherhand, thecurves become independent ofattenuation for large values ofattenuation, since thenon-exceedance percentage forXPDfar outweighs theexceedance percentage forattenuation. Afamily ofcurves ofthetype showninFigure5.7-4 gives theoutage percentage forahypothetical system that isunavailable when either an attenuation oranXPDthreshold ispassed. This isausefulapproximation, although most systems allow forsome tradeoff between XPDandattenuation. When attenuation islow,forexample, greater crosstalk maybetolerable than when attenuation isappreciable. 5.8 PHASEANDAMPLITUDE DISPERSION Experimental measurements ofthephase andamplitude dispersionin!.' :L\"_ ;_:.i\". !J. :..... i !,Jj:j i\" i: .! .-r .?::.._,\" :,:i:.!..

Thetopics covered are: Gaseous Attenuation Rain Attenuation Cloud, Fog,Sand andDustAttenuation Path Diversity SignaiFluctuations andLowAngle Fading Depolarization Effects Bandwidth Coherence SkyNoise Thetechniques describedherehavebeendevelopedfrom recent ongoing NASA supported studiesandfrom therelevant published literature. These techniques represent thestateofknowledge oftheadverse effects ofthe earth's atmosphere onreliable earth-space transmissions above10GHz. Thischapter provides propagation datainaformat suitableforuse byearth-space linksystemdesignersoperatinginthefrequency range from 10 195 .............. L.. to100GHzintheUnited States andCanada. Inthis frequency range the troposphere canhave asignificant effect onthecarrier-to-noise ratio ofa propagating wave. Typically, thetroposphere attenuates anddepolarizes the carrier signal andadds broadband amplitude andphase noisetothesignal. Theresulting carrier-to-noise ratio reduction reduces theallowable data rate foragiven biterror rate (digital systems) andthequality oftransmission (analog systems). Inthemost severe cases themedium will significantly attenuate thecarrier anddestroythetransmission capabilities ofthelink (termed alinkoutage). Thefrequency ofo_currence andaverage outage time peryear areusually ofmost interest tosystem designers.Propagation studies todate nowallow thepredictions tobemade with ahigh degreeof certainty andhave developedmeans toreduce thefrequency andlength ofthese outages. 6.1.2 Organization ofThis ChapterF T \"' 3 F.- I.

Whatever effects doexist (scintillation, absorption, variation intheangle ofarrival, delay, anddepolarization) arise duetotheinteraction oftheradio wave with the free electrons, electron density irregularities andtheearth's magnetic field. Thedensity ofelectrons intheionosphere varies asafunction of geomagnetic latitude, diurnal cycle, yearly cycle, andsolarcycle (among others).Fortunately,most U.S. ground station-satellite paths pass through themidlatitude electron densityregion, which isthemost homogeneous region. This yields only asmall effect onpropagation. Canadian stations maybeaffected bytheauroral region electron densities which arenormally more irregular. Amore complete discussion oftheeffects isincluded inCCIR Volume VI(1978a). Amean verticalone-wayattenuation fortheionosphere at15GHzfor thedaytimeistypically 0.0002 dB(Millman-1958), theamplitude scintillations aregenerally notobservable (Crane-1977) andthetransit time delayincrease overthefree spacepropagationtime delay isoftheorderof1 nanosecond(Klobuchar-lg73).

Above 20GHzgaseous absorption canhave asignificant effect ona communication systemdesign depending onthespecific frequency ofoperation. Because ofthelarge frequency dependence ofthegaseous absorption, an earth-space communication system designer.should avoid thehigh absorption frequency bands. Alternatively, designersofsecureshort-haul terrestrial systems canutilize these high attenuation frequency bands toprovide system• isolation. 6.2.1 Sources ofAttenuation Inthefrequency range from 10to100GHzthewater vapor absorption band centered at22'235 GHzandtheoxygen absorption lines extending from 53.5 to65.2GHzaretheonlysignificant contributors togaseous attenuation. Thenext higher frequency absorption bands occurat118.8 GHz duetooxygen and183GHzduetowater vapor. Theabsorption lines are frequency broadened bycollisions atnormalatmospheric pressures(low elevations) andsharpened athigh altitudes.

Needless tosay, applicable millimeter-wave attenuation measurements spanning many years seldom exist. Itistherefore necessarytoestimate statistics, using whatever information isavailable. 210 Anestimate oftherainattenuation cumulative statistics maybe determined inseveralways.Theoptimumwaydependsontheamountofrain and/orattenuation dataavailable, andonthelevelofsophistication desired. However, itisrecommended thatthesimplest calculations becarried outfirsttoprovideanapproximation forthestatistics andalsotoactasa checkontheresultsofmoresophisticated calculations. Theflow chartsinFigures 6.3-Iand6.3-9 will assist with deciding which calculation procedures aretobepursued. Thestepsarenumbered sequentially toallow easy reference with theaccompanying discussions in Sections 6.3.2, 6.3.3 and6.3.4.

Distribution extension inthis manner assumes that thevalues ofrain rate andattenuation remain thesame asthemeasured values, ontheaverage, for times oftheyear different than themeasurement period. This isnot necessarilyso. Thephysical distributionofraindrops along thepropagation path inastratiformrain, forexample, differs from thedistribution ina mild convective storm. Both conditions could produce local rainfall atthe same rate, buttheattenuation produced could bequite different. Thus in regions where there iswide seasonalvariation inhowrain falls, distribution extension shouldbeused with caution. Thereliability oftheextended distribution depends onhow\"typical\" ofthewhole year therainfall was during themeasurement period. Iftheshapesofthelimited-time andthe long-term distribution curves aresimilar, thelimited-time sample is statistically significant andthedistributionextension will bevalid. 6.3.4.3FrequencyScaling.

The bottom curve inthefigure isthemeasured distribution ofrain rate forthe entire six-month period (265,000 minutes).

This translates tochange ofrain rate from 50mm/hrto 57mm/hr inone second.Assuming this change inrain rate, therate ofchange ofattenuation would have been 4dB/sec at20GHz. Moremoderaterates, 0.1dB/secat15GHz, arethehighest rates reported byHodge (1974) andStrickland (1977). 6.3.7 Worst-Month Statistics Worst-month statisticsareofinterest tothose faced with designing asystem tomeet performance criteria expressed interms ofapercentage of anycalendar month, orofanycontiguous 30-dayperiod.

Todeterminetheworst month, itis suggested that thefrequency ofthunderstorms (available from theU.S. Climatological Data Sheets ortheCanadian Mdnthly Summary) beplotted per month. This isanapproximate technique that assumes themost intense rain rates occur duetoconvective rain systems, andthethresholds ofinterest are athigh rain rates.

Todate simulated measurements have been carried outinthelaboratory (Ahmed andAuchterlouis-1976). At10GHzand concentrations ofsand anddust lessthan 10-5g/m3themeasured specific attenuation waslessthan 0.1dB/km forsand and0.4dB/km forclay. Severe storms have concentrations exceeding these values. Ghobrial, etal(1978) have calculated atheoretical specific attenuation forsand. Based onthecharacteristics ofparticles collected during sandstorms, they conclude that negligible attenuation issuffered by X-band transmissions through sandstorms. This isduetothesmall particle size compared tothewavelength andthelowloss tangent forsand. Blowing sandandduststormsoccurinsomeregions oftheU.S. These arerecorded bytheWeather Service aspart oftheLocal Climatological Data (LCD) atthe291:stations. Ground stations needing this information should review thedata recorded byanearbyLCDrecording station. Thevertical extent ofthese sandstormsisunknown, butitseems unlikely that high concentrations would exceed 1km. Thepath length is expected tovary between 1/2and3 km,generally resulting inatotal additional attenuation duetosand oftheorder of1dBorless. Nomeasured satellite beacon linkdata isavailable toconfirm these results. 6.5 PREDICTION OFPATH DIVERSITY FOREARTH-SPACE PATHS 6.5.1TheDiversityConcept 6.5.1.1PathDiversity.

Furthermore, these rain cells donotoccur immediately adjacent tooneanother. Thus, onemight expect that the probability ofsimultaneous fading ontwopaths tospatially separated earth terminals would belessthan that associated with either individual path. This hypothesis wastested first byWilson (1970) using radiometric noise emission measurements todetermine therain attenuation onseparated paths and byHodge (1974a) using actual earth-space paths. These andother ensuing experiments have clearly demonstrated that path diversity isaneffective technique forimproving system reliability inthepresence ofrain attenuation. Atypical path diversity earth terminal configuration isshown in Figure 6.5-1 along with thedefinitions which will beused inthelater discussions. Theparameters aredefined asfollows: AZ=azimuth ofearth-space path (degrees) EL=elevation ofearth-space path (degrees) d'=separation between earth terminals (km) B'=orientation ofearth terminal baseline (degrees 0sB<180) =major axis ofpredominant rain cell orientation (degrees 0s¢<180) 6.5.1.2 OtherDiversitYConcepts. Sixalternative approaches (Brandinger-lg78 andEngelbrecht-1979) have also been suggestedastechniques forimproving reliability inthepresence ofrain attenuation. Thefirst, angle diversity, uses oneground sitewith more than oneearth-space path to satellites located inseparated orbitalpositions; thus, thepaths are orientedalong different azimuths. Ifarain cell islocated ononepath at some distance from theterminal, theresult will bequite similar tothat for path diversity; however, ifarain cell islocated near theterminal, little improvement results. This approach isnotaseffective aspath diversity but mayfind utilityincases where multiple satellites areavailable. Thesecondapproach, frequency diversity,isbased onthefrequency dependence ofrainfall attenuation. Inthis case channel assignments both 255 \\ l RAINCELLORIENTATION \\1 I I Figure 6.5-1.

Theremaining fourapproaches are(Engelbrecht-1979): 1)transmitter powerdiversity 2)signal bandwidth diversity 3)transmission delayortemporary datastorage diversity 4) spacecraftantenna gain diversity. Transmitterpower diversityinvolves adjustingtheground station (uplink) power tomaintain thepower level atthesatellite.Onthe satellite,this requires increasing thedown-link power toovercomethe highest attenuation observedbyanyoneoftheground stations itserves simultaneously. Bandwidth diversitytrades offsignal power inaccordancewith the channel capacity relation involving thesignalbandwidth. Transmitterdelaydiversity ispossiblewhen real-time operationiS notmandatory. Inthis case data istemporarily storedduring thefade and transmitted Iater. Spacecraft antennagaindiversity utilizesanadaptivespacecraft antenna tocompensate forthetemporal andspatialfade variations. Clearly this technique involves sophisticatedantennahardwareaboardthespacecraft. Todateonlypathdiversityhasbeen experimentally verifiedby propagationresearchers, butsystemdesignersmaywell want toconsider any combination ofallofthediversityoptions.Obviously complexity and additional cost playamajor role intheultimate decision touseany diversity technique. These factors arenotconsidered further inthis document. 257 6.5.2DiversityGain andDiversity Advantage Inordertocharacterize theperformance ofadiversity system, itis convenient toestablish adescriptive parameter forthis purpose.

Definition ofDiversity Gain andDiversity Advantage 259 Inthepreceding discussion, ithasbeen implicitly assumed that the fade distributions associated with each individual earth terminal were identical. However, inactual practice this isseldom thecase. These distributions maydiffer because themeasurement period isnotlong enough for thespatial rainfall distribution tobecome uniform; inthis case the differences between thedistributions areanindication oftheuncertainty of themeasurement. Alternatively, local climatological variations maygive rise toreal differences between distributions measured onlyafewkilometers apart; very little isknown definitively about this latter effect. In general, however, since there islittle ornobasis togive greater weight to onedistribution over another, thedefiQitions given ineqs. 6.5-1 and6.5-2 should begeneralized forexperimental data analysis to: GD(A)=Aave(T) -Adiv(T )(6.5-3) Tave(A) I(A) =Tdiv(A )(6.5-4) where Aave(T) istheaverage ofthesingle terminal fade depth exceeded for thepercentage time, T,andTave(A) istheaverage ofsingle terminal percentages oftime exceeded atthefade level A. Allnutt(1978)hasattempted toutilizeboth thediversitygain and diversity advantage forcomparing sets ofdiversitydata. Using thesame data sets Allnutt shows that thediversitygain presentation allowed trends and similarities tobeobserved, whereas plotting thediversityadvantage from the same data gave highly scattered results.

Incases where multiple measurements arereported, therange ofthe appropriate parameters isindicated. Afifth method, rapid response raingauges, hasbeen attempted, buthasnotbeen accurate forpredicting diversity gain. Thetworeasons cited (Allnutt-1978) are: 1)therainfall rate ontheground cannot beaccurately converted toarainfall rate onthe path, and2)therainfall-rate model giving thedrop-size distribution isnot accurate enough tocalculate theattentuation onthepath. 6.5.4 Path Diversity DesignFactors 6.5.4.1 Separation Distance. Diversity gain depends strongly upon theearth terminal separation distance, d'.Thediversity gain increases rapidly asd' isincreased over asmall separationdistance, i.e., uptoabout 10km; thereafter thegain increases more slowly until amaximum value isreached, usually between about 10and30km(Fig. 6,5-3). This maximum value is generally quite close tothat value associated with uncorrelated fading atthe individual earth terminals.i_iii_ _:.,•. ,f]: i. ,...\" •o Incontrast totheuncorrelatedcase, onemayargue that correlated fading mayoccur forpaths separated bydistances associated with typical rain cell separation distances. Such aneffect maybeinferred from therainfall statistics ofFreeny andGabbe (1969); however, these statistics are associated with point rainfall rates rather than path average rainfall rates. Again, nodefinitive report ofthis effect hasbeen published todate. 6.5.4.2 Baseline Orientation. Theperpendicular separation between parallel paths isgreatest when theearth terminals arelocated onabaseline perpendicular totheprojections ofthepaths ontheearth's surface. This arrangement minimizes thepossibility ofboth paths passing through thesame rain cell. Nevertheless, thedependence ofdiversity gain onbaseline orientation isquite weak except, possibly, forvery short separation distances. 262 4D 20 18 16 z.12 6 4 2 0 24681012141618202224 SITESEPARATION DISTANCE, d'(km) Figure6.5-3.

Itisanticipated that theorographic effects will overshadowthese orientation effects. Thebaseline orientation problem isfurther complicated ifspatial anisotropy oftherain cells, i.e., apreferred direction ofrain cell elongation, isknown toexist intheregion ofinterest. Inthis case, a baseline orientationperpendicular tothepreferred axis ofrain cell orientation would bedesirable ifthedirection ofthepropagation path were ignored. Considering bothfactors together, itappears that themost desirable baseline orientationisthat which bisects thelarger ofthetwoangles between theprojection ofthepropagation path andthepreferred axis ofrain cell orientation.\"LC.: :.._ ,... . ::.::,. 41 .•-.\". i .-./ i. 6.5.4.3PathElevation Angle. Theseparationdistance required toachieve a given levelofdiversity gain increases asthepath elevation angle decreases (Hodge-1978). Thisisduetotheincreased likelihood ofpath intersections with rain cells atlower elevation angles. This effect iscoupled tothe problem ofrain cell anisotropy andpath azimuth asnotedbelow. Stated differently, thediversitygain decreases with decreasingelevation angle (Allnutt-1978). 6.5.4.4Path Azimuth Angle. Forsynchronoussatellites thepath azimuth and elevation angles arenotindependent, and, thus, thedependenceofdiversity performance onthese variables cannot befully separated. Ifallrain cells were isotropic, onewould expect novariation indiversity performance with azimuth angle otherthan that associated with theelevation angles. However, when rain cell anisotropy isconsidered, there appears tobeaweak improvement indiversity performance forpath azimuths inthesoutherly compass _adrant (inthenorthern hemisphere) that doesnotcontain the preferred axis ofrain cell orientation.!/ 264 ............ \"....................... • L I6.5.4.5Link Frequency.

Experimental measurements todate have shown no significant dependency ofdiversity gain onthelink frequency (Goldhirsh and Robison-1975) over the10-30 GHzfrequency. Certainly theprobability ofa given attenuation level being exceeded onasingle path isstronglyfrequency dependent. However, diversity gain isaconditional statistic based upon the difference between singleterminal anddiversity attenuation levels. However, forlinkfrequencies above 30GHz, attenuation onboth paths simultaneously duetouniformrain systems canbesufficient tocause asignificant attenuation. This results inanapparent frequency threshold tothediversity gain (Kaul-1980) andwill bediscussed below. 6.5.4.6Anisotropy ofRain Cells Alon9aFront. There isatendency for convective rain cells associated with frontal activity tooccur inbands nearlyperpendicular tothedirection ofmovement ofthefront. Thedirection ofmotion ofthecells within such aband tends tobealong orslightly ahead ofthedirection ofthefront, and, furthermore, themore intense cells tend toelongat eintheir direction ofmotion (Harrold andAustin-1974). Thus, two types ofanisotropy areevident. Thefirst isassociated with theelongation ofindividual cells andisrelated totheprobability ofparallel paths passing through thesamecells. Thesecond isassociated with thestatistics ofthevector separation between rain cells andisassociated with the probability ofparallel paths simultaneously intersecting twodifferent rain cells. Fortunately, these twopreferred orientations arenearly parallel, and thus thesame corrective action isrequired ineach case. Namely, the baseline orientation should benearly perpendicular tothese preferred directions. 6.5.4.7 Local Climatology. Toafirst orderofapproximation itiscommonly assumed that theprobabilities ofrain cell occurrence areuniformly distributedover rather large regions oftheearth's surface. This assumption maybeinvalidated bythepresence ofanyoneofthefollowing features: mountains, large valleys, large bodies ofwater, orurbanheat \"islands\". These features cangive rise tononuniform spatialdistributionsofrain cell probabilities. Spatial distributions ofrainfall accumulation arereadily available inthemeteorological literature; however, itisnotcurrently known whether 265 theuseofthese data isapplicable tothequestion ofearth terminal siting. Forexample, itmaybeargued that these rainfall accumulations aredominated bylowrainfall rates andthus donotreflect thespatial distributions of intense rain cells which dominate theoccurrence ofhigh attenuation levels on earth-space paths. 6.5.4.8Switching Rates.

Theimplementation ofapath diversity system must incorporate aconnecting linkbetween thetwoearth terminals. Ifthis link isclosed, i.e., waveguide, coax, etc., itsperformances will beindependent ofmeteorological variables andWill notdirectlyinfluence thereliability improvement provided bytheuseofpath diversity. If,however, the connecting link operates above 10GHzintheatmosphere, thejoint fading statisticsoftheconnecting linkwith theearth-space paths must be considered.

Thus onemay conjecture that further improvement might result from theaddition of additional diversity paths. Determination ofdiversity gain forNdiversity terminals showsthat most ofthegain isrealized fortwoterminals with very little further increase ingain foradditional terminals (Hodge-1974b). 6.5.5AnEmpiricalModel 6.5.5.1 Description oftheModel. Thedataavailable from early diversity experiments inNewJersey andOhio (Hodge-1974a, Wilson-1970, Wilson and 266 Mammel-1973, Gray-1973) wereusedtodevelop anempirical modelforthe dependence ofdiversity gainonseparation distance, d',andsingle site attenuation, A(Hodge-1976a).

Toavoid theproblems described above, Kaul (1980) hasintroduced meteorological considerations which establish practical limits onthecoefficient a'dependingonA,f,Band other system parameters. Thecoefficient b'isnotmodified because itis related totheintercellular distances established forconvective rain systems. Theextended empirical model considers that diversity gain isonly realized when spatially nonuniform rain intensities (rain rates)occur near theground station.(Aground system imbedded inauniform rain experiences zero diversity gain.) Theconvective (thunderstorm) rains arethebest example ofthese types ofnon-uniformrain systems.RiceandHolmberg (1973) describedthese rain types analytically asMode 1(thunderstorm) andMode 2 (stratiform) rains (seeSection 3.2).Using theRice andHolmberg model, the cumulative distributionsoftotal rain rate anduniform(Mode 2)rain rate may bedeveloped asshown inFigure6.5-6.

Theeffects occurontime scales shorterthan a minute andonspatialscales shorterthan akilometer. Atlowelevation angles, theamount oftroposphere traversed issignificant, andso,below approximately 10degree elevation angles, low-angle fading must beconsidered. 6.6.1AntennaApertureEffects Theeffectsoftropospheric turbulences andtheantenna cannotbe totally decoupled because, ofcourse, themeasurements andoperatingsystems utilize antennas. Theantenna aperture processes thgincident wavefront with itsspatialandtemporal fluctuations into areceived signalwith only temporal variations. P 279 Wavefront tilt duetoinhomogeneities andgradients inthe refractivity appear totheantenna asanangle-of-arrival variation. Average elevation angle raybending isusually 10times more pronounced than azimuthal raybending. However, wave tilt fluctuations tend toberandomly distributed inangle relative totheslant path propagation direction, atleast when the majority ofthepath isabove theregime ofsurface effects (surface effects extend upwards several hundred meters).i\" C i. i Fluctuationsoccurringonspatialscalessmallerthan thesizeofthe aperture areoften referred toaswavefront ripple. This phase incoherence results inaninstantaneous gain lossordegradation. Thefluctuations describedhereinapply totheground station downlink because itsantenna isinclose proximity totheturbulent medium. Anuplink satellite path will sufferfluctuation gain degradationonly dueto scattering ofenergy outofthepath. Because ofthelarge distance traversed bythewave since leaving thetroposphere, thewave arrives atthesatellite antenna asaplane wave (noripple) andwith onlyminute angle-of-arrival effects.

Paths operating atvery lowelevation angles with narrow beamwidth antennas mayexperience unacceptable fading dueto scintillation andmultipath effects. Therequired reliability mayberegained bytheuseofspaced site diversity. Asite separation greater than 300m transverse tothepropagation path hasbeen suggested (CCIR-1978, Rpt564-1) asnecessary toalleviate severe turbulence-induced effects. Ineffect, separation ontheorder oforlarger than thescale size ofthelargest inhomogeneities inrefractive index along thepropagation path, andespecially near thesurface where refraction isgreatest, results indecorrelation ofthe instantaneous signal fluctuations andhence improved performance.

Thepower spectrum density ofthefluctuations decreases at26.5 dB/decade (see Figure 6.6-6).

Depolarization isalso referred toascross-polarization. Forlinearly polarizedwaves avertically (horizontally) polarized wave will, after passing through amedium, have a horizontally (vertically) polarized component inaddition totheinitial wave. Forcircularly polarizedwaves aRHCP (LHCP) wave will develop into an elliptical wave. Forfrequency reuse systemsbased onpolarization isolation this coupling reduces isolation andincreases \"cross-talk.\" 6.7.1.1 Sources ofDepolarization. Depolarization onearth-space paths has been observeddueinthepresence of •rain •ice •snow • multipath • refractive effects 307 Thesehydrometeor andscatteringeffects generate depolarization because of thenon-spherical shapes ofthehydrometer particles. Forexan_le, as raindrop sizesincrease their shape departs from spherical andbecomes an oblate spheroid with anincreasingly pronounced flat bottom. Forlarge drop sizes aconcave depression develops (Pruppacher andPitter-1971). Polarized microwave energy scattered from these particles caneasily beconverted into anorthogonal polarization.•/ i. 6.7.1.2Measures ofDepolarization. Themeasurement ofdepolarization by propagation researchers usually hasbeen done utilizing orthogonally-polarized feeds onasingle antenna while observing singly-polarized satellite signals. This parameter iscalled thecross-polarization discrimination (XPD) or cross-polarization ratio (XPR) defined as(Bostian, etai-1977) XPD=poweroutputfrom theco-polarized port power outputfrom thecross-polarized port =(XPR)-I Forperfect transmitting andreceiving antennas andaperfect medium this i_olation could become infinite, butwith practical components some leakage is always present."}, {"id": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design__156", "source": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design.pdf", "chunk_index": 156, "text": "utilizing orthogonally-polarized feeds onasingle antenna while observing singly-polarized satellite signals.

Chu(1980)hasfound linear relations between theXPDandfrequency throughout the10to30GHzfrequency range. Specifically, XPD(expressed as anumericalratio) isdirectly proportional tofrequency forafixed rain rate, andisinversely proportional tofrequency forafixed value ofrain attenuation. Bostian (1979b) confirms this linear relation between the XPD(fl) andXPD(f 2)from hismonthly COMSTAR data for1978, but,the value XPD(f2)/XPD(fl) varies from month tomonth. 6.7.2.3Elevation AngleDependence ofDepolarization. IntheU.S. andCanada depolarization measurements have been obtainedatelevation angles from 24.6o inOttawa (McEwan-1977) to49oatAustin, Texas (Vogel-1978). Thegeneral dependenceofXPDversus Aonelevation angle ecanbeobtained from the theoretical results ofNowland, etal(1977a). Note that both thecoefficient aandthetotal attenuation Adepend onelevation angle. Theelevation angle dependent results ofNowland, etal(1977b) 11.7 GHz(experimentaldata) areshowninFigure 6.7-4. Clearly the coefficient iselevation angle dependent, however theexperimental data does notconfirm this fact. The_coefficient appears tobenearly independent of elevation angle anddoes appear toagree with thelimited data base. Chu(1980) hasobservedthat thedifferential propagation constant fordepolarization isgoverned byacos2e relation. However theXPD dependenceonelevation angle must also take theeffective path lengtheffect into account (Chu-1974). 315 60 FREQ.- 11GHz OEXPERIMENTAL, 11.7GHz POLARIZATION -RHCP _ DATAOFNOWLAND, etal .... 4.3 CANTING ANGLE DISTRIBUTION, XXUSINGLe12_2R m,=0.84 []''\"0 CCIR(PROPOSED) _ 50 . =f .77 w, 3o I I J 0 20 40 60 80 ELEVATION ANGLE (DEGREES)!;. i _,.. 25 N eL X' z_< (b)_3=o < > lSm m m mud ! m mud i m,m 0(SAMEASABOVE) BLACKSBURG, VA O mm maulumqullm quup Ul_ anllm qulam m aimOlin m amqm | B_CKSBURG, VA OAUSTIN, TEXAS •-\"......\"_\"0\"\"_'O'\"- ......-_\"......._.A OTTAWA OBLACKSBURG, VA 19_ I I I I 20 40 60 80 ELEVATION ANGLE(DEGREES) Figure 6.7-4 ElevationAngle Dependence oftheCoefficientsinthe"}, {"id": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design__160", "source": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design.pdf", "chunk_index": 160, "text": "> lSm m m mud ! m mud i m,m 0(SAMEASABOVE) BLACKSBURG, VA O mm maulumqullm quup Ul_ anllm qulam m aimOlin m amqm | B_CKSBURG, VA OAUSTIN, TEXAS •-\"......\"_\"0\"\"_'O'\"- ......-_\"......._.A OTTAWA OBLACKSBURG, VA 19_ I I I I 20 40 60 80 ELEVATION ANGLE(DEGREES) Figure 6.7-4 ElevationAngle Dependence oftheCoefficientsinthe Cross-Polari zationDiscriminationRelation 316 6.7.2.4PhaseVariationsDuringRain-Induced Depolarization Events. At Blacksburg, VA(Bostian, etal-1977) measurements have been made ofthephase difference between theco-polarized signal components. This phase difference hasbeen observed toboth decrease andincrease byabout 150degrees for3dB fades andthen notchange significantly forhigher attenuations. Thephase difference hasalso been observed toincrease andthen decrease inthesame storm. Themechanism forthis plateau at150degrees andwhythesign changes remains unexplained. 6.7.3 Ice-Cr_stal Depolarization 6.7.3.1 Meteorological Presence ofIce. Icecrystals form around dust particles inshapes influenced bytheambient temperature. Incirrus clouds they mayexist foranindefinite time, butincumulonimbus clouds theyfollow acycle ofgrowth bysublimation, falling andmelting inthelower reaches of thecloud (Bostian andAllnutt-1979). Radio, radar andoptical observations allconfirm that cloud icecrystals possess some degree ofpreferred orientation related totheorientation oftheelectrostatic field. The crystals range insizefrom 0.1tolmm andconcentrations range from 103to 106crystals/m 3.Thevariation inconcentration andoccurrence ofevents maybeduetothevariation of\"seed\" nuclei invarious airmasses. For example continental airmasses contain more dust nuclei thanmaritime air masses andsooccurrences ofice-crystal depolarization occur more frequently atinland ground stations. This general trendhas been observed between observations attheVirginia Polytechnic Institute andState University (inland, most frequent), University ofTexas atAustin (intermediate) andBell Telephone Laboratories (maritime, least frequent). 6.7.3.2 Ice-Cr_stal Depolarization Measurements. Iceparticles well above theheight ofthemelting layer mayhave significant cross-polarization effects even forsmall values ofattenuation (typically below 3to5dBat 11.7 GHz). This effect isbelieved tocontribute tothepoor correlation between theexcess attenuation andthecross-polarization discrimination at these lowvalues ofattenuation. 317 ), L._. i F.

Snowdepolarization occursduring both the winter andsummermonths. During thesummermonths snow existsabove the O°Cisotherm. During winter, astheisotherm lowers, thethickness ofthe snow layer increases andthedepolarization duetorain decreases. s InCanada {Hendry, etai-1976)tests usingcircularlypolarlzed diversity radars atfrequencies near 2.9GHz{I0.4 cmwavelength) and16.7GHz {1.8cmwavelength) atanelevationangleof3.2degrees have diagnosed storms during both summerandwinter. During June snowoccurred during astormfrom 2.6to8.2kmaltitude andyielded adifferential phase shiftof0.36 deg/km at2.9GHz. Winter data taken at16.7GHzgave more variable results of0.16 to1.17 deg/km formoderate toheavy snowstorms ranging inaltitude from 70m to2.6km. Themean value ofdifferential phase shiftwas0.69 deg/km at16.7 GHz. 321 a z <._l 0 ZlU8P'13A:ll:l(]V:lYVlOdO0 0 05,-I 3228P'NOIJ.YNII_III:IOSI(] UY'lOdS$Ol:lOI 6.7.4.2Multipath Depo|arization. Thecross-polarized pattern ofaparabolic reflector antenna normally hasitspeak atsmall angles off-axis. This allows oblique indirect rays, which maybepresent onearth-space paths atlow elevation angles,toproduceasignificantcross-polarized component. Measurements have beenmade onterrestrial links at11GHz (Watson, et al-lg73) and22GHz(Turner-1973). Themagnitude oftheindirect signal reflected from theearth canberoughly estimated from thedata inLord and Oliver (1946) taken near3GHz. 6.7.4.3 Refractive Effects. Variations intheradio refractivity (dielectric constant oftropospheric layers) cancause rotation ofthepolarization plane oftherays refracting through thelayers. This condition will occur for layers which arenotperpendicular tothevertical plane containing the transmitter andreceiver asdescribed byLeFrancois, etal(1973). 6.7.5Prediction ofDepolarization Statistics Inmost casesdepolarization arisesduetotwosources: rain and ice.

Based onthese results theCPDwill exceed 20dBduring 99.9% oftheyear.L. !. However, forlowattenuation levels (high XPD's), icewill introduce depolarization. Acrude estimate ofthis effect canbemade based onthedata inFigure 6.7-5. Namely, when As1dBabout 30%more XPDevents occur dueto iceandrain, than just rain alone. This translates thedatapoint inFigure 6.7-10 corresponding toA=1dBfrom about 0.18 percent oftheyear to (1.3)(0.18%) =0.23% oftheyear (indicated bya0inFigure 6.7-10). Thus theXPDcurve israised upforlowvalues ofattenuation. Forattenuations above 3dBtherain plus icedepolarization plots areessentially allrain effects. Note that onecould have added intheeffect oficedepolarization by translating thecorresponding rain andiceXPD's. This isprobably less accurate because high values ofXPDareequipment dependent. Therefore an average value of30%icecontribution wasselected rather than converting each 326 valueofXPDusing datashowninFigure 6.7-5. This correction isbased on very preliminary results from asinglegeographic location andshould beadded only toshow atrend, since theabsolute value isprobably inerror. 6.8 ADDITIONAL PROPAGATION FACTORSRELATED TOSYSTEM DESIGN 6.8.1 Contents ofthis Section Several other factors affect trans-tropospheric transmissions from satellites.

Theoretical estimates ofthedegradation of pulse shapesthrough rain have indicated that only minor effects are observed. Thecalculations (Crane-1967) indicated that pulse distortion does notbecome significantuntil total rain attenuations oftheorder of100dB areencountered. Since current linkmargins donotallow suchhigh attenuations, thelinkwill fail duetosignalattenuation before thepulse shape affects transmission. Amplitude variationwith frequency becomes significant atfrequencies inthevicinity ofmolecular absorption bands, such asthe50-70 GHzoxygen absorption band. Thegreatest dispersiveeffectwould occur attheindividual absorption lines which arequitenarrow (Liebe -1975). However, duetothe great pathattenuation present atthese frequencies, itisnotlikely they would beusedforearth-space communications.

Except forfade depths in excess of20dB,theaccuracy oftheattenuation measurements is+_idB. These rain fade results, while representative ofthose taken atRosman, donot appear tobesufficiently accurate fordeepfades because thesignal levels approach thenoise floor ofthereceiver. Forone-minuteaverages, no measurable selective fading wasobserved (WEC-1977). Thecross-correlation of4a_d6GHzsignalsduetolowangle fading intheCanadian arctic wasfound tobelow(Strickland, etai-1977). During a 2.5hour period onthedaywhen thefading wasmost severe thecorrelation coefficient was0.34 since the6GHzsignal experienced 55%more fades than the4GHzsignal. This would indicate adispersion waspresent,butthe mechanism forthis effect istropospheric refraction andnotrain. Frequency selectivefading maybesignificant atlowelevation angles. 6.8.2.2PhaseVariations. Phasemeasurements have notyielded significant results forfrequencies above 10Gflz. Thephase coherent sidetone signals on ATS-6 showedonlyminor variations across the1.44 GHzbandwidths. These variations were most evident fortheshorter (one andfour second) averaging periods compared totheone-minute period (WEC-Ig77). Phasemeasurements havebeenattempted fortheonedegreeelevation angle satellitesobserved from thearctic (Strickland etai-1977). Unfortunately, nosignificantfade events occurred andnodifferential phase variations were recorded. Phase effectsareproduced bythemolecular absorption mechanism along with amplitude effects. Large values ofphase dispersionwould therefore beexpected intheabsorption bands. 6.8.3Ionospheric Effects onBandwidth Coherence 6.8.3.1Amplitude Variations.Ionospheric attenuation isinversely proportional tothefrequency squared (Millman-1958) andisgenerally less than 0.001 dBat15GHzandanelevation angle 0=90°.Thevariation is 331 ............ •..... ,........................ \"........ •...... •...... ...... ............ :,,.'. approximately related tocosecant O.Theattenuation istherefore usually less than"}, {"id": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design__167", "source": "nasa-propagation-effects-handbook-sat-sys-design.pdf", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "along with amplitude effects.

Byassuming that thetroposphere isisothermal, andthat absorption andemission arethe onlymechanisms present, this equation canbereduced toasimple relation between theantenna temperature (skynoise temperature) andtheattenuation along anearth-space path: where Tsistheskynoise temperature, Tmisthemean absorption temperature oftheattenuating medium andAisthespecific attenuation times theeffective path length. Temperatures areindegrees Kelvin. Thevalue Tm=1.12(surfacetemperature inOK)-50°K hasbeen empirically determined (Wulfsberg-1964). AsTsincreases toward Tm,theradiometer tends tosaturate. Fortypical values ofminimum temperature resolution, (T)rms ,theradiometer canonly accurately measure to10or15dBattenuation levels. Inverting this relation yields theresulting skytemperature fora given path attenuation A(indB)of Ts=Tm[1-10('A110) 1 This relation maynowbeutilized forestimation oftheskytemperatures using thedata inSection 6'3ofthis report fortheattenuation A. 6.8.4.1.1 Clear AirSkyNoise.

During the Calibrations theattenuation duetothetroposphere isusually cancelled out bycomparing theskynoise onthestar andsubtractingtheadjacent (dark) sky noise. Thus theattenuation-induced skynoise cancels out. 6.8.5 Noise ObservedbySatellite-Borne Receivers Receiving(uplink)antennas aboard spacecraftObservethewarm earth ortheearth's cloud cover.

Stated interms ofthepresent problem, thesystem engineer uses propagation andother technical data to achieve asystem design that will meet therequirements specified bythe user. These requirements arespecified interms ofagross quantitative need (e.g., number ofchannels), aquantitative expression ofperformance (e.g., percent oftime available), and, sometimes, more qualitative expressions (e.g., \"highly reliable\"). Even though both thepropagation data andthe requirements areoften expressed interms ofcumulative probability distributions, itisnotalways straightforward torelate onedistribution to theother. Thecorrespondence between agiven propagation phenomenon and system performance maybecomplex. Thepurpose ofthis chapter istorelate propagation data tosystem performance parameters.

Analyze systemperformance, first atthepath level, then onthe end-to-end performance level. 10) Ifperformancemeetsrequirements closely, stop.Otherwise, adjust design andrepeat analysis. Ifdesigncannot bemade to meet requirements, consider changing requirements. Performancecriteria typically dealwith baseband quality, ordigital error rates, whereas thepower budgets relate physical systemparameters to CNR(orequivalents suchasS/N,Eb/No, C/kT, etc.). Therefore, the baseband ordigital performance criteria must befunctionally related toCNR bymeans ofmodulation performance equations. Gross design isperformed bymeans ofelementary power budget analysis andfree-space (orclear air)propagation characteristics. Basic choices aremade atthis point, suchasselection ofmodulation andmultiple access techniques. Itisassumed that thereader isfamiliar with these techniques andpower budget analysis (Northrop-1966). This analysis establishes arelationship between basic system•parameters andthesignal-or carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)onagiven transmission path. 352 IbThesystem performance requirements, which apply toend-to-end performance, aresuballocated tovarious system components. Most important, therelationship oftheend-to-end communication performance tothat ofeach ofthelinks must bedetermined. Forexample, theactual received CNRisa composite which mayinclude both up]ink anddownlink noise contributions. The end-to-end availability involves availabilities ofeach path. Since rain induced attenuation isthemost severepropagation effect forthefrequencies ofinterest, thenext step intheprocedure isto Calculate arainmargin. Ifthesystem usessite diversity, some ofthis rain margin maybeoffset by\"diversity gain.\" Theremaining margin isthen applied totheinitial system parameters. Typically, themargin isapplied as anincrease inpower; butitisalso possible toincrease antenna gains or modify themodulation parameters. Atthis point, arough design hasbeen achieved. This levelofdetail andaccuracy maybesufficientifthe objective isonly todetermine system feasibility. Formore accurate results, theeffects ofother propagation phenomena.must beconsidered. Except for depolarization, these effects aregenerally additive interms ofmargin.

Ifso,thedesign process isessentially completed*. Ifnot, the system parameters and/or theperformance criteria aremodified, andthe analysis procedure isrepeated. Tosome, theidea that thecriteria are subject tochange isdisturbing. Within physical (andeconomic) constraints, itispreferable tomodify only thetechnical system parameters. Butthere maybecases where theinitial performance goals areunrealistic. For example, itsimply maynotbeworth theexpense ofalarge increase inEIRP in order togetacircuit availability ofgg.gg_ forsmall earth terminals at44 GHz.

Theexperienced communication system engineer will probably befamiliar with thematerial covered inthese paragraphs, andmaytherefore skip them without loss ofcontinuity, andconcentrate onparagraphs 7.3.4through 7.3.6,which areaddressed tothemain issue athand, namely thespecific application of propagation data. 7.2. COMMUNICATIONSYSTEM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 7.2.1 Introduction Criteria forcommunication systemperformance represent attempts to quantify the\"reliability or\"quality\" oftheservice.Twomethods, applying different probabilistic notions, aregenerally used.Thefirst method isto regard someindicator ofcommunication quality(e.g., CNR) asarandom variable andspecify values ofitsinverse cumulative distribution function, ortheprobability that agiven value isexceeded.

Thefirst type ofperformance criterion, which will betermed availabilit 7criterion, isgenerally specified asthepercentage oftime that athreshold value isexceeded (ornotexceeded), rather than aprobability. Thisisnatural,sincewhat wecanmeasure ispercentageoftime, andnot probability. (Ergodicity allows thes_ tobeassumed equivalent). Avail ability criteria areinwide use, andthebulk oflong-term performance data analysis hasbeen done from anavailability standpoint. However, such criteria anddata donotgive anyinformation about thetime-variation of performance. Inmany situations,itisdesirable toknow something about how fast theperformance maychange. Some temporal information isgiven bya slightly modified availability criterion, inwhich atime period is specified. Forexample, thecriterion could state that agiven level ofnoise will notbeexceeded formore than acertain percentageofan_month. However, theconnection between suchacriterion andanyquantitative temporal description isobscure. Thesecondtype ofperformance criterion, which expressly describes thetemporal behavior, such asmean outageduration, will betermed outo._.a=qe statistics. Beside theOutageduration,suchstatisticsmight include the distribution function forthetime until thenext outage,given that anoutage isjust over. Orthey might probabilistically describediurnal orseasonal performance variations. Inthelimit, suchstatisticswould give the autocorrelation function orthespectral densityoftheprocess. Asyet, the available data doesnotcoveralong enoughtime span tobestatistically reliable. Wewill therefore confine ourattention primarilytoperformance criteria that specifyavailability, rather than outage statistics. Thereareseveralsourcesofperformancecriteria. Among themore generally accepted standards arethose promulgatedbytheInternational Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR). Telecommunication systemsforU.S. commercial useconform tostandards similarbutnotidentical totheCCIR's.These criteria areexpressed interms ofabaseband noise level (analog) oranerror 355 rate degradation (digital)nottobeexceeded more than some small percentage Ofthetime inanymonth (typically, .001to0.3%).

Theprimary measure ofcircuit or transmission quality fordigital systems isthebiterror rate (BER). Semantically, weuse\"bit\" error rate because theoverwhelming majority of digital communications systems transfer binary data streams.* Biterror rate usuallY applies over amoderately short term, andnormally •does not incorporate \"errors\" oroutages ofduration longer than afewtens ofbits.!.. Formost digital systems, thebiterrop probability canbeexpressed asafunction oftheenergy-per-bit tonoise power spectral density ratio (Eb/No). These relationships areavailable forthetheoretical performance ofcommonly used modulation andcoding systems from anygood communication theory reference (e;g., Schwartz, etal-1966 andSpilker-lg77). Thetheoretical BEPvs.Eb/Norelations usually assume white, Gaussian noise. Inthepresence ofnon-white ornon-Gaussian noise,or interference, these relations arenotaccurate. Itisnowbecoming common to express theperformance ofactual systems interms oftheEb/Norather than CNR. Eb/Noisnumericallyequal totheratio ofsignal power to noise power within a(noise) bandwidth equal inhertz tothedigital bitrate inbits persecond. (Note that bitrate isnotingeneral thesame assymbol rate.) Forexample, the(theoretically ideal) performance ofbinary PSK modulation requires anEb/Noof9.6dBforaBERof10-5. *Weshouldalso distinguishbetweenbiterror rate, which defines theactual performance, andmust bemeasured byaveragin_--6_er asequence ofbits communicated, andthebiterror probability (BEP), which isatheoretical concept that canapply even toasingle bit. BERwill beusedhere, since itismore common, eventhoughBEPistechnically more correct. 356 •\" ............. ,....................................... : :....... ....... ....... Inthecase ofdigital systems usedtoaccommodate fundamentally analog requirements (e.g.,PCMvoice channels), there exists athreshold error rate atwhich circuit quality isconsidered unacceptable.

Rather, thedata isoften formatted inblocks orpackets. Inmany cases, then, theperformance requirement isspecified interms oftheprobability ofanerror free block, which might typically contain 1000ormore bits. Iftheonly type of transmission imperfection istherandomly occuring biterror process, then the block error performance canbecalculated from thebiterror rate: Probability oferror free block ofnbits =P(ZI,n) =(1-BER)n.However, theblock error performance maybeinfluenced bytheprobability oflonger outages, losses ofsynchronization, andthelike, which arenotusually included intheBER. Insystems usedtotransfer well-defined messages, otherperformance criteria mayberequired. Inthemost general case where ablock iscomposed ofmany messages, thesystem performance requirements could include amessage performance criterion, ablock transmission performance criterion andabit error rate. Note that consistency among thevarious criteria ismandatory. Forexample, ablock error performance of99_(i.e., ggoutof100blocks are error free) for1000-bit blocks could notbeachieved when thebiterror rate is10-4. Indata communications systems where real time delivery isnot critical, theconcept ofthroughput isoften used. Itisimplicit that the system involves areturn channel path overwhich acknowledgments and/or requests forretransmission aremade. Thethroughput isdefined (Brayer - 1978) astheratio ofthenumber ofinformation bits transmitted (K)tothe 357 total numberofbits (including overhead andre-transmissions), n,before the block isaccepted. Thethroughput isapproximately K{I-P(->I,n)]/n This approximation forthroughputasafunction ofblock error rate applies onlywhen thereturn channel iserror free. Brayer (1978) makes acase for using message deliverydelay asthemost important criterion, rather than throughput itself. However, they arerelatdd closely. Insummaryitcanbeseen that throughput andblock error rate are directly related. Biterror rate contributes amajor, butnotalways the only, portion oftheblockerror rate.

Transmission system criteria areusually defined onan end-to-end, reference circuit basis. Ifthesatellitesystem isonly a portion ofthis end-to-end path, asub-allocation must bemade tothe satellite segment. Also, when thesystem isusedforrelay ofmultichannel voice trunks, theconversion from baseband (voice channel) performance criteria totheradio frequency criteria (i.e., C/N) involves assumptions about channel loadingandmodulation parameters. Forexample, foranFDM-FM system, thenoise inpicowatts, psophometrically weighted (pWOp), inavoice channel is(GTE-1972) where C F _f fch==RFinput power indBm =receiver noise figure, dB =peak deviation ofthechannel fora1kHztest tone signal center frequency ofthechannel inthebaseband Similar equations apply tosinglechannel FMvoice andFMvideo, andtoother modulation structures. pWOp isoneofmany noise measures inuse. Specifically, dBrnc (dBabove reference noise,C-message weighting. Reference noiseisequivalent inpower toa1,000 hertz tone at-go dBm.) dBa (dBabove reference noise-adjusted, FIAweighting. Reference noiseadjusted isequivalent inpower toa1,000 hertz tone at-85dBm.) pWp (picowatts ofnoise power, psophometrically weighted.) 359 dBmOp (psophometrically weighted noise powerindB,with respect toapower levelof0dBm.) Theseunitsrepresent absolute valuesofnoise.Byappending a\"0\" toeach (e.g., pWOp), thesame units serve asmeasure ofnoise relative to0 level signal(i.e., 0dBm).

FMlinks areoftenengineered sothat thereceiver FMthreshold value ofC/Nisatorwithin afewdBofthat value which gives theabsolutely minimum acceptable performance.Thatis,thereceiver RFperformance threshold andthebaseband (acceptable) performance threshold arematched. Asanexample ofalong-term performance objective,thelatest CCIR position (reflected inRecommendation 353-3, CCIR-1978) isthat 10,000 pWOp one-minute mean noise power shouldnotbeexceeded more than 20%ofany month. TheoldU.S. criterion forlong intertoll trunks required 20,000 pWOp orless nominal(intheabsence ofafade). Inthecase oftelevision signals, various criteria require aweighted baseband S/Noffrom 50to59dB toexist undernominalconditions. Noise performancerequirements forsmall percentages canbethought ofas\"outage\" conditions. TheCCIR recommendation isthat 1,000,000 pWO (unweighted) measured with a5ms.integration time, exist notmore than 0.01% ofanyyear. Anintermediate requirement isalsoestablished: that 50,000 pWOpone-minutemean power notbeexceeded formore than 0.3_ ofanymonth. IntheU.S., acriterion of316,000 pWOp for.02%ofthetime isoften e_loyed. DCAstandardssimilarly require that 316,000 pWOp notbeexceeded formore than 2minutes inanymonth norforoneminute inanyhour. Video threshold requirements aretypically inthe33to37dBweighted signalto noise ratio range.i• i i i ,. i !- t\"0 36O Criteria areunderconstant revision. Indeed, there arearguments suggesting that newapplications require specialized criteria. Current criteria, developed forterrestrial systems orforsatellite communications systems below 10GHz, maynotbe applicable formillimeter wave systems where thestatistics differ appreciably. Note that outagecriteria, such astheoneDCAhaspromulgated (probability ofoutage onafive minute call), arevery different from nominal orlong-term availability criteria. Because propagation outages inthe frequency range ofinterest typically have durations ontheorder ofmagnitude ofminutes, itisnotstraightforward torelate availability statistics to outage probability statistics. Some approximations maybemade from rain statistical data andlimited data onfade depth vs.duration, butmore theoretical andexperimental work appears tobenecessarybefore such outage criteria canbereliably applied indesign.Inthis Handbook, therefore, we have found itnecessary toemphasize availability criteria.

Ontheother hand, large phase scintillations that occur infrequently will addtotheoutage time calculation, providing: 1)i these events arenotconcurrent with thepredominant cause of outage, namelyamplitude fades (attenuation), and 2)therate ofphase variation ishigh enough that itwill notbe tracked byadigitalsystem, orbefiltered outinananalog system. *Apossible exception isdispersion atfrequencies near theabsorption bands, butthese bands will usually beavoided. 362 !; :_:7.3 DESIGNPROCEDURE 7.3.1 Introduction Theprocedurepresentedinthis Section isageneral one,applicable tosatellitecommunication systemsofconventional design andapplication.

Theprocedureisbased ontime percentage availability oroutage as theprimaryandinitial designcriterion. Emphasis onthis approach is necessitatedbythefact that thelargest amount ofreliable propagation data ispresentedintimepercentage terms. Where othercriteria areimportant, differentprocedures maybenecessary. Buteven where othercriteria are employed, itisexpedient toperform initial gross sizingcalculations according totimepercentage criteria. Aspreviouslynoted,thesystemdesignprocessisnotatrue synthesis. Itconsists rather ofiterative analyses. Thedesignerbegins with somerough \"guesstimates\" ofparameters such asearth terminal antenna size, satelliteRFpower, along with asetofsystemrequirements (coverage area orlocations, capacity, connectivity, andservice criteria). By employing analytic (notsynthetic)procedures, thedesigner determines whether theinitial parameters andtherequirements/criteria areconsistent. Ifnot, additional iterations aremade, with adjustments either totheparameters or totherequirements. This lastpoint isnottrivial: ifthere isalarge disparitybetween calculated systemperformance andtherequirements, itmay benecessary toconsult with thesource oftherequirements andagree toa change (e.g., lower capacity oravailability). Thefinal system design parameters shouldalways beverified inasmany variables aspossible according toavailable data. Thus, although theinitial design mayhave been performed usinganavailability criterion, itmaybeofinterest and importance topredict outage duration statistics,ifthenecessary data are available. 363 7.3.2 Path Performance Versus OverallChannel Performance: Availability ,Allocation Thetypical satellite comunication application involves twoorfour distinct links.

Theuplinkanddownlinkconnecting toagiven earth terminal have highly correlated propagation outagestatistics. Thepropagation effects onpaths between thesatellite andtwo different earth terminals areuncorrelated.

Thefollowing isa simplified version oftheFMmodulation performance equation (see Section 7.2.3): (C/kT)dB=125.8-20log(Af/fch)-10log(pWOp) Fromthis, andthetypical parameters f/fch =1.22, the required values ofC/kT are: pWOp C/kT 10,000 84.1 80 100,000 74.1 99.7 500,000 67.1 N/A(defines outage) Note howeverthat theFMequation onlyapplies above \"threshold.\" Thethreshold values ofC/kT must also be determined. Since this system hasabandwidth ofabout 62 dB-Hz,thethreshold values ofC/kT andthethreshold C/kTB are related: (C/kTB)dB =C/kT-62 Thus,ifthis systemisimplemented with aconventional FM receiver of12dBC/kTBthreshold, aC/kTof74dBwillbeat threshold,andthis becomestheoutagepoint. With anextended threshold demodulator'(6 dBthreshold), the500,000 pWOp outage noiselevel andthedemodulatorthreshold occurataboutthe same point, which isdesirable. Tocomplete thefirst phaseofdesign,itremains toselectinitial values, ranges, orlimitsofsystemparameters. Many ofthese maybeimplied byoverall system requirements, such ascoverage area ortotal number of channels. Others maybeconstrained bycost considerations orachievable levels ofhardware performance.

Ageneral method oftranslating overall performance objectivesinto individual linkobjectives does notexist atthis timeforsatellite systems operating above 10GHz. Techniques have been developed forline-of-sight systems (Parker-1977 andGTE-1972), andsatellite systems atlower frequencies 372 Q,(CSC-1971),butthese have limited application inthepresent case. We present here some design tools that have been used inmillimeter-wave system design. They include rules-of-thumb andsimplifications that often apply, and more detailed procedures useful when thesimplifying assumptions cannot be made. Atthis point inthedesignprocedure wehave twofunctionally related parameters: arequired composite C/Nvalue, andthepercentage of time forwhich this C/Napplies. There maybeseveralpoints ofthis function (the cumulative probability distribution function ofC/N) specified. Atsome smallpercentage oftime, thesystem isconsidered tobeunavailable. Atsome larger percentage oftime, aform of\"degraded\" operationmight bedefined, corresponding toahigher C/Nvalue than theoutageC/N. Thepresent problem isoneofassigning toeach linkofthesystem values ofC/Nandcorresponding time percentages forwhich thevalues must beexceeded. Practically, this usually reduces toallocating outagetime oravailabilities among thelinks comprising thesystem,andallocating C/Nvalues tothelinks inawaythat is both compatible with thelinkoutagetime allocation, andachieves the required overall system performance. 7.3.5.1 Suballocation ofOutages andSignal toNoise Ratio.

Using this outage time suballocation isparticularly appropriate in digital systemswhere only afewdBseparate nominalandbarely acceptable performance. Thenominal performance analyses (not syntheses) areperformed initerations subsequent totheinitial design. These performance analyses must notbeneglected,however, sinceasystemdesign that meets aparticular outageoravailability criterion does notnecessarily meet itsother performance criteria (e.g., nominal performance). This isparticularly important inanalog systemswhere there canbeawide gapbetween what is considered anoutage andwhat isrequired most ofthetime. Since itappears• that most satellitesystems being designed forabove 10GHzaredigital, this difficulty isperhaps• academic. Inpractice, theuseofavailability alone, orinconjunction with outagedurationcharacteristics, isprevalentinthe design ofsuch systems. InTable7.3-1, wegive thesimplifying rules ofthumb which may usually beemployed forsuballocation ofoutage time, TOUT. Intheduplex case, theexact value ofTOUTrelative toitsupper andlower bounds depends onthetype ofrepeater andonthejoint statistics ofoutage(i.e., the correlations between outages). Thelower bound will apply ifaperfect correlation ofoutages exists ontheup-anddownlinktoasingle terminal.

Therain margin istheincrease insystem transmission parameters (such aspower orgain) needed tooffsetthe attenuation caused byrain andother precipitation. Note that since precipitation also increases theeffective noisetemperature ondownlink paths, themargin should include this effect aswell. Ifthesystem employs diversity (particularly, butnotexclusively, space diversity),there isan 381 effective \"diversitygain\" which canbeobtained. This diversity gain canbe subtracted from therainmargin. Allofthese calculations aredescribed in detail inChapter 6ofthis Handbook. The(possibly adjusted) rain margins must beapplied ontheupanddownlinks inaccordance with theperformance suballocation decisions made intheprevious phase. Once again, this isbest il]ustrated through theexamples. Weaddress thedigital system example first. Wewill assume no measured attenuation orrain rate statistics areavailable, andwill usethe analytic estimation technique ofFigure 6.3-1 (theGlobal Model). The location oftheground terminal isinclimate region D3at350Nlatitude andsealevel, andthepath deviation angle is200.Weareinterested in theattenuation at12and14GHzexceeded 0.5% ofthetime. Forthis case, we calculate thehorizontal projection distance ofthepath tobe9.9km. The point rain rate exceeded inregion D3for0.5_ ofthetime is7.8mm/hr. The attenuation values exceeded forthis time arepredicted at2.9dBfor12GHz and4dBfor14GHz. Thecomposite C/Nforthecircuit canbeless than 9dB for1%ofthetime orless. Using anequal allocation philosophy, the carrier-to-noise ratio notexceeded oneither linkfor0.5% ofthetime should be12dB. With thecurrent initial parameter values, thedownlink clear air C/Nis13.7 dB.

Rather than attempting toagain increase thesatellite EIRP, we shall exercise ouroption for5-meter ground station antennas, which provides 4.4dBmore gain.

Theoutage time percentage ofinterest inthis case is 0.15% foreach link. Theattenuation exceedance curves given bythe computation ofFigure6.3-1 areshown inFigure 7.3-3.Onthedownlink, the attenuation exceeded for0.15% ofthetime is17.2 dB. From Figure 6.5-3, we seethat upto12dBofdiversitygain maybeobtained atlarge separations. Here, wewill assume that 10dBcanbeachieved, sotheattenuation exceeded iseffectively 7.2dB.Accompanying 7.2dBofattenuation, there is(by Section 6.8.4)askynoiseincrease of220K. Thenoise temperature ofthe ground station (200K inclear air) increases bythis amount, so\"thedownlink C/Nisreduced byatotal of10.4 dB. Recall that thecomposite C/Nwas allowed tobe10dBworse than thenominalvalue for0.3% ofthetime. Thus, provided wecanlimit theuplink degradation toless than 10dBforatleast 0.15% ofthetime, thedownlink isnearlysufficient asis. Weshall increase thesatellitetransmitted power by2dBto-6dBWtoguarantee itsadequacy. Wecannowdeterminehowmany 120channel trunks mayshare the satellite repeater passband. Given that FDMA requires that thepower amplifier be\"backed off\" from saturationforintermodulation noisereduction, andthat solidstatetransmitter .technology islimited toafewwatts, wemay decidethat about 8trunk-paths shouldbeestablished pertransponder channel. Followingestablished practice forlower frequencies, these transponder channels will be35or40MHzwide. Forthe30GHzuplink,Figure7.3-3 showsthat theattenuation value exceeded 0.15% ofthetime is38.2 dB. Recall that under clear air conditions, a2dBWground terminal'transmitter yielded C/N=87..I dBonthe uplink.

This would require a diversity gain ofatleast 10.2 dB.Alternately, wemayspecify adiversity advantage (see Section 6.5.2). Figure 7.3-3 indicates that anattenuation of 28dBisexceeded forabout 0.3% ofthetime onthe30GHzlink. Therequired diversity advantage istherefore 2,which most available data (Engelbrecht-lgTg andHogg andChu-1975) indicates iseasily obtained. With some foresight, wewill stipulate that 13dBofdiversity gain isrequiredfor theuplink (orthediversity advantage must be2.3). 7.3.6.2 Apply Depolarization Analysis. Thetransmission oftwoorthogonally polarized signals from onesatellite isemployed todouble thespectrum utilization byfrequency reuse. Notevery system, ofcourse, will need to employ this technique, inview oftheadditional complexity andtheadded potential contribution topropagation caused outages. Theterm \"depolarization\" iscommonly employed todesignate the reduction incross-polarization discrimination seen atthereceiving location undersomepropagation conditions. When this occurs, each ofthetworeceived channels (polarizations) contains aninterference signalfrom theother polarization. Therefore, this signal issimilartointerference which may occur from other satellites, terrestrial systems,orother beams ofthesame satellite. Depolarization iscaused byrain, aswell asbyicelayers, inthe troposphere. Therain cancause strong depolarization events, inwhich the cross-polarization discrimination drops to20or15dB.

InFigure7.3-4, weshow ahypothetical version of such ajoint outage plot. Theparameter onthecurves represents the threshold value ofdepolarization above* which thegiven system isinoperable, i.e., anoutage exists. Itcanbeseen that there maybemany combinations of attenuation anddepolarization that will result inanygiven probability of outage. Typically, thethreshold depolarization isnotanindependent variable, butisfixed bythemodulation parameters. Then, itcanbe immediately determinedwhether thepreviously computed rain margin is sufficient forthedesired syst_ availability. Inmost cases, suchjoint statistics arenotavailable. Section 6.7 presents methods forprediction ofdepolarization statistics, including functional relationships between attenuation anddepolarization statistics. Using these prediction methods, itispossible toapproximate curves like those inFigure 7.3-4, though theexact shape ofeach curve will notbe mathematically precise. Forexample, thecurve for\"percent oftime attenuation ordepolarization exceeded\" forthedepolarization parameter equal to-10dBisessentially thesameastheattenuation versus percent exceeded curve alone (since depolarization iseffectively \"never\" solarge). For intermediate values ofthedepolarization parameter suchas-25dB,the appropriate curve ishorizontally asymptotic tothepercentage oftime that depolarization alone exceeds thepercentage. Each such horizontal asymptote then smoothlycurves into theattenuation onlycurve.

Theprocedure outlined !ii;iiii;il Incontrast tothe\"outage\" values ofdepolarization, thesmaller but more frequent values ofdepolarization canbeaccommodated inthesystem power margins. Inalmost allsatellitecommunications systems,thethermal noise is thedominant portion ofthetotal noise andinterference. Small cross-polarized components maytherefore betreated like anyother interference, Castel andBostian (1979) point outthat depolarization on digital systems canberegarded asanequivalent C/Ndegradation. The equivalent degradation Dduetodepolarization foran-ary PSKsystem is bounded by D(dB) <-20 log[1-(log-lxlZO)Isin(_/n)] where xisminus thecross polarization discrimination (XPD), indecibels. Theeffect ofcrosspolarization (and interference ingeneral) ondigital systems isconsidered more precisely byRosenbaum(lg70) andRosenbaum and Glare (1974). Thedetermination oflink availability considering the equivalent degradationincombination with rain attenuation isdiscussed by Wallace (1981). Similar procedures apply inanalog systems. Inpractice, the equivalent noise powers from allthermal noise andinterference sources, including intermodulation anddepolarization, areadded together, inpWOp for example, toproduce atotal link noise power which must meet theappropriate performance criterion (e.g., 10,000 pWOp). This adjustment to_hesystem noise budget results inafurthermodification tothepreviously calculated system parameters. Forexample, theINTELSAT Vsystem hasbeen designed to meet a10,000 pWOp criterion .(Gray andBrown-lg7g). Thecomposite received downlink must meet 7500 pWOp, with theremaining 2500 allocated toterrestrial 388,..:.-. !_i/!__/.'i _.... P Qandintersystem interference.

Thesephenomena have significanteffect onlyinunusualsystemdesigns, because theamount ofattenuation isgenerally much less than that ofrain.

Inaddition, clouds andfogare notlikely tooccursooftenastoinfluence thenominal performance value (50 or00_ofthetime).

This method, termed theComposite Margin Plane (CMP) analysis, permits aprecise calculation oflinkavailability (or alternately, outage time percentage) given therain attenuation statistics for theuplink anddownlink andthesystem performance parameters. TheCMP analysis isbased ontheequation forcomposite carrier-to-noise ratio given earlier, buttakes theuplinkanddownlink rain attenuations asthe independent variables.

Bantin andLyons (1978) studied theeffects ofrain, scintillation, ground terminal antenna pointing error, andsatellitestation-keeping onsystem availability statistics. Because they require complex computer evaluation, thetechniques describedinthese papers arenoteasily applied. Also, their useislimited tooneortwomultiple access configurations. McGregor (1981) presents amethod offinding system availability that isgeneral inits approach anddoes notrequire computer evaluation. Themethod allows oneto find thepdfofthecomposite carrier-to-noise ratio forasatellite circuit, considering thecharacteristics ofthemultiple access configuration, the propagation effects statistics, andthestatistical characteristics ofthe bodyofusersaccessing thesatellite.Inthereferenced report, themethod isapplied totheavailability analysis ofacode-division (spread-spectrum) multiple access system. 7.4REFERENCES 4 4Arnold,H.W.,D.C.Cox,H.H.Hoffman,andR.P.Leck(lg7g),\"Characteristics ofRain andIceDepolarization fora19and28GHzPropagation Path from aCOMSTAR Beacon,\" Record, Int'l Conf. onComm.

As of mid-1974, this new industry has evolved to the point where it serves a major portion of the world's population. The most dramatic illustration of this service is real-time television coverage of major inter­ national events, allowing Ifiillions to literally be \"on-the-spot\" to view such activities as the Olympic games and official state visits of world political and religious leaders. Numerous programs have contributed toward the evolution of satellite communications over the past 15 years and much has been written about them. The primary objectives of this compendium are to summarize the.major con­ tributions of each program and to compile an extensive bibliography of the publicly available writings on them. The compendium, first issued in 1971, sponsored by Communications Programs, Office of Applications, was assembled by the -Computer Sciences Corporation (Contract NAS 5-2f522) under the direc­ tion of the Communications and Navigation Division, Goddard Space Flight Cen­ ter, National"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__1", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 1, "text": "compile an extensive bibliography of the publicly available writings on them.

The compendium was reproduced in 1973 as NASA Report X-751-73-178, without updating. However, it incorporated some editorial changes in Section 10 suggested by the Communi­ cations Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), on behalf of Intelsat (International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium). This edition of the NASA Compendium of Satellite Communications Pro­ grams contains updated Sections 9 through 18, plus two new sections: Sec­ tion 19 -Communications Technology Satellite and Section 20 -U.S. Domestic Communications Satellite Systems.

Particular emphasis is placed on program results, including experiments conducted, communications system operational performance, and technology employed. The background for understanding these results is established through brief summaries of the program organization, system configuration, and satellite and ground terminal characteristics. Major consideration is given to the communications system aspects of each program, but general spacecraft technology and other experiments conducted as part of the same program are, for the most part, at least mentioned summarily. Each program review attempts to be thorough and objective to the maximum extent possible from publicly available literature. In some cases, such literature was not adequate to allow complete reporting to the level of descriptive detail desired. This is particularly true for programs involving foreign, international, or military sponsorship. Program difficulties encountered are viewed as positive contributions towards advancing the state-of-the-art in satellite communications and are presented in that light. The project reviews presented include all significant past programs in which satellites having some operational capability were successfully launched into orbit and all active programs, as of mid-1974, wherein development and procurement of the necessary space hardware had been approved. Soite of the programs described span a considerable period of time and present an evolutionary development of several con­ figurations of ground and space assets. In most such cases, separate discussions of the different segments of the program, each segment of which may encompass several spacecraft, are provided. The approach to program segmentation has, in all cases, been guided by the results-oriented objective of this document. The organizational grouping this provides may not in all cases coincide exactly with the chronological 1-1 sequence of events or the official program organization based on administrative con­ siderations and initially expected results.

The organizational grouping this provides may not in all cases coincide exactly with the chronological 1-1 sequence of events or the official program organization based on administrative con­ siderations and initially expected results. The document is organized and formatted to provide the user with easy access to needed information. It features a chronological ordering of program descriptions, brief concise summaries of each program, including extensive use of tabular presen­ tations, adherence to a consistent format from description to description, and exten­ sive bibliographies of cited and related references from which the reader can do more detailed research on a particular aspect of a program. The consistent format provides consideration of the same items of information in the same order on each program and extends this philosophy from the defining and ordering of major subtopics to the de­ fining and ordering of the tables employed. The bibliographies are incorporated directly following the particular program to which they are pertinent and are composed, in general, of references readily available within the public domain. The basic format for each description encompasses the following major sub­ topics: (1) Program Description, (2) System Description, (3) Spacecraft, (4) Ground Terminals, (5) Experiments, and (6) Operational Results. In a few instances, the nature and extent of available information dictated that the \"Program\" and \"System Description\" subtopics be replaced by a \"General Description\" or \"IAtroduction\" subtopic. In such cases, information of the type normally included in the first two subtopics is distributed over the introductory, spacecraft, and ground terminal sub­ topics. Information, \"typically, included within each major subtopic is as follows: * Program Description -Project origin and objectives; spacecraft launch dates, orbital data, and status; extent to which program objectives were accomplished;"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__23", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 23, "text": "type normally included in the first two subtopics is distributed over the introductory, spacecraft, and ground terminal sub­ topics. Information, \"typically, included within each major subtopic is as follows: * Program Description -Project origin and objectives; spacecraft launch dates, orbital data, and status; extent to which program objectives were accomplished; participating ground terminals; sponsoring organizations; and significant results advancing the state-of-the-art in satellite communi­ ,cations. 1-2 * System Description -Ground terminal linking, extent of spacecraft visi­ bilities, operating frequencies, signal processing including. modulation and multiple access, system control, and calculated link performance. * Spacecraft -Major characteristics of antennas and communications re­ peaters; general satellite features including stabilization, prime power, size and weight; and communications repeater block diagram. Major on­ board experiments not directly communications -related are listed but-not described in detail. * Ground Terminals -Major characteristics of antennas, receive system, transmitter, tracking system and physical installation; block diagram of principal subsystems; and any unique aspects. * Experiments -Definition of major types of experiments, summary of pri­ mary experimental results, and descriptions of significant demonstrations and public relations highlights. * Operational Results -Summary of operational traffic handled, plus opera­ tional performance and reliability of the satellites and ground terminals. 1.2 OVERVIEW OF PROGRAMS Major events, in each of the programs reviewed in this document, are summa9 rized as a function of time in Figure 1-1. The programs illustrated encompass all significant satellite communication activities involving orbiting hardware since the launching of the Score satellite, with the possible exception of Project Oscar.

Historical Summary of Program Activities as of Mid-1974 The figure dramatically displays the very short duration of the Score and Courier programs conducted during the early history of satellite comniunibations. These pro­ grams represented the initial attempts'to employ active satellites for communications. During this early era, the Echo and West Ford programs also displayed the long life times attainable through employing passive satellites to establish a communications system. However, the Telstar, Relay, and Syncom programs soon proved that highly reliable active satellites were feasible and, in view of the higher system capacities provided, all subsequent programs have followed their lead. Some modest interest in passive satellite technology has been retained by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) but no technology developments or future satellite launchings are presently planned. The technology demonstrated in the Telstar, Relay and Syncom programs led, in a relatively short time, to the development of operational systems. Subsequent programs providing these systems have included Intelsat, Initial Defense Communi­ cations Satellite Program (IDCSP), Skynet, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) program, the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Phase.

One satellite active, numerous planned. developing strategic and tactical military communication systems. The evolution of the strategic systems began with the Score and Courier, experimental store-and­ forward satellites. It was continued almost 6 years later with the first IDCSP launch­ ing. In the interim period, the military attempted to develop three axis-stabilized satellites for launch into synchronous orbits i. e., Project Advent), developed the system concepts, and designed the space segment for a medium altitude random polar orbit system, and extensively considered the possibility of employing Intelsat for ser­ vice. Project Advent was terminated in 1962 when the launch vehicle and stabilization technology required proved to be beyond the state-of-the-art at that time. The medium altitude development was suspended when the potential economies of Intelsat service emerged. The latter was dropped for a number of reasons with the principal factor being the military requirement for a high degree of independentsystem control. The IDCSP concept provided some of the desired system economies by reducing the number of previously planned medium altitude satellites in random near synchronous orbits, using independently programmed and funded Titan 0ICdevelopmental launches. Be­ tween the termination of Project Advent and the first IDCSP launching, the military gained operational satellite communications experience by supplying the ground com­ plex and conducting the communication experiments on NASA's Project Syncom.

Strategic military communications were advanced when the DSCS Phase I satellites became operational in early 1974. Further advances will be realized in the future when the planned DSCS Phase I satellites are introduced. Developing tactical systems did not become a formally announced goal of the U. S. military until 1965 when the Tacsatcom program was established. The experi­ mental UHF satellites of the LES program and the Tacsat satellite followed in direct response to that goal. However, some of the major system concepts, and in particu­ lar the modulation concepts evaluated in these experiments, began to evolve in the West Ford program and the SHr portion of the LES program. The latter two evalua­ tions also contributed data of general scientific interest and information applicable to the development of strategic military systems but in a larger sense they represented the beginning of tactical military system experimentation. 1-10 NASA has been responsible for the purely scientific programs conducted to date. These programs have investigated technology applicable in all types of satellite communications systems. NASA became active in satellite communications at a very early date through the Echo passive satellite program. As the general interest in active satellites intensified in the early 1960s, the Relay and Syncom programs came into being to investigate these types of satellites in medium and synchronous altitude orbits, respectively. Towards the mid-1960s the questions on the type of satellite and orbit to employ had been resolved and approaches to realizing high gain satellite antennas, spacecraft stabilization, and multiple access became the vital issues.

An Advanced Syncom program was initially conceived by NASA to study these problems. However, this soon evolved into the ATS program, which added a multitude of other space experiments to those designed to advance communications technology. The programs oriented toward realizing a system capable of supporting inter­ national commercial communications include Telstar and Intelsat. Telstar was an experimental program that contributed to general scientific knowledge. However, it was initiated by the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) Company primarily to demonstrate the feasibility of employing active satellites for commercial communi­ cations. Before the program was completed, AT&T was legislated out of international commercial satellite ownership by the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, creating the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat). This was followed in 1964 by international interim agreements establishing Intelsat and including Comsat as the U. S. representative in this consortium of international partners. The Intelsat program was initiated immediately based on technology developed in NASA's Project Syncom. Foreign programs producing systems whose primary objective has been military communications include Molniya, Skynet, and NATO. The experimental beginnings upon which the Russian Molniya program was based are not publicly known. These spacecraft began to be placed in orbit in the mid-1960s and an operational system was soon established to provide military and some civilian communications. This system has been maintained since that time through replacement launches of similar, if not 1-11 identical, spacecraft. The Molniya II satellite is being used in parallel with the U. S. 's Intelsat for the Hotline, a direct communication link between Washington and Moscow. The Skynet and NATO programs evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s from tech­ nology developed in the U.

S. military's IDCSP program. Skynet provided military communications for the United Kingdom (U. K.) and NATO did the same for the NATO countries. Neither system is presently operational, but followon systems are planned for both. Systems designed strictly to provide internal domestic communications for a particular country are still in their infancy. The first such system, Canada's Telesat program, became operational in 1973. Three U.S. systems were operational by the fal of 1974; additional U. S. systems and a European system are planned. Looking into the future, a number of potential new programs and continuations of old programs can be discerned. Plans exist for two additional highly classified LES experimental satellites, and it is expected that follow on U.S. military tactical satellite programs will evolve soon within each of the three services. The Communi­ cations Technology Satellite (CTS), sponsored jointly by Canada's Department of Com­ munications (DOC) and NASA, is expected to be launched late in 1975. CTS, being developed jointly by Canada and NASA with some involvement by ESRO, will be inte­ grated in Canada. The participants will conduct experiments on a time-shared basis. Intelsat has plans for Intelsat IVA and V, a series of spacecraft to advance their in­ ternational commercial system. The technology upon which the Intelsat V satellites will be based may be developed by a prototype or experimental satellite flown before the operational satellites are launched in the late 1970s.

S.R. has been granted allocations by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for a geostationary satellite system operating at C-Band. Additionally, experi­ mental Franco-German Symphonie and Italian Sirio programs are underway that will provide much of the basis for the intra-European system being developed by the European Space Research Organizaton (ESRO). Finally, a completely new use for 1-12 satellite communications technology has recently become apparent. This is in the area of air and marine traffic management. 1.3 EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY The low altitude Score satellite employed simple off-the-shelf VHF hardware to dramatize the potential of satellite communications by broadcasting a prerecorded Christmas message from President Eisenhower in 1958. From this beginning, the interest in satellite communications began to mount in the early 1960s. Major initial areas of concern centered upon the type of satellite to select, type of orbit to employ, frequencies to utilize, and the development of ground terminal technology compatible with satellite communications. The basic satellite question was whether active or passive satellites should be employed. Either store and forward or real time active satellite repeaters were feasible. Passive reflector systems could be composed of a relatively small number of large single point reflecting structures or belts of multiple dispersed reflective elements. To resolve the orbit selection issue, low, medium and synchronous altitudes had to be considered, as did orbit in­ clination and degree of ellipticity. Frequencies appropriate for consideration were determined to be in the band from 1 to 10 GHz.

To resolve the orbit selection issue, low, medium and synchronous altitudes had to be considered, as did orbit in­ clination and degree of ellipticity. Frequencies appropriate for consideration were determined to be in the band from 1 to 10 GHz. Ground terminal technology of parti­ cular interest included low noise receive systems, demodulator thresholds allowing detection down to low values of signal-to-noise ratio, accurate satellite tracking so that high gain antennas could be employed, and high reliability operational performance. Outside of these areas the programs of the early 1960s (including Echo, Courier, West Ford, Telstar, and Relay) employed similar technology that was well within the state-of-the-art at that time. Briefly, the active satellites provided almost omni­ directional antennas with essentially zero gain, low transmitter output power, no stabilization or spin stabilization relative to the sun, and solar cell arrays encircling the outside of the spacecraft to generate prime power. The ground terminals supplied large parabolic reflector or horn antennas, high power klystron or TWT transmitters, and fixed installations.' Modulation was conventional analog frequency modulation and multiple access was by frequency division when employed. The active satellites were, 1-13 in general, expected to support no more than two simultaneous accesses. Communi­ cation services handled included analog voice, TTY, low resolution facsimile, and television. By late 1963, with the aid of data from these initial programs, the questions of type of satellite, frequency band, and ground terminal technology had been resolved. Relay and Telstar had proven that reliable active real time repeaters were feasible and they had become the preferred choice. These repeaters were of the double conversion type with either hard limiting or AGC to ensure a constant input to the output power amplifier operating near saturation. Active repeaters were preferred over the passive systems of"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__36", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 36, "text": "reliable active real time repeaters were feasible and they had become the preferred choice. These repeaters were of the double conversion type with either hard limiting or AGC to ensure a constant input to the output power amplifier operating near saturation. Active repeaters were preferred over the passive systems of Echo or West Ford due to the higher system communication capacities afforded. Real time repeaters were the choice over the store and forward system of Courier because they resulted in simpler more reliable repeaters, and launch vehicle technology had progressed to the point that reasonably sized satellites could be in­ jected into orbits high enough to provide wide areas and relatively lengthy periods of mutual ground terminal visibility. Satellite communication frequencies had been reserved at 4 and 6 GHz for commercial operations and at 7 and 8 GHz for government operations. The former were the frequencies demonstrated in the Telstar program while the latter were employed on West Ford. Basic ground terminal technology had been developed on the Echo program in­ eluding: cooled maser and uncooled parametric amplifier low noise receive systems; FM feedback demodulators for threshold extension; and accurate tracking using pro­ grammed inputs, manual steering from optical settings or radar autotracking. This technology was upgraded on Project Telstar to display reliabilities compatible with commercial operations and precision autotracking of beacon or communications signals radiated from active satellites. By late 1963, cooled parametric amplifier low noise receive systems had also begun to appear in Projects Telstar and Relay. In 1963 and 1964, the orbit question was finally, for the most part, resolved by the results of the Syncom program, in favor of geostationary orbits.

This completed 1-14 the early experimental phase of satellite communications wherein the fundamental system concepts that have continued to apply were established. Syncom demonstrated launch vehicle and satellite positioning and stabilization technologies to precisely inject spacecraft into synchronous equatorial orbits, to position in longitude and to maintain a satellite's longitudinal position (i. e., station­ keep). It further gave a preliminary indication that the long propagation time delay (i. e., 260 ms round trip) and the associated echo problems that it introduces into 2-wire terrestrial telephone facilities were surmountable and, therefore, posed no drawbacks to this approach to satellite communications. With synchronous technology proven, the facts that only three or four satellites were required to provide a system giving world­ wide earth coverage between +750 of latitude, that earth terminal tracking requirements were significantly relaxed though not entirely eliminated, and that the problem of hand­ over from one moving satellite to another no longer existed, made geostationary orbits the preferred choice for point-to-point communication via satellite. Syncom further refined the state-of-the-art by providing advancements in satel­ lite stabilization techniques and antennas. Syncom was spin-stabilized, as were Telstar and Relay, but in this case the spin axis was aligned at a 90 ° angle to the orbital plane and precisely maintained in this orientation by H202 gas jets. This\" allowed antennas providing pancake-shaped beams only slightly wider than required to cover the earth from synchronous altitude (i. e., 170) to be employed. These antennas provided gains of about 6 dB.

With the feasibility of satellite communications demonstrated and the basic system concepts defined, interest turned in the mid-1960s to implementing operational systems, further refinements of spacecraft and ground terminal technologies, and developing advanced modulation and multiple-access techniques, including those designed specifically for handling digital communications traffic. In 1965 and into late 1966, the Intelsat and Molniya programs provided the beginnings of what was later to develop into extensive operational systems. During this same period, the X-Band portion of the LES program began to investigate-technology refinements and advanced techniques. 1-15 In early 1965, Intelsat I (Early Bird) was launched into a geostationary orbit with the spacecraft located over the Atlantic Ocean and after a short checkout period introduced the first continuous commercial communications services provided by satellite. Early Bird employed satellite technology developed in Project Syncom to provide communications between terminals that were, for the most part, upgraded and modified versions of installations developed during Projects Telstar and Relay. Early Bird provided a duplex high capacity trunk between the United States and Europe. Its main technological contribution was to demonstrate, finally and conclusively, through extensive subjective user evaluations, that time delay and echo are not serious problems in synchronous satellite communications. Shortly after the Early Bird launch, the first of the Molniya satellites, developed by the U.S. S. R., began to appear in orbit. These spacecraft employed orbits uniquely suited to provide service to regions lying entirely in the Earth's northern hemisphere. The orbits selected are highly elliptical, with 12-hour periods and apogees occurring over the northern hemisphere.

Major spacecraft technological innovations included flywheel stabilization, fully sun­ oriented solar panels, and antennas that tracked the earth independent of the main body of the satellite. The X-Band LES Satellites of this period investigated despun satellite antennas, automatic on-board spacecraft attitude control, fully solid state transponders opera­ ting at X-Band, and ground terminal digital equipment providing random multiple access. Antenna despinning was of interest as a means of obtaining high gain earth coverage pencil beams on spin-stabilized spacecraft. The X-Band LES satellites pro­ vided an initial indication of the feasibility of despinning by switching between elements of a multi-element array encircling the spacecraft spin axis. However, since these satellites were not at synchronous altitudes, the full gain potential of the technique was not demonstrated. Autonomous on-board attitude control to reduce ground control requirements was initially demonstrated on a satellite stabilized relative to the suit 1-16 Accurate on-board control of earth-oriented satellites remained to be proven. Solid­ state X-Band transponders were shown to befeasible, but their low efficiencids and power outputs made them relatively unAttf &activ as compared to the TWT output amplifiers being employed on operational sysems.

Error correcting\"sequential decoding of convolutionally encoded messages was also shown to be a powerful means for improving performance in digital systems operating at low signal-to-noise, ratios. By mid-1966, the initial'interests of the,mid-1960s in operational'systems and advanced techiology and technkiues were supplemented by'an interest in new applica­ tions. Up to this time, satellite commuunications 'had been looked upon, principally, as just another means of providing the kind of commumication services commonly available in the military and commercial long-haul telecommunications networks (i. e., analog voice, TTY, low resolution facsimile, and television). It now began to be apparent that powers and bandwidths were available to support wideband digital traffic such as might be produced by high resolution facsimile and computer-to­ computer applications. Additionally the-high satellite, EIRP made available by advanced TWTs and earth coverage pencil beams made it possible to provide communi­ cations and position location for small aircraft, shipborne, remote data platform; and mobile land terminals.

By late .1967, three Intelsat Is had been successfully 1-17 launched, and commercial communications service was being provided over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The advent of reliable tunnel diode amplifiers to serve as relatively low-noise, high-gain satellite input preamplifiers allowed single RF conversion transponders to be provided on these satellites. Allowable satellite weight and prime power in combination with new high performance earth terminals permitted these transponders to be designed for linear input/output power transfer characteris­ tics. These wideband satellites and an expanded ground complex resulted in extensive satellite multiple access in an operational system for the first time. Conventional FM-FDMA was employed, and system control techniques were developed to provide a high reliability operational system. Concurrent with these Intelsat activities, continued launches of the Molniya I spacecraft maintained an operational Russian system. With the addition of new ground terminals, service in this system was considerably expanded in 1967 when the U.S.S.R. inaugurated a space television distribution system, allowing people in Siberia, the Far East, and the Far North to view broadcasts from Moscow. In late 1966, the first group of 7 IDCSP satellites were successfully injected into near synchronous orbits, using a single launch vehicle, and by mid-1968 three more successful launches had established a system including more than 20 satellites. This military system began to meet emergency operational requirements in December, 1966, and by mid-1967 it was declared completely operational. In this system of multiple, near synchronous satellites, outage periods due to no spacecraft being visible and during satellite handovers were overcome by scheduling around these events.

The type of system realized was the result of economic considerations dictating that a space segment, initially designed and developed before synchronous technology was proven feasible, be implemented. The system employed conventional modulation and multiple­ access techniques, except for high data rate (1Mbps) MFSK modems for facsimile transmission and an operational pseudonoise antijam capability. Extensive evaluations of approaches to realizing high gain, pencil beam, earth coverage antennas were conducted during this period. Techniques for realizing despun 1-18 antennas on spin-stabilized spacecraft were exhaustively considered, and gravity gradient stabilization, such that rigidly mounted spacecraft antennas were continuously pointed towards the earth, was seriously investigated for the first time. Electronically despun phased arrays were flown on a synchronous ATS satellite in late 1966, and on a near synchronous test spacecraft launched as part of the IDCSP program in mid-1967. These tests demonstrated that this type of antenna system was feasible, and gains of up to 14 dB were realized. Electronic switching asia means to realize a despun antenna was given further consideration in the synchronous UHF LES satellite launched in late 1968. The feasibility of this approach was again demonstrated, and a.gain of about 10 dB realized. However, questions on the optimum approach to antenna despinning were laid to rest when an ATS spacecraft launched in late 1967 demonstrated the feasibility of mechanically despun antennas. By late 1968, it was apparent that the latter approach provided reliable performance and antenna gains of about 16 dB.

Gravity gradient stabilization was of interest because of the potentially high reliabilities available from such a passive system. Launches of medium and syn­ chronous altitude ATS spacecraft, designed for this type of stabilization, were attempted in early 1967 and late 1968, respectively. Additionally, special hear synchronous test satellites, included as part of the IDCSP program, were launched in mid-1966 and mid-1967. The ATS evaluations could not be conducted due to launch vehicle failures. The IDCSP tests demonstrated a limited degree of success in initially establishing and maintaining gravity gradient stabilization, but numerous unexplained difficulties were encountered. As a result, by late 1968, the jury was still out on gravity gradient stabilization, but the initial findings were not favorable. The mid-1966 to late 1968 time period also saw considerable experimentation, at VHF and the lower UHF frequencies, with providing communications to small mobile or remote terminals or both.. The existence of extensive conventional small terminal facilities was the primary driving force behind the initial interest in this frequency 1-19 band. A preliminary evaluation of propagation characteristics had been carried out with the aid of a simple UHF beacon radiating satellite launched as part of the LES program in late 1965. Additionally, a few simple demonstrations had been conducted, using the telemetry and command system on a Syncom satellite. More extensive experiments were made possible with the inclusion of a VHF transponder on the first spin-stabilized ATS spacecraft launched in late 1966.

The emphasis in the LES experiments was on developing a tactical military capability, while the interest in ATS was in demonstrating position location and communications for application to commercial and private aircraft and ships and to remote data platforms. The experiments performed considerably advanced the state of knowledge of propagation and noise at these frequencies while proving that such systems were feasible. In the LES program, the first experimental tactical terminals designed for specific military applications began to emerge. During this period, the spin-stabilized ATS satellites also demonstrated the feasibility of a signal-processing satellite repeater that provided multiple access through frequency-division multiplexing of independent single sideband uplink signals and down-converting the composite received signal for phase modulation of a single radiated carrier. This system was of interest because it supplied frequency spectrum conservation on the uplink and efficient utilization of available spacecraft power on the downlink. Additionally, a UHF LES satellite demonstrated that an autonomous control ,system could accurately maintain a spin-stabilized spacecraft's spin axis at a 90' orientation relative to the orbital plane. Between late 1968 and early 1971, the areas of concern that existed in the years spanning the mid and late 1960s had to be further expanded to include consideration of higher frequencies for providing the same types of services.

In late 1968, Intelsat began to' establish a third generation satellite system. By early 1970, five successful launches had been bompleted, and a truly worldwide system providing service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans had been completed. b These satellites took advantage of the technology- developed in the ATS program by employing mechanically despun antennas. The transponderswere again linear, single conversion repeaters and FM-FDMA was the main mode of operation.

A Skynet satellite was placed into a g6ostationary orbit providingvisibility from Europe and much of Africa, in late 1969, and an operational military ssrstem for the United Kingdom was established. The satellite was based on technology developed in the IDCSP program but pseudonoise PSK was used to.provide multiple access in the first all-digital operational system. NATO satellites Were.launched-into geostationary orbits in early 1970 and early 1971. They were positioned over the Atlantic to provide operational service for-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cpuntries and employed conventional technology developed in the IDCSP and Skynet programs. 1-21 On the LES program, testing of the UHF satellite launched in late 1968 con­ tinued. In addition to displaying the switched antenna, this satellite demonstrated the feasibility of high-efficiency, solid-state UHF transmitters operating directly from the unregulated primary power source, autonomous satellite stationkeeping and station­ changing, and reliable pulsed plasma microthrusters, The demonstrated autonomous stationkeeping capability, together with the previously displayed autonomous attitude control system, provided the potential for significantly reducing future ground tracking and command requirements. The spacecraft microthrusters were of interest as a means towards attaining highly precise attitude control and stationkeeping systems. Microthrusters were first considered in the ATS program as a means of providing stationkeeping and stationchanging on gravity gradient stabilized satellites where the attitude correction torques were quite low.

Tacsat included both UHF and SHF transponders, an input/output switching capability. and an ability to vary transponder bandwidth that afforded multiple commandable modes of operation, including cross­ band configurations. By early 1971, prototype operational tactical terminals, at both UHF and SHF, had been demonstrated for aircraft, ship or land mobile use. In addi­ tion, operational frequency-hopping MFSK modems had been displayed. This approach was selected over pseudonoise PSK due to shorter acquisition times in a random-access environment, relaxed synchronization reqlirements, and a grdater resistance to the multipath likely to occur in many tactical situations (e. g., as for aircraft communi­ cation at elevation angles below 200). In late 1969, the final ATS spacecraft designed for gravity gradient stabilization was launched. The launch vehicle performed properly but control of the satellite was lost during an initial spin stabilized period before location on-station in a geostationary orbit. As a result, the spacecraft was left spinning about a longitudinal axis such that it could not be despun and the gravity gradient booms deployed. By early 1971, this final failure to demonstrate reliable gravity gradient stabilization at synchronous 1-22. altitude, along with the successful development of despun antennas, had caused interest in this technique to wane. In spite of the improper stabilization, L-Band and milli­ meter wave experiments included on this satellite were vperformed, and valuable data was obtained that will contribute towards opening these frequencies for future use.

The millimeter wave frequencies evaluated were at 15.3 and 31. 65 GHz. Finally, in early 1971, Intelsat successfully launched the first of a fourth genera­ tion Intelsat space system. This satellite features earth coverage and fixed narrow coverage antennas on a mechanically despun platform. Additionally, it provides 12 transponders of moderate bandwidth such that separate types of services can be pro­ vided in separate channels (e. g., television distribution in one channel, high capacity telephone trunks in another, and low duty cycle individual voice links in still another). Through the introduction of new technology in RF filters, TWTs, and antennas the Intelsat IVA will be able to provide 20 transponders by reusing frequency spectrum in different areas of the coverage zone. Thus, higher capacity will be accomplished without the extension of technology required to develop the Intelsat V satellite. In 1973, Telesat became operational, providing Canada with a commercial do­ mestic satellite communications system capable of providing communications to small, simple unattended terminals in far northern and arctic .remote locations. In addition to serving Canada's long haul and remote-location communications needs, Telesat is also providing the satellike link for the initial RCA Globcom U. S. domestic communi­ cations satellite system. Both strategic and tactical military communications progressed with the intro­ duction of operational DSCS Phase I satellites in March 1974. In addition to providing multiple high capacity links between strategic earth terminals with large antennas and high-powered transmitters, these satellites provide similar communication capabilities between mobile or transportable tactical earth terminals with small antennas and low­ powered transmitters.

These highly flexible, high capacity, multiple access capabilities are made possible 1-23 by cross-strapping two high gain-narrow coverage antennas and a single earth­ coverage antenna on the DSCS Phase II satellite. The planned DSCS Phase III satellites can be expected to advance military communications even further. The latest in the Applications Technology Satellite series, ATS-6, was launched May 30, 1974 and is potentially the most significant step in advancing the technology of satellite communications. A most impressive feature of the ATS-6 satellite is a 9.1-meter (30-foot) diameter parabolic antenna. The ATS-6 also exhibits highly accu­ rate 3-axis stabilization using gas jets and error signals derived from a monopulse receive tracking system, and input/output switching among multiple transponders re­ ceiving and transmitting in different frequency bands. To test the feasibility of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS), the ATS-6 will investigate techniques of employing a synchronous communications satellite as a relay for tracking other sat­ ellites and transferring digital signals between them and a ground station. Other experiments will be concerned with techniques for aircraft position location, air-to­ ground communications using a synchronous satellite, educational TV, and for supply­ ing FM TV reception to small UHF ground terminals with the benefit of the 9.1-meter (30-foot) satellite antenna.

High power RF transmitters at frequencies about 10 GHz and prime power sources of kilowatt size or greater represent technology that will be needed for educational and community TV satellite broadcast systems, interplanetary space probes, and large earth-orbiting platforms. In addition to the advanced technology experiments, CTS will provide the vehicle for investigating numerous user applica­ tions. These may include educational TV, biomedical networks, law enforcement networks, and service for the handicapped applications. 1-24 The U. S. Domsat program provides the potential for supplying point-to-point trunk and multipoint message telephone; telegraphic and wideband data; and network, educational, and community antenna television services that complement and improve the services presently provided by terrestrial facilities.

All ground stations were linked by both telephone and HF radio to the system control center at the Signal Corps Laboratory in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The design of the system was based on providing two modes of operation -as a delayed repeater and as a real time active repeater. In the delayed repeater mode, the satellite would record information transmitted to it upon reception of a suitable command signal from a ground station.. Upon reception of a different command signal, the satellite would transmit the previously stored information back to the originating ground station. The second mode of operation, that of a real time repeater, was obtained by the use of yet another command signal which activated the satellite as a radio relay repeater station with the recording mechanism bypassed. The capacity of the system was one voice channel or seven 60-wpm teletype channels, frequency division multiplexed. 2-2 The satellite receiver was an FM \"pagingt\" receiver -the 4p,- often used by doctors and salesmen to receive telephone calls when away from their offices. A commercial transistor model was .modified extensively through the addition of an RF stage using selected transistors to increase its sensitivity. A vacuum tube transmitter from an FM handle-talkie was repackaged and modified through the ad­ dition of a high power (8 watts) output stage. A continuous loop magnetic tape re­ corder developed at the Signal Corps Laboratory was used as the message storing device. 23 meters (75 feet) of magnetic tape was used to provide 4 minutes of audio recording.

Since the satellite was expected to orbit for only 20 days, a non-rechargeable high capacity zinc-silver oxide battery was employefd rather than heavier and more costly solar and nickle cadmium cells. The Atlas missile itself was used as the antenna and was excited by slots located in the two pod covers. The resulting radiation pattern was similar to a long wire doublet with associated nulls.

For monitoring the satellite's tracking beacons, receiving equipment was provided which enabled reception of the tracking frequency near 108 MHz. In all but the California station, the ground antenna was positioned by an operator maximizing the 108-MHz signal reception with the antenna positioning controls. At the California station, the azimuth control was slaved to the alidade of an experimental direction-finding equipment while the elevation control was manually varied. The communication characteristics of the ground stations are tabulated in Table 2-5. 2.5 EXPERIMENTS On the first orbit, attempts were made by the California ground station to interrogate the comfinunication package designated No. 1.

Since no other orbit that day was close enough to the ground station, no further attempts were made to interrogate the communication equipment. On the following day, package No. 2 was interrogated by a temporary site established at Cape Canaveral (now Cape Kennedy) for prelaunch checkout. It responded and the ground crew received the following prerecorded message from President Eisenhower: This is the President of the United States speaking. Through the marvel of scientific advance, my voice is coming to you from a satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one. Through this unique means, I convey to you and to allmankind America's wish for peace on earth and good will towards men everywhere. On each of the subsequent days, each function for which the equipment was designed was tested and successfully demonstrated. Among the experiments per­ formed were the following: 1. Initially, transmission of President Eisenhower's prerecorded voice message followed by one channel of teletype code. 2. Direct relay of California's communication site identification in voice, followed by the President's message in teletype code. The Texas site received these signals with two short fades and the Arizona and Georgia sites received portions of the transmission. 3. While clearing the tape recorder, California transmitted in voice to the satellite for storage. Texas interrogated the satellite, and both Texas and Georgia received the voice loud and clear.

The satellite was then interrogated and good teletypewriter copy was received. 2-8 In summary, the communications package was interrogated 78 times, loaded with new material 28 times, and operated as a real time relay for a total of 117 deliberate operations. Until battery-exhaustion on December 30, 1958, the satellite demonstrated conclusively the practical operation of a satellite radio relay system capable of spanning intercontinental distances. 2.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Since Project SCORE was an experimental program, no operational traffic was passed. Further, the operational reliabilities of the satellite and ground terminals were generally good and in agreement with prelaunch expectations. This performance reflected the exclusive usage of state-of-the-art hardware that characterized this system's implementation. 2-9 RELATED REFERENCES 1. S. P. Brown and G. F.

The IGY balloon satellite had been conceived and designed primarily for air density experiments. NASA took charge of this activity and reformulated it as Project Echo in late 1958. as indicated in Table 3-1. (1)(2)'Major objectives for the Echo program were Table 3-1. Echo Program Objectives Number Description 1 To evaluate the communications capability available from large spherical passive satellite reflectors. 2 To study the feasibility of erecting and maintaining large lightweight structures in the space environ­ ment. 3 To gather data on solar pressure and the outer limits of the earth's atmosphere as well as evaluating their effects on satellite orbits. Of three attempts to orbit passive reflecting balloons during this program, two of these efforts were successful. The launches and satellite status are reviewed in (1)(3)(4)Table 3-2. Prior to the initial Echo launch, extensive ground, vacuum chamber, and space ballistic tests were conducted.

The balloon deployment system 'was refined and space-qualified during four launches into a ballistic trajectory by modified Sargent rockets from NASA's Wallops Island, Virginia, launch site. These launches were code-named Shotput I through IV. The first launch on 28 October 1959 3-1 resulted in the sphere rupturing into a thousand pieces. After two more tests on 16 January 1960 and 27 February 1960 and changing the folding pattern, inflation system, and prelaunch payload conditioning cycle, a successful vertical test was conducted on 4 January 1960.

These beacons were left off the payload during the initial orbital launch attempt, since they had not been previously qualified by a vertical test. Following these activities, Echo I was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida, into a near circular low altitude inclined orbit. It was an immediate resounding success, being large and reflective enough to be seen against the nighttime sky with the naked eye. During its lifetime, valuable information was contributed towards meeting all the program objectives listed in Table 3-1. In particular, the feasibility of passive satellite communications was demonstrated. 3-2 The one drawback of the Echo I balloon was that it was not rigid enough to remain smooth and spherical under the deforming forces of atmospheric drag and solar pressure after its pressurizing gas leaked out. (1)(2)(6) Its shape deteriorated signi­ ficantly within a few week.s after launch. In recognition of this, efforts were inititated in late 1960 to develop a second generation Echo balloon that was rigid enough to withstand the deforming forces. Once again, static ground tests, vacuum chamber drop tests, and vertical space tests were conducted. The first two groups of tests were again conducted in the dirigible hanger at Weeksville, North Carolina, and at Langley Research Center, respectively. The two vertical launch tests occurred 15 January 1962 and 18 July 1962, employing a Thor rocket from Cape Kennedy.

TV and movie cameras mounted in the Thor followed and photographed the payload from ejection through reentry. In the first test, the balloon blew up due to excessive inflation pressure. During the second test, a different balloon inflatant resulted in successful balloon deployment, but pressurization was not great enough to provide a good reflecting surface. As a result of the suborbital tests, it was concluded that a thorough evaluation of inflation characteristics was necessary by means of full-scale balloon statics ground tests. These were conducted in the dirigible hanger at the Naval Air Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey. Following further refinement of the pressurization system during these tests, Echo II was successfully launched from the Western Test Range (i.e., Vandenberg Air Force Base, California) into a near polar low altitude orbit. Immediately after the first pass, it was determined that internal pressurization reached no more than 6. 895 X 106 newton/meter 2 (1000 psi) as compared to the 34.47 x 106 -41.37 X 106 newton/meter 2 (5000-6000 psi) expected, and the balloon was rotating about an inertial axis with a spin period of about 100 seconds. (7 ) These occurrences pro­ duced forces within the satellite shell that caused the surface to wrinkle somewhat. As a result, unexpectedly high scintillations of the reflected RF signals were encountered. In spite of this, the balloon remained an effective passive communications reflector and demonstrated that a lightweight spherical balloon could maintain its shape and surface 3-3 characteristics, even after the loss of inflatant pressure.

Valuable information was contributed towards meeting all the program objectives listed in Table 3-1. Numerous terminals from various countries conducted communications operations with the Echo satellites in response to an open invitation by NASA for worldwide utiliza­ tion. Some of the major participating terminals are listed in Table 3-3. (See references 1, 5, and 8 through 12.) Additionally, innumerable terminals distributed over the entire world, at one time or another, conducted radar or optical tracking operations with these satellites. NASA's minitrack network supplied the data from which Goddard Space Flight Center derived orbital tracking information for all interested parties. Satellite launchings were provided by NASA. The Echo program, which through Echo I provided the first extended satellite communications experiment, made a host of significant contributions to satellite communications technology. First, in reaching its major objective, it demonstrated the feasibility of using passive satellite reflectors for communication purposes and verified the theoretical limitations of such a system. Additionally, it verified the conventional theories for determining path loss on satellite links. Further, it fostered the development of much of the ground terminal technology that continues to be employed. Specific ground terminal items first demonstrated in the Echo project included a large-scale horn reflector antenna at Holmdel, low-noise receiver preamplifiers using solid state masers, frequency modulation feedback receivers, and satellite tracking of sufficient accuracy to allow real-time operational communica­ tions. Satellite tracking by radar, telescope, and computer predictions all proved to be quite reliable. Radar tracking operations included successful autotracking. 3.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system configuration for the major participants involved in the evaluation of communications via Echo I is depicted in Figure 3-1.

For the Echo II communication experiments, the system configuration for the principal participants was as illustrated in Figure 3-2. (10) The configuration was such as to provide half duplex communications as the primary mode of operation. Normally, Dallas transmitted while Stump Neck or Columbus or both received. Dallas could transmit on either of-two frequencies and Stump Neck could receive either of these frequencies. However, Columbus received on only one of the Dallas trans­ mit frequencies. The Dallas site included a second transmit antenna used in radar tracking operations to a receiver operating off the communications transmitting antenna. Radar tracking was performed at a separate frequency from the communication frequencies, and Stump Neck included a receive capability at that frequency. Stump Neck also included a communications transmit capability for use in special cases. East Coast to West Coast mutual visibilities were increased over those for Echo I by the higher orbital inclination of Echo II.

Strictly speaking, fading, due to scattering from the wrinkled skin of these reflectors, did become more of a problem at the higher frequencies. Operating frequencies for the major participants involved in experiments with Echo I and H1 are summarized in Tables 3-4 and 3-5, (5)(10) respectively. The two GHz frequencies were chosen because they were available for allocation by the Federal Communications Commission and because they were the correct frequencies for future satellite and deep space communications activities. The 960-1Hz frequency was chosen because equipment on this frequency existed at Goldstone from an earlier program. 3-7 ECHO 2 'A'l ANTNNA 18 (60' ANEN 5(28') ANTENNA 18m(6') ANTENNA osu,9OLUMBUS OHIOARAPAHO STATION NRLSTUMPNECK MD.

Therefore, any of the commonly conceived multiple­ access techniques (e. g., time, frequency, and code-division multiple access) could have been employed. Frequency division was used because of its ready compatibility with common existing earth terminal technology. For a perfectly spherical reflector with a smooth skin, there are likewise no satellite-imposed restrictions on the RF modulation technique employed. However, for a deformed reflector with a wrinkled skin, both fading and limitations on the coherent bandwidth are imposed. Frequency modulation (FM) is normally effective in the face of fading as long as the coherent bandwidth of the channel isn't exceeded. Large margins are required for an opera­ tional system of this sort. Margins, for a perfectly reflecting sphere, must account for variations in range, atmospheric and ionospheric attenuation and noise, antenna tracking and polarization losses, and ground terminal performance. For an imperfect sphere such as Echo I, margins must be further increased to account for signal fading due to scattering off the balloon surface and changes in the instantaneous reflective cross sectional area. 3-9 Signal processing techniques were basically the same for Echo II as for Echo I. Performance was improved somewhat primarily due to an average reflective cross sectional area that was 3 dB larger, slightly shorter ranges to the satellite, and the fact that the balloon shape did not deteriorate as a function of time. Additionally, both frequency and space diversity were tried as means of combating coherent fading. Table 3-6.

I( 1 ) In this design, long cigar-shaped pieces are cut out of sheet material and joined together with \"butt\" seams. Where the \"gores\" come together at the two poles of the structure, a reinforcing \"pole cap\" was used. The sphere was designed to have a 30.5-meter (100-foot) diameter when inflated and weighed approximately 61.2 kilograms (135 pounds). (3) 3-10 Before launch, the satellite was evacuated and accordion-pleat folded for pack­ ing in the spherical launch container. The launch container, measuring 66 centi­ meters (26 inches) in diameter, was also evacuated to a rather low vacuum prior to launch. When the container was placed in orbit, it was explosively separated at its equator and the satellite was initially inflated by the small amount of residual air en­ trapped within its interior.

( 1 6) Inflation was completed and the shape of the inflated satellite was temporarily maintained by the small gas pressure created by sublimating solids (i.e., 9.1 kilograms (20 pounds) of anthraquinone and 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of benzoic acid) contained within the satellite. (2) These inflatants could produce a skin stress of about 1.03 X10 newton/meter 2 (150 psi) in Echo I and the pressurized life of the satellite was approximately 14 days. . Initial tracking of the satellite was greatly aided by two radio beacon transmitters attached to the sphere's external surface. Each of the two assemblies, located diametrically opposite on the equator of the satellite, include one transmitter, its associated antenna, a group of solar cells and one-half of the satellite's storage­ batteries. (16) Each of the continuous wave transmitters was designed to provide about 10. 5 milliwatts of power at a frequency of 107.94 MHz. Crystals were chosen to provide a frequency separation of 500 to 1000 Hz between the two transmitted signals. *The quarter-wave monopole antenna for each beacon transmitter was erected normal to the satellite surface. The radiation pattern provided was somewhat similar to that of a monopole antenna above an infinite plane. In Echo II, the basic type of gore construction developed in Echo I was re­ tained. (1) It was made up of 106 gores with each gore measuring 1.2 X65. 5 meters (4 x 215 feet).( 2 ) The gores were butt-jointed together, using 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) wide tapes made of the same material as the gores.

The gores terminated at the polar areas of the sphere where 137-centimeter (54-inch) diameter pole caps were attached, using a 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) overlapping joint. The material used was a 3-layer sandwich of. 00051-centimeter (. 00020-inch) sheets of aluminium on each side of a *00091-centimeter (. 00036-inch) mylar polyester film. The total skin thickness was 3-11 .00191 centimeter (. 00075 inch), which was only 50 percent greater than that of Echo I but it produced a rigidity about 100 times greater. This construction resulted in an inflated sphere measuring 41. 1 meters (135 feet) in diameter and weighing 250 kilograms (550 pounds). The structure was folded and packed inside a launch canister having an elliptical vertical cross section and a circular horizontal cross section as mounted for launch­ ing. (6) The canister had a 76-centimeter (30-inch) vertical diameter and a 112-centi­ meter (44-inch) horizontal diameter. The container, as well as the satellite, was evacuated to prevent excessively rapid inflation by expansion of residual air inside. The canister was separated in orbit in the same manner as for Echo I and residual air again provided the initial inflation. However, continued inflation and full pressurization were accomplished in a much more controlled manner. In this system, the inflatant, now pyrozole, was sealed in numerous small packets that were attached to the inside surface of the satellite. ( 1 ) The packet§ were sealed with an adhesive wax that melted just below the equilibrium temperature of the sphere in orbit.

The bags, therefore, were not opened to start sublimation and the buildup to higher pressurization until the sun's energy elevated the temperature of the satellite. This occurred long after initial inflation and the danger of rupture due to dynamic loads had passed. Initial pressurization was designed to be higher than for Echo I. The theory be­ hind the use of the three-layer laminated material and this higher pressurization was that the different moduli of elasticity of mylar and aluminum would result in the alumi­ num stretching in a nonelastic fashion while the mylar sheet was still within its elastic limit. ( 1) Thus, after the pressurization escaped, the mylar would tend to return to its original dimensions, placing the aluminum cemented to it under a compressive load. This results in a material that behaves like a prestressed beam and is quite rigid. Echo II also supported two radio telemetry beacons mounted diametrically oppo­ site one another at the sphere's equator. These beacons served as a tracking aid as well as a means of telemetering data on satellite temperature and pressure. The pres­ sure monitoring capability extended from a minimum of 10-mm to a maximum of ( 1 7 ) 0.5 mm of mercury. The temperature measurements extended from 3-12 1530 K (-1200 C) to 4330 K (1600 C). The beacon system included two battery packs, four solar cell panels, and interconnecting cables to give a total weight of approxima­ ,tely 3 kilograms (6 pounds). The carrier frequencies were at 136.020 and 136.170 MHz, and each carrier was amplitude-modulated with three sinusoidal subearriers bearing the telemetry information.

The effective radiated power of each transmitter was greater than 34 milliwatts under continuous operation. The beacons were designed to operate for 1 year, at which time a mercury cell cutoff circuit terminated radiations. 3.4 GROUND TERMINALS Characteristics of three of the terminals listed in Table 3-3 as participants in Project Echo. are provided in Table 3-7. (5)(10)(18)(19)(20) Holmdel and Goldstone were the two major experimenters involved in Echo I testing, while the Stump Neck terminal participated in Echo I tests and was a principal evaluator of communications via Echo II Major subsystems of the Holmdel and Stump Neck terminals are depicted in Figures 3-3(5) and 3-4(10 ) , respectively. The configuration of each of these three terminals reflects the considerable concern that existed over the feasibility of accurately acquiring and tracking the passive Echo spacecraft. None of the terminals relied on the satellite beacon for tracking. Beacon tracking was performed by the NASA Minitrack network, and the data contributed towards the generation of program track information by Goddard Space Flight Center. Radar techniques were employed by the communications terminals to give an active tracking capability. However, optical tracking was the preferrea method of tracking when the satellite, was visible (i. e., at night). Circular polarization was employed to eliminate the need for polarization tracking.

The second objective listed in Table 3-1 was accomplished through preflight statics tests, ballistic space tests, the TV system on the booster that monitored the deployment of Echo II, optical observations of both spheres over a period of time, and monitoring of reflected received signal levels over a period of time. Received signal level data was obtained in the planned, communi­ cations tests as well as in independent radar tracking operations. References 21 through 24 provide examples of the type of information analyses completed to verify that large lightweight structures of the Echo type can be successfully deployed and maintained in orbit. Accurate tracking of the Echo balloons was maintained throughout their lifetime. This gave the basis for accomplishing the third objective in Table 3-1, as well as allowing the'balloons to serve as accurate position location measurement references for remote geographic points.

Voice trans­ mission evaluations were extended by utilizing single-sideband, narrow-band phase, and amplitude-modulation techniques for comparison with frequency modulation. (5) The performance did,not equal that with FM, indicating that the coherent bandwidth of the channel had not been exceeded in the tests; therefore, conventional theories for comparing modulation techniques applied. Measured doppler shift was compared with theory and found to be in good agreement. Performance of FM with feedback receivers was evaluated and found to agree well with previous laboratory measurements and theory. Performance of the ground terminal tracking systems was closely watched. All performed well, and the potential of automatic tracking was demonstrated. In addition, a television signal was transmitted and limited quality reception obtained, using facilities developed for Project West Ford. (31) Numerous notable demonstrations were also conducted. (5)(30) Most of these occurred during the early days of Echo I and tended to dramatize the potential of this type of communications. Included were a tape-recorded voice message by President Eisenhower during the first satellite pass on August 12, 1960; prerecorded 2-way messages by President Eisenhower and Senator L. B. Johnson on August 13, 1960; and the first 2-way live voice transfer between Mr. W. C. Jakes of Bell Telephone Laboratories and Mr. P. Tardani of Jet Propulsion Labs also on August 13, 1960.

Finally, Echo I provided a first in international communications, when Russia agreed to participate in a cooperative experiment with NASA and to supply NASA with tracking data during the early orbits after launch. (11)(32)(33) The tests were con­ ducted in accordance with the Bilateral Space Agreement between the USSR (Academy of Sciences) and the USA (NASA) reached at Geneva on June 8, 19622 The tracking data consisted of photographs and optical observations that helped to determine that the balloon had been successfully deployed and to establish initial orbital parameters. 3-19 The communications experiments were performed between the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory of the-University of Manchester, England, operating on .NASA's behalf and the Zimenki'Observatory of the Gorki State University.northeast of Moscow. The Jodrell Bank facility provided a 76. 2-meter -(250-foot) diameter steerable antenna and a 1-kW transmitter to radiate signals at a frequency of 164.2 MHz. The Zimenki facility received both this signal and the 136-MHz satellite beacon, using a 14.9-meter (49-foot) diameter antenna. Transmissions included unmodulated carrier, 400-Hz tone modulation, Mbrse telegraphy, teletype, telephone and facsimile. Theoretical link calculations showed that performance could only be marginal, but the results obtained were even poorer than expected. This was attributed to inaccurate pointing of the antenna at the'transmitting site, refractive and reflective effects on the signal at the low elevation angles and wide beamwidths used, and polarization mismatches between the transmitting and receiving antennas. In spite of this, 34 experiments were conducted between 21 February and 8 March 1964, and the international cooperation displayed made the entire operation a significant diplomatic success. 3.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Project Echo was an experimental program; therefore no operational traffic was carried.

In spite of this, 34 experiments were conducted between 21 February and 8 March 1964, and the international cooperation displayed made the entire operation a significant diplomatic success. 3.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Project Echo was an experimental program; therefore no operational traffic was carried. Operation of the experimental ground stations was entirely satisfactory as expected. The only difficulty of any significance was caused by occasional errors in the prepass tracking predictions. These errors were of sufficient magnitude to make ground terminal program tracking unsatisfactory. They were a result of the manner in which the orbits of the large lightweight Echo structures were being perturbed from pass-to-pass by solar pressure and atmospheric drag. The tracking difficulties encountered could have been overcome by obtaining more extensive track­ ing data and updating computed orbital elements more often. No unexpected operational difficulties of importance were encountered with the Echo I balloon. At the end of a week of operation, a malfunction occurred in the 3-20 beacon battery supply such that the beacons transmitted only when a solar cell pack was illuminated by the sun. However, the beacons were not designed for a long lifetime, since their primary mission was toassist the, tracking operations during the early orbits of the satellite so that accurate initial orbital elements could be generated. This mission was fulfilled. The only anomalous operation that developed during operations with EchoII was scintillation of the reflected received signal due to wrinkling of the satellite skin. This was caused by the unexpected satellite spin that developed during the first orbit after launch and lower than expected initial inflation pressure. The exact cause of these unusual occurrences was not determined. The beacons on this spacecraft operated for 1 year as planned. 3-21 CITED REFERENCES 1. L.

S. Army Signal Research and Development Lab­ oratory (USASRL) submitted a technical proposal for a delayed repeater satellite communication system to the-Advanced Research and Development Agenc of the Defense Department. In October 1958, USASRL received approval to proceed with Project. Courier. The program was undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility and operational capabilities of a store-and-forward (information storage for future retrieval) satellite communications system with potential military application. (1) Two active delayed repeater, satellites, Courier Ia and Ib, were launched before this program was completed,- asindicated in Table 4-1. (2) After Courier Ia failed to reach orbit due to a missile malfunction, Courier Ib was successfully injected into a low altitude eliptic-al-oibit. Testing during the 1-7-day operational lifetime of Courier Ib fulfilled the program objectives. The operational usefulness of Courier Ib came to an end when it ceased to respond to attempts at \"turn on.\" Table 4-1.

However, the satellite's early failure clearly demonstrated the need for additional care and effort in designing and testing components and systems intended for operational satellite applications. 4.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Tests were conducted with Courier Ibon a loop-back or push-to-talk basis by the two terminals indicated in Table 4-2. Both real time and store-and-forward operation was possible. During store-and-forward operation, an earth terminal could load traffic into the spacecraft's tape recorders at the same time it received previously stored messages from the satellite. The altitude and inclination of the satellite orbit made an average of five workable orbits at the Fort Monmouth station and an average of seven at the Puerto Rico station possible out of approximately 14 orbits per day. (3) The satellite was in view of the ground station during each orbit for a maximum of 19 minutes at Fort Monmouth and 22 minutes at Puerto Rico.

During transmission over the downlink, the detected signal modulated the satellite transmitter's radiated carrier. .The uplink performance was, in general, superior to the downlink performance indicated in the table. Margins had to be adequate to account for variations in range, rain losses, satellite antenna gain as the aspect angle to the ground terminal changed, and other link parameters that varied to a smaller extent. 4-3 Table 4-4.

The design expectation was for a 1 year in orbit lifetime. A special acquisition transmitter, separate from the telemetry transmitter, was supplied. While in the acquistion mode, the two VHF receivers were alternately activated to \"listen\" for ground terminal signals, on a part-time basis.

(2) During the short operational lifetime of Courier Ib the satellite performance was (in general) good and in agreement with expectations. Spin rate was observed to decay at the rate of about 1 rpm per month. Performance exceptions involved the tape recorders and command system. One of the five tape recorders became stuck at an endstop and further recording or 4-9 playback was impossible. Command system malfunctions resulted in an operational effectivity of only about 95 to 97-percent; Malfunctions included failure to respond to commands, improper command acknowledgements, response to improper access codes, and in one case improper execution of the command sent. - Jamming resistance tests involved CW interference to theVHF link and both CWand pulse interference with the UHF message link. (2) Th6 system \"was found to be readily susceptible to jamming of either the UHF or VHF links, as might be expected since no antijamming features were incorporated. UHF link signal-to­ jamming ratios of 5to 7 dB had to be maintained to preserve system operation in the presence of CWjamming. With pulse jamming, the signal-to-jamming ratio required appeared to be somewhat higher. The communications performance tests described in Table 4-7 are defined in Table 4-8. (2) The table also includes primary results obtained. A precise evaluation of link parameters was not-obtained, since spin axis attitude. could be determined only from surface temperature sensors and received signal level, and spin rate was determined from the received signal level alone. As a result; highly accurate real time satellite antenna gain data was not available.

Satellite operational results during the 17-day lifetime of Courier lb were described in the discussion.of experiments (Paragraph 4.,5).

However, this resulted in noticeable intermodulation. 4-11 experiment conducted. However, reliabilities of the klystron power amplifiers and low noise parametric amplifier receiver front ends employed were not adequate for an operational system. The major operational. difficulty encountered with the Courier system occurred on October 21, 1960, when the satellite ceased to respond to ground terminal \"turn on\" commands. This left the satellite in an acquisition mode with the UHF communications system and telemetry transmitter deactivated, *and only the VHF beacon transmitter remained active, The exact cause of failure was never determined. Erratic command system in-orbit performance on Courier ,Ib and subsequent life testing of a duplicate satellite model pointed toward a failure of command system circuitry.' The circuitry for cycling the-VHF acquisition receivers \"on\" and\"off\" (I. e., battery saver circuit) was hypothesized as the most likely point of failure. (2) 4-12 CITED REFERENCES 1. P. W.

S. Air Force, into the feasibility of using an orbital array of dipoles as passive reflectors in a global communication system. The communications concept investigated under Project West Ford could, in principle, provide the following: 1. Immediately accessible, continuous, worldwide communication coverage linking widely separated transmitting and receiving terminals without intermediate relay stations. 2 High dependability by virtue of very low vulnerability to disruption by natural or manmade influences. 3. Capability of resisting electronic jamming and compatibility with techniques for providing cryptographic security. 4. Reliability and ease of maintenance and repair, since the space subsystem is passive and the active electronic equipment is on earth, and since relay stations in remote and possibly politically unstable locations are not required. 5. Ability to carry simultaneously a large number of circuits between transmitters and receivers located in widely separated geographical regions. 6. Relative ease of operation, since ground antennas are not required to track the satellite relay- medium at high rates over large angles. 7."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__101", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 101, "text": "politically unstable locations are not required. 5. Ability to carry simultaneously a large number of circuits between transmitters and receivers located in widely separated geographical regions. 6. Relative ease of operation, since ground antennas are not required to track the satellite relay- medium at high rates over large angles. 7. Relative economy of establishment, since only two successful rocket launches could establish the entire satellite portion of a system to provide the performance indicated. 5-1 The principal advantage of the West Ford concept is its great inherent resistance to any damage (natural or other) that could significantly reduce its capability, so worldwide communications could .be maintained under any foreseeable circumstances. The question of possible interference to radio astronomy, optical astronomy, and space travel was under discussion from the outset of Project West Ford. Because of this concern, an ad hoc committee of the Natioiial'Academy of Sciences was established 4hich subsequently recommended that the project be declassified­ and disclosed to the scientific community at large. Opposition to the West Ford project was especially concerned with leaving material that might prove to be consider­ ably harmful in the above-mentioned respects dispersed in space. Late in September 1961\", a special panel of the President's Sciehce Advisory Committee concluded that \"the United States can proceed with the West Ford commun­ ications experiment without danger to science.\" -As a result, a.satellite carrying the West Ford dipole dispenser package was launched on October 21, 1961. The attempt failed because of a mechanical malfunction in the dispenser. The dipoles did not disperse: fragments of the package were observed in orbit by a VHF radar but they could serve no useful communications function.

A year and a half elapsed before a second attempt was made on May 10, 1963. The dipole dispenser was carried into orbit as a piggyback payload on a large parent satellite, and the parent satellite was placed in an approximately polar orbit of about 3700-km altitude. The inclination and altitude were selected to ensure that the dipole belt lifetime would be limited by solar radiation pressure. A radio command signal was employed to release the dipole dispenser. However, due to a 30-minute ejection delay imposed by the mission of the parent vehicle, the dipole dispenser was heated unevenly by the*sun. This caused -imperfect -dispensing'which resulted-in somewhat less than half-the dipoles being dispensed individually Nevertheless, a sufficient number of dipoles were successfully dispensed into orbit to allow experimental investigation2 5-2 The subsequent West Ford space experiment demonstrated that the orbiting dipole technique can provide reliable radio communication over large distances. More specifically, this program demonstrated that: 1. Large quantities of fine microwave dipoles can be fabricated, compactly packaged, launched into orbit about the earth, and dispensed. 2. Large quantities of fine dipoles can be made to form a-compact belt around the -earth of predictable dimensions and within a predictable time period. 3. The orbital perturbations caused by solar radiation pressure and the earth's gravitational field are essentially as predicted by theories developed at Lincoln Laboratory. The .spreading of a dipole belt similar to that deployed, over 7 months' time, is no more than about 200 km ina radial direction from the earth and about 60 km in a direction normal to the orbit plane. 4.

Solar radiation pressure will limit the lifetime of a dipole belt similar to that deployed to about 3 to 5 years. 5 Propagation effects of the dipole scatter medium are as predicted: a multipath time delay spread of about 100 microseconds and a doppler frequency smear of 1 to 2 kHz were observed several months after dispensing. 6. The various modulation-demodulation techniques operate with a dipole belt at close to their predicted performance; communication rates of several tens of thousands of bits per second were achieved soon after dispensing. 7. The interference of a dipole belt similar to that deployed, with radio astronomy measurements, is negligible as might be theoretically predicted. 5-3 5.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The major experiments performed using the dipole belt were conducted with sites in Massachusetts and California operating as monostatic radars, as a bistatic west-to-east radar, and for west-to-east communications. The eastern site was more heavily instrumented as a r6ceiving station and the western site niore as a transmitting station. Profiagation measurements and communications experiments including high-speed data, teletype, and voice were performed. Belt-scattering cross-section and dimension measurements were made by both monostatic and bistatic radar experiments. The results of these experiments are discussed in Paragraph 5.5. .. .' The choice of frequency rangd for Project West Ford was a compromise among many factors. In the upper UHF. and SHF region, atmospheric noise is negligible.

In the upper UHF. and SHF region, atmospheric noise is negligible. Galactic noise is not of great concern at frequencies- above about 1000 -MHz, nor is the influence'of the ionosphere, in either a quiet or disturbed state. At frequencies of some 3000 MHz and higher, the noise contributed by atmospheric attenuation is noticeable in sensitive receivers, and precipitation-induced attenuation begins to be important along long slant paths at frequencies above 6000 MHz. The use of lower frequencies will yield higher values of radiowave cross-section per unit mass for a given dipole thickness; at yery low frequencies,, however, the dipole thickness must be increased to preserve its shape and the greater mass would increase any possible spacecraft collision hazard. In addition, there are greater numbers of more powerful radio equipments operating at the lower frequencies. Signals scattered from a low freqiiency belt by these powerful equipments may cause interference. Consideration of these factors led to the choice of a band of frequencies near 8000 MHz for a test of the orbital scatter technique. The operating frequencies employed in Project West Fdrd are given in table 5-1. 5-4 Table 5-1. Project West Ford Frequencies Millstone Camp Parks Radar Communications.

The second goal was the achieve­ ment of digital data transmission at high rates consistent with the density of the dipoles in orbit. The fact that these two goals were to be achieved at the same point in time required the use of two receivers. The receiver employed for measuring the propagation characteristics of the dipole belt was essentially of the RAKE-type and i-s shown in the block diagram of Figure 5-1. The tap unit. (tapped delay line) outputs are used to form real-time displays of multipath envelope and doppler spectra and to derive error signals for frequency and delay tracking and for gain control. The communication receiver is essentially of the correlation type using quadrature, full wave, square law detection. The block diagram for this receiver is shown in Figure 5-2. 5.3 SPACECRAFT Early in May 1963 a package containing 4. 8 x 108 copper dipoles, each 0. 00178 cm in diameter and-1. 78 cm in leigth, was placed into a nearly circular, nearly polar orbit at a mean altitude of 3650 km. A radio command signal from the ground initiated the release of the dipoles from the package. At first the dipoles formed a rather compact cloud which, due to differential linear velocity increments imparted to each dipole, gradually spread around the orbit.

Block Diagram of Communications Receiver PAGE ISST ORIGINAO POOR QUALIW POF the dipole distribution assumed an approximately toroidal configuration with a circum­ ference of 63, 000 km and cross-seetfon that varied ilorig the orbit, with a mean width of about 15 km and a mean depth (in the orbital plane) of about 30 kin In this condition each dipole was separated from its 'nearest neighbor by an average distance of about 400 m. This tenuous distribution of'orbital dipoles is known as the Project West Ford Dipole Belt. The above description of the dipole belt suggests that it may be considered as a large number of approximately coorbital passive satellite reflectors. Each passive reflector spacecraft takes the form of a short-circuited dipole half-wave 'resonant at a frequency of 8000 MHz The half-wave dipole was selected as the elemental reflect­ br because it achieves a large gain.in scattering cross-section per unit mass (due to resonance effects). In addition, the scattering from a large number of randomly oriented dipoles is essentially nondirectional.. Other passive reflectors which also achieve large gain per unit mass are available (e. g., a flat circular plate), but.most are extremely directional, a severe limitation for use in a sytem of worldwide.coverage. As a consequence of the concern that the dipole belt might result in interference to other scientific endeavdrs, limiting the lifetime of the belt became an 'important goal of the West Ford program. As a result of extensive studies on the orbital properties of the dipole belt, it was determined that the major influence on the perigee height would be solar radiation pressure."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__107", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 107, "text": "interference to other scientific endeavdrs, limiting the lifetime of the belt became an 'important goal of the West Ford program. As a result of extensive studies on the orbital properties of the dipole belt, it was determined that the major influence on the perigee height would be solar radiation pressure. The effect of the solar, radiation pressure would be to drive down the perigee height until the orbit pierced the dense portions of the earth's atmosphere where air drag would exert an additional force to drive down the perigee height still further until the orbit intersected -theearth's surface. From an extrapolatioft of the time behavior of fhe-physical cross-section of the actual belt, it was concluded that 25'percent of the individually orbiting dipoles would cease to orbit after about 2-1/2 years, 50 percent after 3 years, and 100 percent after 5 years. Thus it was expected that the orbits of all separated dipoles would decay by early 1968. 5-7 5.4 'GROUND STATIONS Two ground stations were constructed,, one in Massachusetts (at Millstone Hill in West Ford) and one in California (at Camp Parks in Pleasanton) to use the dipole belt. and to measure its characteristics. The ground stations can transmit and receive CW X-band communications.signals simultaneously. In addition, each station ­ can be changed within minutes to a radar capable of tracking and measuring the characteristics of the dipole belt and other satellites. The characteristics of the ground stations are presented in Table 5-2. 5.5 EXPERIMENTS Two broad investigative programs were- established for determining the feasibility of using the orbital dipole belt as a medium for global 6ommunications.

Physical measurements of the -dipole belt were obtained by three distinct approaches. The first approach involved monostatic pulse radar operations to measure range, angles, andscattering cross-section; The second apptoach involved direct measurement of path loss for bistatic CW transmissions from one side to the other via belt scattering. The ,third approach involved inference concern­ ing belt dimensions which may be made from bistatic measurements of doppler spread. 5-8 Table 5-2.

In measuring orbital parameters, rms deviations normal to the orbital plane averaging 7.5 km and rms deviations'in geocentric radius averaging 9.5 km were observed. The average nodkl period during the first 720 revolutions (the first 80 days of belt life) was found to be 166.455 minutes. From this nodal period the average semimajor axis during this interval was computed to be 1. 57 earth radii. All three physical'measurement approaches were employed in determining belt dimensions. Typical results of these measurements are summarized in Figure 5-3. In this figure, perigee and semi-latus-rectum points are marked and each point on the chart indicates the data sources, the 3-rB in-plane dimension and, except for the inferences from doppler measurements, the 3-dB out-of~plane dimension. Experimental estimates of the number of dipoles in orbit indicated that between 16 and 39 percent of the ejected dipoles were properly dispensed. It alsd appeared that occasionally more than one center of density developed, so that two closely spaced dipole belts were present. This situation is depicted in Figure 5-4.

Each dipole behaves like an independent scatterer, and consequently the received, signal at any given time is the sum 'of the signals scattered by a large numb'er of dipoles. The fact that the dipole scatters are not concentrated at a single point influences the performance of the system in detail. Specification of the received signal-to-noise ratio is notsufficient to characterize a spread dhannel such as the orbital dipole belt.

If the time and frequency behavior of a dispersive medium is sufficiently well-behaved, the two parameters B and L are an-adequate description for the purpose of signal design. A more complete description of the dipole belt is furnished by the so-called scatterinM function of the medium.

Two message sources were available to the transniitter: a fixed word repetition and a standard 60-wpm teletype. In addition, a digitized PCM system was constructed to pro­ vide voice communication in the e~rly stages of the experiment. On May 14 and 15, speech was transmitted using the PCM system. The received speech was intelligible and its general quality varied as the'PlR IN ratio fluctuated about a mean of about 53 dB. Between May 14 and June 18, eight communications experiments were performed. This cqvered the period of time from shortly after initial dispensing to roughly closure time. During all the experiments, therefore, the belt was-incomplete and in each run that portion of the belt spanning the central densest spot was employed. The experimental results were generally in fairly good agreement with the theory. For the most part, the theory overbounned the actual error probability at most by a factor of 2. In summary, the performance of the data comm­ unieations system was found to be in substantial agreement with a theory which assumed the use of an optimum receiver. This is consistent with the above result that the scattering function was adequately described by the two parameters B and L, since the signals were designed under that assumption. 5.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS No operational traffic was carried by this experimental system. The operation­ al reliability of the space subsystem was qffite high due to its passive nature. Finally, the operational performance of the earth terminals employed in the experi­ ments was good, as expected. 5-14 References 1. C. F. J. Overhage and W. H.

Two active spacecraft, Telstar I and Telstar H,-were successfully launched into medium altitude elliptical orbits during the course of the program as indicated by Table 6-2. (1)(2) Numerous communication demonstrations and detailed experiments were successfully conducted with Telstar I during its 7-month lifetime and considerable data on radiation Jn the.inner Van Allen-belt obtained. Before Telstar I finally failed from higher than expected radiation (which had resulted from the high altitude nuclear tests), an initial malfunction of the command circuit was successfully diagnosed from the ground and the satellite was commanded back \"on.\" This ground diagnosis represented a first in satellite communications. Program 6-1 objectives were for the most part met in the Telstar I experiments. Telstar II, launched after the failure of Telstar I, extended the previous experiments and demonstrations. Table 6-2.

Probably the most important contribution of Project Telstar, to satellite communications technology, was to publicize, through numerous television demonstrations, that orbiting satellites were feasible for use in commercial communication systems. From a purely technical viewpoint, one of the most important achievements was to confirm (in basic agreement with Echo I experience) that standard transmission parameters could be employed to predict performance with no concern about multipath fading for frequencies approaching 4 to 6 GHz and 6-2 ground antenna elevation angles greater than a few.degrees. A second technical achievement of major importance was to demonstrate further that acquiring and tracking a moving satellite was not an.overlydemanding assignment for a narrow­ beam communications antenna equipped with an autotrack system.

Major demonstrations were performed over a link between Andover and terminals in Europe or at Holmdel.

(8) The communication frequencies selected were based on considerations of propagation, link noise, bandwidth, hardware available, and, the feasibility of frequency sharing between commercial satellite communications and existing terrestrial services. (3) The bands selected share spectrum occupancy with common carrier line-of-site radio relay'systems. The lower frequency bind was selected for the downlink -because of the reduced effects of precipitation and atmospheric absorption.

Most of the repeater is in broad principle similar to equipment used earlier in land-based microwave systems. Storage batteries and a capability to command equipment \"on\" and \"off\" allowed utilizing a solar array too small to meet real-time power demands but within.weight limitations. Spin stabilizing relative to the sun reduced temperature equalization and solar array illumination problems.

Major characteristics of the predominant participating terminals are described in Table 6-7 (17-26) For communication purposes, circular polarization, corresponding to that of the satellite, was employed at all terminals. This choice avoids the difficulties that Faraday rotation in the ionosphere could present. All of the terminal designs reflect an intense prevailing interest in reducing receive system noise to the very minimum and accurately tracking a moving satellite. The Andover terminal included three separate tracking antennas with their individual associated autotrack systems in addition to a 6apability for computer­ derived programmed tracking. The autotracking systems were all, broadly speaking, of the monopulse type. Major subsystems of the Andover terminal are shown in the block diagrarm of Figure 6-2.

Determinations were made by observing the flashes of sunlight reflected from the three mirrors mounted on the satellite's surface. 6.5 EXPERIMENTS The experiments conducted on the .Telstar project can be grouped into four: major categories as displayed and defined in Table 6-8. The radiation experiments, described in the table, contributed considerable data towards characterizing the particles within the inner and outer Van Allen-belts, Additionally, valuable knowledge of the effects of radiation upon solid-state devices (i. e., upon solar cells and transistors) was gained. The most spectacular radiation experiment result, however, was the discovery, from the data on Telstar I, that-high altitude huclear testing dramatically intensified the radiation environment in the Van Allen belts. (2)(27) The space experiments, defined in Table 6-8, monitored such items as attitude of the spacecraft spin axis in inertial space, spin rate, temperatures at the spacecraft surface and' of critical, internal components, satellite RF power levels, and variations in spacecraft circuitry and components. Changes in spin axis attitude, due to the residual magnetic moment of the spacecraft, were recorded. Spin rate decay, resulting from eddy currents generated in the satellite as it rotates in the earth's magnetic field, was observed. The decay was greater on Telstar I because of its lower orbit. Skin temperatures varied between about 2470 K (-150 F) and 2780 K (400 F). 6-10 Table 6-8. Summary of Program Activities t Type Program Activity Objective Nature of Activity Satisfied , 1.

The only significant changes observed in circuitry or components were a degradation of solar cell output and the failure of several-transistors within the command decoder of Telstar I. Both of these changes were a result of the radiation encountered. The communication demonstrations, mentioned:in Table '6-8, included a variety of tests whose descriptions and results are indicated in Table 6-9.

Most of the impairments to signal transmission were determined to be caused by the ground terminals. In addition to the tests mentioned in Table 6-10, a time syn­ chronization test was conducted. (29) Prec ision atomic clocks in the USA and UK were compared by transmitting pulses simultaneously in both directions. The accuracy of the method was believed to be about 20 ps and a difference in clock time of 2 milliseconds was found. 6.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS No operational traffic was handled during this program due to its experimental nature. Howevqr, the operational performance of the system, as the various experiments were conducted, was of consideiable interest as indicated by Program Objectives S and 4 listed in Table 6-I. OperatibnMl performance of the two satellites was as discussed in the description of program experiments in Paragraph 6. 5. The ground complex operations displayed that satellite communications ground terminals of satisfactory reliability to provide continuous commercial service were feasible. The performance demonstration included showing a capability for dependable satellite acquisitions and accurately tracking moving satellites. Satellite tracking turned out to be less difficult than expected and special purpose tracking antennas were determinednot necessary. Perhaps the most spectacular ground operational result was produced by the malfunction of the command circuit on Telstar I on November 24, 1962.

Telstar I and I1 Communication Experiments Type Experiment Nature of Results Obtained 1. Received Carrier Power Measured values, in general, agreed with pre­ dicted values when range and spin axis aspect angle of satellite are taken into account. Varia­ tions in received power clearly showed satellite rotation, changes in aspect angle and changes in -range. No noticeable multipath fading observed at Andover for elevation angles above about 49 or at Goonhilly for elevation angles above about 3. 2. Frequency Baseband response essentially flat up to 5 MHz Responses when conventional FM receiver was used. For FMFB receiver response flat up to 3 MHz. All of response limitations appeared to be due to ground terminal equipment employed. 3. Noise Baseband noise performance, for various signals employed, defined in Table 6-9. Measurements for impulse noise indicated only random thermal noise'present. Satellite repeater noise spectrum on Telstar I observed to display considerable peaking around communications carrier fre­ quency. This gives effective noise figure over 20 MHz of about 16.5 dB +2 dB. 4. Amplitude and Phase Measurements of envelope delay, differential Distortion gain and phase, and intermodulation noise taken. Performance measured for television and 600­ channel telephony indicate objectives* for these measurements met. Additionally, no audio to video crossmodulation interference observed and video to audio crossmodulation not signifi­ cant. 5. Doppler Shift Measured and calculated curves of Doppler shift agreed within 1 kHz over period of about 45 mins."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__129", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 129, "text": "Performance measured for television and 600­ channel telephony indicate objectives* for these measurements met.

The objectives of the program were: 1. To demonstrate the feasibility of relaying wideband communication signals between ground stations via satellite relays in low altitude orbits 2. To evaluate spacecraft performance and to test the life of communication satellite system components in the orbital environment, and 3. To measure the amount of radiation encountered, its effect on solar cells and diodes, and the effectiveness of various amounts of shielding. The spacecraft for this program were designed and manufactured by Astro- Electronics Division of the Radio Corporation of America, based on system engi­ neering studies by Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge Systems Group. The Relay program was directed by NASA (GSFC). Two active satellites, Relay I and Relay IU, were successfully launched into medium altitude elliptical orbits. Relay I was launched on December 13, 1962, and Relay II on January 21, 1964. The orbital parameters for both spacecraft are shown in Table 7-1.

Relay I and II were basically of the same design, although certain modifications were introduced into Relay II based on operating experiences with Relay I. These modifications included the use of n-on-p instead of p-on-n solar cells and changes in the wideband repeater high-power regulator circuitry. The primary earth terminals participating in the Relay Program are listed in Table 7-2. Tracking and telemetry data were provided by the NASA worldwide network of Minitrack stations. 7-1 Table 7-1.

Major difficulties included the power regulator failure on Relay I and a satellite command receiver susceptibility to spurious signals. As a result of the power regulator failure, it was recognized that dew point criteria and leakage tests had to be included in all future power transistor procurement specifications and that equipment should be tested throughout the temperature range, rather than at specific maximum, mini­ mum, and typical values. The command receiver spurious responses resulted in a recommendation that more complex command signals be designed for all future spacecraft. 7.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Relay system consisted of the orbiting satellite, the complex of partici­ pating ground"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__134", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 134, "text": "the temperature range, rather than at specific maximum, mini­ mum, and typical values.

The orbit was selected to meet the following requirements: 1. To maximize satellite mutual visibility above a 5-degree horizon between U.S. and Europe. A minimum of 100 minutes per day during the first 30 days was the achieved design objective 2. To provide acceptable mutual visibility times for the test stations and smaller ground stations 3. To traverse a radiation environment suitable for evaluation by the on-board radiation experiments 4. To minimize the simultaneous occurrence of mutual visibility times and eclipses 7-4 5. The sun look angle was to lie between 90 + 15 degrees for the first 30 days in orbit with a maximum deviation of + 31 degrees for a year's orbit 6. The launch trajectory was to be consistent with the range safety require­ ments at the Atlantic Missile Range. Relay 11 was launched into a slightly higher orbit because of improved launch vehicle performance. 7.3 SPACECRAFT Except as noted, the Relay I and Relay II spacecraft exhibited no essential differences.

The principal characteristics of the spacecraft are presented in Table 7-4. Two completely independent microwave transponders were provided for increased reliability; their configuration is shown in Figure 7-1. Two modes of operation were available with the transponder. The wideband mode was utilized for one-way wideband communications such as television or 300 channels of telephony. The narrowband mode was utilized for two-way communications such as 12-channel two-way telephony. In the narrow-band mode, two ground stations could commu­ nicate with each other, one transmitting on 1723.33 MHz, the other transmitting on 1726. 67 MHz. The spacecraft transponder converted these frequencies to 4165 VFHz and 4175 MHz, respectively.

The microwave antennas were circularly polarized biconical horns with nominally onmidirectional patterns about the spin axis to prevent amplitude modulation. Vertical coverage (in the plans of the spin axis) extended from 40 to 115 degrees (-1 dB points). In addition, this particular antenna system provided decoupling between the two trans­ mitters and receiver of the spacecraft without any switches, thereby reducing losses and increasing reliability. Further details on the microwave antenna can be found in Appendix 7-A. The VHF antenna consisted of 4 monopoles extending out from the bottom mounting ring face of the spacecraft. For command reception the antenna elements were fed in phase to produce a dipole-like pattern; while for telemetry and tracking transmission they were fed pairwise in phase quadrature to produce a circularly polarized wave in the plane perpendicular to thespin axis.

In any planes parallel to the spin axis the wave was linearly polarized. All spacecraft power was generated by solar cells. Storage batteries charged by the solar cells were used to supply the peak power necessary for repeater opera­ tion. On Relay I the solar cells were boron-doped silicon cells, p-on-n, gridded and covered with 60-mil thick fused sheets. To decrease solar cell degradation due to radiation, n-on-p cells were used on the solar array of Relay II. In addition to the communications repeaters, and other subsystems needed to support the principal mission of Relay, the spacecraft carried a group of components to obtain data on particle radiation in space. These consisted of six radiation detec­ tors and a collection of isolated solar cells and semiconductor diodes. The latter were accumulated on a \"radiation-damage-effects\" panel. 7.4 EARTH STATIONS Some of the major earth stations participating in Project Relay are described in Table 7-5 in terms of their basic characteristics. In the Relay system, the stations at Nutley and Mojave were designated as Test Stations and, as such, had prime responsibility to command the satellite and monitor telemetry. Other stations par­ ticipating in the program under agreements with NASA were designated as Ground 7-7 Table 7-5.

This center also provided a centralized command post to exercise control over the satel­ lite. Supporting activities included telemetry data processing, orbital prediction, and satellite tracking information. 7.5 EXPERIMENTS Each of the participating stations was asked to submit a detailed experiment .plan concerning those tests in which that particular station would participate. The communications experiments were divided into three classifications: wideband per­ formance experiments, narrowband performance experiments, and system demon­ stration experiments. System performance experiments -wideband and narrowband ­ were intended as objective tests to obtain quantitative and statistical data on the electrical parameters of the system by analyzing the response to carefully controlled executions. The various major types of experiments prepared for the Relay program are outlined in Table 7-6. Details of the experiments were given in the Relay Com­ munications Experiment Plan (RI-0521A). This plan gave the general purpose and description of the individual experiments, and the test procedures for each of the stations. In order to make the most effective use of the entire Relay system, which included the complex of participating earth stations as well as the satellite, it was necessary to schedule the communications experiments with some care. Experiment schedules were initially planned over a 1-month period. It was found useful early in the program to assign operational days during each week to designated stations, with the days assigned arbitrarily. Examination of orbital data *ould then indicate which passes on each day were usable for the station designated for that day. For detailed experimental results the reader is referred to the bibliography. General conclusions were as follows: 7-9 Table 7-6. Major Relay Communication Experiments I.

Some mapping of the electron and proton fields in the Relay orbit was also accomplished. 7.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The objectives of the Relay program were entirely experimental in nature; therefore, no operational traffic was handled. The program was extraordinarily successful with malfunctions in either the satellites or ground complex being infre­ quent. However, it was not entirely free of operational difficulties. Most trouble­ some was an,inability to turn off one, of the high power regulators and its associated wideband repeater on Relay I. Analysis indicated that excessive reverse leakage current in the high power regulator series pass transistors prevented the regulator from being shut off. The cause of this excessive, reverse leakage current was appar­ ently moisture precipitating on the active surface of the transistor as the junction temperature passed through the transistor's dew point temperature. After about 12 7-11 months operation the problem seemed to disappear, perhaps due to the evaporation of the condensation into the vacuum of space.

THE RELAY MICROWAVE ANTENNA The microwave antenna requirement for the Relay spacecraft included: 1. Omnidirectional pattern about the spin-axis 2. Coverage from near 350 to 1200 in zenith angle as measured from the spin axis 3. Circular Polarization 4. Sufficient decoupling between the two Relay transmitters to prevent the inactive one from loading the active one 5. Sufficient decoupling between transmitters and receiver. These requirements were met in a unique slotted waveguide antenna designed by 0. M. Woodward of RCA. The transmitting portion of the antenna was comprised of five parts: the mode transducer, the coaxial wavequide transmission line, the quarter­ wave plate, the inclined-slot exciters, and the radial waveguide. The mode transducer consists of two de-coupled input ports near the base of the antenna. With this the input coaxial TEM mode line can feed the coaxial TE 1-mode waveguide transmission line. The two input ports were oriented at right angles so that the TE modes excited in the coaxial waveguide would be orthogonal. In addition, the transmitter ports were one guide wavelength apart to reduce direct cross-coupling between them. To provide still further isolation, a quarter-wave plate consisting of two longitudinal metal ridges attached on opposite sides of the coaxial waveguide inner conductor was employed to convert the linearly polarized waves from the separate input ports to circularly polarized waves of opposite rotational sense. The radiator itself consisted of eight slots inclined at an angle of 55' and equally spaced about"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__144", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 144, "text": "metal ridges attached on opposite sides of the coaxial waveguide inner conductor was employed to convert the linearly polarized waves from the separate input ports to circularly polarized waves of opposite rotational sense. The radiator itself consisted of eight slots inclined at an angle of 55' and equally spaced about the outer conductor. Because the radial and tangential components of the field radiated by these slots were observed to be inphase, a radial wavegaide, constructed from two parallel metal discs, was employed to obtain the quadrature phasing required for circularly polarized radiation. The phase velocity of the axial component was unaffected by these discs. The phase 7-13 velocity of the tangential component, however, was a function of the spacing. Hence, by proper choice of spacing and diameter, a differential phase-shift of 900 between these two components was obtained, to produce circular polarization of the plane normal to the spin axis. The receiving portion of the antenna consisted of three parts: the transmission line, the inclined radiating slots, and the radial waveguide. Only a single port antenna was needed for reception as the two receivers were joined in parallel. The receiving antenna was mounted above the transmitting antenna and connected to the receiving port by a coaxial transmission line' residing interior to the coaxial line of the trans­ mitting antenna. The receiving radial waveguide acts similarly to that of the trans­ mitter in causing a 900 phase shift between the orthogonal, axial and tangential, electric-field components. The slots are oppositely inclined to those of the transmitter, resulting in opposite sense, circular polarization. 7-14 RELATED REFERENCES 1. B. N. Abramson and M. A.

(1) Project Syncom was initiated as a joint NASA/DOD development in August, 1961. The major objectives of this program were to develop the capability of launching satellites into earth synchronous orbits and to demonstrate the utility of this type of orbit for satellite communications. (2) Three spacecraft were launched during the course of completing Project Syncom, as indicated in Table 8-1. (4) (5) (6) Syncom I went totally silent during the firing of its apogee motor in an attempt to complete injection into a synchronous inclined orbit. Subsequent optical sitings revealed that the desired orbit was attained to partially satisfy the program objectives. Syncom II was successfully launched into a synchronous inclined orbit and initially positioned over Brazil at 550 W. longitude. It was later moved to a final location over the Indian Ocean. Numerous experiments and demonstrations were conducted to satisfy all program objectives. Subsequent to the initial successful operations with Syncom 11, the Thrust Augmented Delta rocket became available, making possible further improvements in the synchronous orbit injection technology. This launch vehicle allowed Syncom III to be successfully placed into a synchronous equatorial orbit (i. e., a geostationary orbit). The satellite was positioned over the Pacific International Date Line and additional communications measurements and demonstrations were conducted. With all of the Syncom programs' experimental objectives attained, Syncoms II and III were turned over to DOD in early 1965 to provide an operational communications capability serving the Far East, Pacific Ocean and Western United States.

The NASA Worldwide Minitrack network collected tracking and telemetry data. Selected newly procured tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) terminals were also pro­ vided by NASA. One of the most important of these was located on the Kingsport. The great contribution of Project Syncom to satellite communications technology was to display the feasibility of placing satellites into synchronous equatorial orbits and maintaining precision stationkeeping and attitude control. The synchronous equatorial orbit significantly reduced the ground terminal tracking requirements and made it possible to establish an essentially worldwide communications system with as few as three or four satellites. The only earth areas without satellite visibility in such a system are the regions immediately around the North and South Poles. The high altitude of the synchronous orbit and the capability to precisely maintain the satellite's spin axis at a 900 attitude relative to the orbital plane made it possible to employ antennas providing pancake-shaped radiation patterns of significantly higher gain than the previous essentially omnidirectional satellite antennas.

After the satellite was repositioned over the Indian Ocean, tests were conducted employing principally the Asmara, Philippines, and Thailand terminals. Tests involving Syncom III included the Camp Roberts, Hawaii, Viet Nam, Kingsport, USS Canberra, USS Midway, Kashima, and Point Mugu terminals, among others. Practically all transmissions over either satellite were conducted on a loop-back basis or over a single link between two terminals. Both half and full duplex links were established. Typical earth coverages supplied by the synchronous orbits of Syncoms 11 and III are illustrated in Figure 8-1. (9) The significantly smaller area of 24-hour earth 8-4 coverage provided by Syncom II is due to its inclined orbit resulting in a daily figure eight earth trace of the subsatellite point.

Characteristics of these terminals are presented in Table 8-6. (3) (6) (9) (11) (14) (15) Major subsystems of the ground facilities placed aboard the Kingsport are shown in Figure 8-3. (3) The AN/FSC-9 and AN/MSC-44 terminal installations did not, in general, include the TT&C antenna and system. The transmit and receive polarizations available at the AN/MSC-44 and Kingsport terminals were compatible with those of the Syncom sattellites. In contrast, the receive polarization of the AN/FSC-9 terminals was such that a S-dB polarization loss was suffered. By choosing circular polarization, however, it was no longer necessary to track variations in the linear polarization received from the satellite. The AN/FSC-9 and AN/MSC-44 terminals employed two axis (i. e., azimuth and elevation) tracking and control of the antenna. The Kingsport terminal was provided with a three-axis antenna, however, to ensure a capability for near zenith operation from the rolling and pitching ship. 8.5 EXPERIMENTS Experiments conducted on project Syncom are grouped in five major categories and defined in Table 8-7. Synchronous orbit injection was successfully completed on Syncoms I, Hl and IlI. In the latter case, a synchronous equatorial orbit was realized. Spacecraft stationkeeping and attitude control were sticcessfully maintained on Syncoms I1and IIl. In the process- of stationkeeping, considerable data on the triaxial nature of the earth and the drift of synchronous satellites was generated. (16) (17) (18) 8-9 Table 8-6.

Thousands of successful special tests and demonstrations were performed over the Syncom satellites. These include numerous demonstrations of teletype, telephony, and facsimile. Special demonstrations displayed vocoder operation, multiple access using spread spectrum, real time relaying of satellite telemetry, transmission of oceanographic data, continuous 24-hour auto-tracking, 28 hours of continuous com­ munications with the Kingsport while underway at sea, and direct teletype communica­ tions with an aircraft in flight. The latter employed the VHF command receiver and telemetry transmitter on Syncom 1i. (19) Special occurrences among the demonstrations included President J. F. Kennedy speaking from the White House to the Prime Minister of Nigeria; President Kennedy's address to the United Nations; conversations between participants in the 1963 Extraor­ dinary Administrative Radio Conference of the ITU in Geneva, Switzerland, and mem­ bers of the U.N. in New York; and international TV coverage of the Olympics from Japan in October, 1964.

The demonstrations also displayed that satellite time delay and echo could be overcome. However, to accomplish the latter it was found necessary to maintain incoming conventional phone line levels at -15 dBm or above with the 8-11 equipment employed. The time delay presented few psychological problems even with unexpectant speakers. The communications performance experiments described in Table 8-7 are de­ fined and their basic results presented in Table 8-8. (3) (4) (15) (19) Results indicated are for half duplex operation. The Syncom II television transmissions involved a wide­ band FM modulator at Fort Dix. At the receive end, the Bell Telephone Laboratory's Andover terminal was outfitted with a maser preamplifier operating at the Syncom frequencies. The Syncom HI Japan to California television test was the 1964 TV cover­ age of the Olympics. Television p-p signal to weighted rms noise ratios would be about 8 dB better than the unweighted values indicated in the table. This means signals were quite viewable but not of high quality. The communications technical characteristic measurements noted in Table 8-7 are described in Table 8-9. (3) (4) In addition to the tests mentioned, the frequency response of the 50-kHz transponder on Syncom HI was measured. It displayed an 87­ kHz bandwidth at the 3-dB points. Further, measurements of the Faraday rotation of the 137-MHz telemetry signal from Syncom Inl provided considerable data on the electron content of the ionosphere.

During the initial experimental period of the program, operational responsibility for the Syncom satellites rested with NASA while DOD operated and maintained the ground communi­ cations terminals. In early 1965, DOD added the satellites \"toits operational respolisi­ bilities and employed them to provide operational military communications for the Far East, Pacific Ocean area, and Western United States. During all of the time the Syncom satellites were actively employed, no significant operational difficulties were encountered. Minor difficulties included a slight gas leak, a buildup of H202 pressure, and one receiver occasionally going into oscillation upon turn on under high space­ craft temperature conditions. Ground terminal operation and tracking was, in general, routine. 8-12 4 Table 8-8. Communications Performance Experiments TYPE EXPERIMENT NATURE OF RESULTS OBTAINED 1.

Early work was with ionospheric and tropospheric scatter systems. The scatter 'concept was extended, under U. S. Air Force sponsorship, to the West Ford Program. Upon successfully concluding Project West Ford, the Laboratory's program aims were recast, in 1963, towards developing active communications satellite techniques. (1) This program, also under Air Force sponsorship, has made use of the original West Ford ground terminals as well as small mobile ground terminals to communicate through a series of Laboratory-developed satellites designated the Lncoln Experi­ mental Satellitew (LES). Lincoln Laboratory's active communications satellite program has been con­ cerned with the development and testing of new spacecraft and ground terminal tech­ niques having application to military command and control. (2) The objective of the spacecraft techniques investigations has centered on obtaining the maximum satellite effective radiated power for a given satellite mass. In agreement with this objective, research has been conducted on improved spacecraft power-generation systems, high efficiency spacecraft transmitters, high-gain spacecraft antennas, and spacecraft attitude stabilization and stationkeeping systems. The surface terminal techniques investigation has focused on developing methods of more effectively utilizing a given radio signal strength generated by a communications satellite. Areas of interest have included the development of efficient modulation-demodulation systems, random multiple access techniques having no stringent synchronization and control requirements, source signal encoding techniques that reduce required user data rates, low noise receiving systems, and simple antenna systems suitable for small"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__166", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 166, "text": "signal strength generated by a communications satellite. Areas of interest have included the development of efficient modulation-demodulation systems, random multiple access techniques having no stringent synchronization and control requirements, source signal encoding techniques that reduce required user data rates, low noise receiving systems, and simple antenna systems suitable for small terminals. In the first phase of the program, particular attention was given to X-band fre­ quencies in the vicinity of the microwaVe bands allocated for military communications. 9-1 This emphasis was a natural extension of the X-band capabilities developed during the Project West Ford experiment. (3) In the second phase of the program, attention has been focused on frequencies in the 225 to 400 MHz UIHF communications band. This I band is used for a wide variety of United States government communications services,: to date, six satellites, LES-1 through -6, have been launched as part of this I program and employed in experiments. LES-7 was conceived as a high ERP, three axis stabilized, 136- to 227 kilogram (300- to 500-pound) satellite using a lens antenna and a 19 horn feed cluster to provide a composite beam whose shape could be varied by ground command to fit the earth coverage requirements of a particular link. This sat­ ellite would have operated at X-band but funding considerations plus a greater interest in experiments at the UHF frequencies resulted in its cancellation. Presently, plans exist for a LES-8 and LES-9 to be launched in the spring of 1975. These are experi­ mental \"survivable satellites\" which are to be placed into an elliptical 40 degree in­ clined synchronous orbit. This orbit will result in a fat figure-eight ground track, will provide polar coverage, and will enhance the satellites' survivability by making them harder to locate and track.(3 a) The system will employ frequency hopping"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__167", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 167, "text": "satellites\" which are to be placed into an elliptical 40 degree in­ clined synchronous orbit. This orbit will result in a fat figure-eight ground track, will provide polar coverage, and will enhance the satellites' survivability by making them harder to locate and track.(3 a) The system will employ frequency hopping spread­ spectrum techniques to combat enemy jamming. (3b) No further unclassified information is available on the LES-8 and LES-9 satellites. 9.2 X-BAND SATELLITES 9. 2.1 General Description Specific objectives of the satellites and earth terminals included in this portion of the LES program are listed in Table 9-1.

LES-1 was correctly injected, by its launch vehicle, into an -inclined medium altitude circular orbit. However, a design flaw inrthe satellite's ordnance circuity prevented ignition and separation of the rocket motor supplied for final orbit injection. This left the combination in the medium altitude circular orbit instead of a 2, 778 by 14, 816 km (1500 by 8000 nautical mile) inclined elliptical orbit as planned. At separation from the launch vehicle, the satellite-rocket motor com­ bination was spun up about the axis of least inertia to 180 rpm. When the rocket motor failed to separate, spin axis conversion immediately started to occur. Before it was completed, .a few initial commun ications tests were conducted.

LES-2 was successfully launched along with the Lincoln Calibration Sphere (LCS)-1 later in 1965. This satellite was almost identical to LES-i. With the benefit of a revision of the satellite's ordnance circuitry, it was placed into the type of orbit that had been plannedLfor LES-1. Numerous communications experiments were conducted with this satellite and all objectives listed in Table 9-1, with the exception of Item 5, were accomplished. The satellite contained no experiment measuring the space radiation environment. LES-4 was launched along with LES-3, Oscar 4, and OV2-3 as a secondary payload aboard the third flight test of the Titan HIC. LES-3 was a UHF Lincoln Experimental Satellite operating as a radio signal generator. Oscar 4 was an amateur radio communications satellite for use by \"Hams\" throughout the world. OV2-3 was a scientific satellite to gather data on solar and geomagnetic activity by measuring changes in cosmic ray and trapped particle fluxes. The objective was to place LES-3 and LES-4 into near synchronous (i.e., 33,706 kilometers (18,200 nautical miles)), cir­ cular orbits having a 0° inclination. After a near perfect injection into parking and transfer orbits, the Titan HI C third stage failed to ignite and LES-3 and LES-4 were ejected into highly elliptical inclined orbits. 9-3 Table 9-2.

Parameters of LIES-4 were altered by atmospheric drag due to the low perigee. I LES-4's initial spin axis orientation was such that solar panel illumination pro­ vided telemetry power only. By-late 1965, a residual magnetic moment'along the spin axis had precessed the spin vector until the sun was only 470 below the satellite equator. This provided sufficient solar power to allow operation of all systems. As a result of the unplanned orbit, one of the two onboard antenna switching control systems and the magnetic spin axis orientation system could not be operated.

The LET-i terminal was located adjacent to the Lincoln Laboratory's Facilities in Lexington. The other two LET terminals consisted of a LET-I type signal processing van utilized with existing antennas and RE equipment. LET-2 employed the 18-meter (60-foot) West Ford antenna and X-band RF equipment at Millstone Hill. LET-3 employed the 9.1-meter (30-foot) antenna and X-band RF equipment of the Armyts.transportable Mark 1A terminal.

The-fe--iTifl y-and-eor_­ mance capabilities of electronically switched despun antennas were demonstrated. A workable automatic magnetic spin axis torquing system for attitude correction was exhibited. The performance potential available through the application of convolution encoding and sequential decoding to satellite links was displayed. Frequency hopping was shown to be a satisfactory means of multiple access having no stringent synchroni­ zation requirements and giving considerable protection against interfering signals. Finally, the capabilities of both pitch-excited and voice-excited vocoders, when used over a satellite link, were demonstrated. The former handled speakers at the 9-6 satellite ground terminal while the latter allowed remote speakers, connected through the normal switched telephone network, to use low rate digital satellite voice circuits. 9.2.2 System Description The West Ford terminals contained conventional analog voice signal processing and frequency modulation equipment while the newly developed LET terminals were equipped for digital signal processing. As a result, the three LET terminals inter­ operated independent of the West Ford terminals. Individual terminal loop back tests plus half and full duplex two-terminal operations were conducted.

However, the LET ter­ minal approach to modulation made multiple access a real possibility even for operation with hard limiting satellites. Operating frequehcies for the X-band Lincoln Experimental Satellites are shown in Table 9-40 ). By choosing the X-band frequencies for communications experiments, it was possible to make use of ground terminal facilities previously developed for Project West Ford. More important, however, it afforded the opportunity in accordance with the program objectives, to conduct tests and develop experimental hardware operating at frequencies internationally allocated for military satellite communications.

At the 5-kbps rate, an information bit was fed to the encoder every 200 Ps. The encoder generated three parity check bits based on the 60 preceding information bits. These four bits were employed to select one of 16 channel frequencies every 200 gs. At the receiver the match filter outputs were sampled every 200 gs and ordered accord­ ing to magnitude. The seven samples of largest magnitude were fed to the sequential decoder which recovered the original information bits. Analogous operation occurred at the 10 kbps rate. In this case, one parity check bit was generated for each input information bit and two information and two check bits were used to select 1 of 16 channel frequencies. At the 200 bps rate, 24 successive 200 As pulses carried the same information while the 25th pulse was a synchronization pulse. At the receiver, the matched filter outputs were integrated over 24 successive pulses before ordering the samples and decoding. This signalling system guaranteed accurate transmission at low values of Eb/N o . To convert this into multiple-access, or anti-interference operation, theblock of 16 channel frequencies employed in any 200 us symbol interval was, itself, pseudorandomly hopped over the 20 MHz bandwidth of the terminal and satellite RF systems. Since the frequency hopping occurred only every 200 1s, the signal acquisition and synchronization requirements were modest as compared to a pseudonoise spectrum spreading system.

The two vocoder systems were provided in one unit capable of two modes of operation. Both modes provided a high degree of intelligibility and speaker recognizability. In the pitch-excited mode, a high fidelity input was required as provided by the high quality microphone at the LET terminal. When operated at the higher data rate, the vocoder was used in the voice-excited mode, allowing the use of a degraded input, including a \"phone patch\" connection to the commercial telephone plant. 9.2--3 Spacecraft Characteristics of the communications-related subsystems of the LES-1, 2 & 4 spacecraft are given in Table 9-6(1) (8) (11). The LES-1 and 2 satellites were nearly identical in all respects and the transponder, aboard all three spacecraft, was basically the same. A simplified block diagram of the transponder is shown in Figure 9-2.

Assuming a circular orbit, this allowed predictions of earth direction to be derived as a function of orbital position. The transponder was the same as that on LES-2 except for changes in the crystal mixer, IF amplifier, directional couplers, and power monitoring circuits. An isolator was eliminated, line lengths reduced, and connectors matched at operating frequencies. These changes increased-transmitter power-by 3 dB and suppressed spurious frequencies. The autonomous magnetic torquing system generated two orthogonal axes in inertial space and measured spin axis orientation relative to these 9-12 axes once per orbit at points, 90* apart, where the satellite orbit intersected these fixed axes.

The use of cir­ cularly polarized antenna feeds made the terminal compatible with the circular polari­ zation employed by the X-band antennas on LES-1, -2, and -4. In addition to its signal processing, the LET system included another novel innovation. It incorporated a small general purpose digital computer (UNIVAC 1218) as an integral part of the cpmmunications terminal. The computer system was assigned four major tasks. It derived pointing angle inputs to the antenna servo system. This computation also produced range and Doppler estimates for use in time and frequency synchronization. The computer generated displays for terminal operators and provided flexible operating controls. Further, it handled vocoder and teletype message traffic multiplexing/demultiplexing. 9.2.5 Experiments Experiments conducted during the X-band portion of the LES program may be grouped into six major categories as indicated in Table 9-8() (4) (9). The automatic magnetic torquing experiment was a success on LES-2 where, after several months, the spin axis settled into an average 12' position away from perpendicular to the satellite-sun line. The spin axis oscillated ±70 about this position with a period of 135 days( 1). Automatic magnetic torquing of the spin axis could not be accomplished on LES-I and -4, however, due to the tumbling mode assumed and improper orbit respectively. The space radiation experiment was conducted on LES-4 exclusively. With the highly elliptical orbit attained, LES-4 supplied extensive data on the energy spectrum of trapped electrons in five energy ranges from 130 keV to 4 MeV and at altitudes from 185 to 33,706 kilometers (100to 18,200 nautical miles)( 1 ) .

Five solid state detectors were employed. A sixth detector was continually exposed to a source of known intensity and served as a calibration sensor such that the degradation of the five detectors due to the space radiation environment could be determined. Three of 9-15 the five detectors were shielded silicon cells while the other two were CdTe thin film cells. Results on the CdTe cells, as constructed, indicated they could not satisfactorily withstand a space environment(1S). Earth. albedo measurements were also made as an additional experiment on the earth environment(14)(15) Table 9-8.

On LES-1, the switched antenna functioned as expected during most of the first 10 orbital revolutions until conversion to the 60-rpm tumbling mode was completed (1 6 ) . On LES-2 operation was satisfactory and in agreement with expectations. The use 9-16 of conventional optics at visible wavelengths in conjunction with logic initially designed for IR sensors resulted in some anomalous operation (1 ) . 'Near satellite sunrise and sunset, the logic tended to lock on the sun rather than the earth. Moreover, the logic tended to point antennas toward the middle -of the dlluminated crescent rather than at the middle of the earth. The'se difficulties were- not 6rucial as the ground sites operated with daylight at both transmitter and receiver. On LES-4 the antenna system which measured earth direction during every satellite rotation also operated essentially correct. Operation occasionally broke up for typically tens of minutes in a 8-hour pass due to a defective circuit (14 ) . The second switching logic system on LES-4 could not operate properly at all since the satellite was not in a circular orbit. Measurements on the LET system included evaluations of the performance of RF equipment, antenna system, and signal processing system. In the two former areas, transmitter output power, receiver noise temperature, system bandwidth, (17)and antenna autotrack capability were particular parameters of interest These measurements demonstrated performance in agreement with specified values.

Theory and-b opractice were in almost perfect agreement when 0.3 dB of loss due to non-ideal matched filters and another 0. 3 dB of loss due to non-ideal pulsed signals (i. e., the switching time of the frequency synthesizer was 2-4 gs) were taken into considera­ ('7)tion. The one-way delay induced by the sequential decoder was about 200 ls The satellite X-band transponder received considerable operational evaluation on LES-2 and LES-4. Satellite EIRP, receiver noise figure, bandwidth, frequency stability, and beacon performance were all monitored and found to be the same as 9-17 measured during prelaunch checkouts (1 9 ) . LES-1's transponder was operated for a short time until the satellite assumed its tumbling mode and the transponder performed (1 6 ) as expected The satellite system performance tests and their results are summarized in Table 9-9 (9) (11) (16) (19) (20) These tests were-conducted with LES-2 arid LES-4.

The solar array output on LES-1 had degraded significantly by September of 1965 due to the satellite being left in a circular orbit within the Van Allen Belt(19) With LES-2 being in an elliptical orbit having an apogee out of the area of severe Van Allen Belt radiation, its solar array did not show significant degradation until mid 1966(6). Even then the difficulties were not severe enough to impair transponder or telemetry operation. The Lincoln Experimental Terminals provided generally reliable performance. One significant initial difficulty was due to the installation of the general purpose computer. Its inclusion resulted in certain equipment malfunctions being difficult to localize because \"everything was so connected. 11(9) When this became clear, special troubleshooting programs and techniques were designed. With these techniques, the computer became an asset since it could test all interconnecting equipment. 9.3 UHF SATELLITES 9.3.1 General Description On October 2, 1965 a Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum titled \"Tactical Satellite Communications Research and Development\" inaugurated the U.S. military's TACSATCOM experimental program.

Communications failed only when interference forced the communications downlink signal to drop below receiver threshold. Spreading from -frequency hopping varied over 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 MHz. No change in signal processing threshold occurred except at the 20 MHz rate. At this rate, band­ pass limitations of the satellite and terminals caused some degradation. For operation above threshold, both vocoded modes displayed essentiallythe same performance as found in LET \"back-to-back\" tests. Performance compared to pseudonoise for a broad class of jammers. Results classified. satellite power varying with temperature, age and inexact aiming of satellite antennas; terminal receive noise temperature varying with weather conditions and antenna elevation angle; path loss varying with weather conditions, satellite range, and antenna elevation angle; terminal calibration changing with age; and satellite and terminal bandpass not being entirely flat. **Theoretical threshold occurs at a received power to noise density ratio (P/No) of 43 dB based on an Eb/No of 6 dB and a 4.8 kbps vocoder data rate.

These successes were attained in spite of a number of minor spacecraft. failures.

LES-6 and the ground terminals operating with it provided experiments aimed at'meeting all of the objectives listed in Table 9-10. Shortly after orbital injection it was observed that the satellite was spinning about an axis offset about 2. 2* from the axis of symmetry of the cylinder (i. e., nutating). Additionally one solar panel, lying in the plane defined by the actual spin axis and the axis of symmetry, was providing a severely reduced power output ( 2 9 ) The exact cause of these seemingly related difficulties was not determined. It was hypothesized that the satellite unbalance and resultant spin axis offset was produced by about 0. 5 kilograms (1.1 pounds) of weight added to the outside surface of the cylinder. One theory suggested that an object was caught on a'dipole antenna and was shadowing the solar panel. The net effect was to make the automatic attitude control system unusable and produce a spin rate modulation of the solar array de power out­ put that resulted in a similar modulation of the RF power output.

The satellite was allowed to drift from its initial position to about 930 W longitude and was maintained at this location by the automatic stationkeeping system for several months. During these initial months in orbit, the satellite was employed by tactical terminals of all of the U. S. armed services in tri-service tests and all of the objectives listed in Table 9-10, with the exception of Item.7, were successfully accomplished. On July 23, 1969 a program was initiated to move LES-6 further eastward to about 401V longitude so that the NATO countrieg of Europe could view the spacecraft (3 0 ).

Spacecraft launchings were provided by the U. S. Air Force. The UHF LES program resulted in numerous advancements in technology available to support the design of satellite communications systems. It significantly advanced the state of knowledge of UHF propagation and the UHF noise environment including RF interference. In particular, the studies characterized propagation and noise pertinent to systems involving small mobile aircraft, ship, vehibular and manpack terminals. Workable experimental tactical communications terminals, including antennas and modems, were developed and demonstrated. The feasibility of high efficiency UHF satellite transmitters operating directly from an unregulated solar array power supply was displayed accurate autonomous attitude control of spin-stabilized near-synchronous satellites was exhibited. The feasibility of autonomous stationkeeping and station changing was demdnstrated. These two automatic control concepts could ultimately greatly 'simplify the heed for g'round control operations and ground tracking requirements. -This may become important as the number of satellites in orbit increases and the separation between them decreases. In addition, an electronically switched despun antenna system successfully operating at UHF frequencies was displayed. 9.3.2 System Description Numerous linking arrangements were devised among the many terminals participating in tests. The tests included individual terminal loop back, two terminal hald duplex, full duplex, and multiple access tests. Many of these tests centered upon the Lexington terminal.

In the very constrained physical environ­ ment of a small mobile terminal, and in particular in the environment of.an ­ aircraft, it is highly desirable to use simple antennas which do not require accurate pointing. Given this requirement, a relatively low frequency is-attractive since the receiving cross sectionof a dipole antenna is proportional to the square oithe .wavelength(33) The limitations on the lower end of the spectrum are governed by noise background and spectrum availability Table 9-12.

The data demodulator used a phased lock loop to derive ship timing such that the proper pair of matched filters were sampled at the proper time. The total energy present in the three mark channels was compared with the total energy present in the three space channels for each bit time to decide if a \"Mark\" or \"Space\" had been sent.

See References 21, 32, and 39 through 42. A block diagram-of the transponder on LES-5 is shown in Figure 9-6 (39). The LES-6 transponder was basically the same as that shown for LES-5. Transponder fre­ quencies, powers and bandwidths. were different. Additionally, the beacon trans­ mitter served as the third input to the antenna triplexer instead of the telemetry trans­ mitter. The latter employed a separate- antenna for signal radiations. The characteristics of LES-3 are not summarizedAn Table 9-15 since it did not dontain a cominunications repeater. LES-3 was built to provide an orbiting UHF beacon to be used fot propagation measurements. It radiated 28.5 watts biphase modulated by a 15-bit pseudorandom sequence clocked at a rate of 100 kHz (11)(14) Such a signal permitted detailed measurdments of the multipath and fading character­ istics of the propagation medium. LES-3 was constructed utilizing the frame, power system, and power amplifiers designed for LES-1 and 2 and was similar in appearance. to these satellites(1)(19) The most apparent difference was alack of optical sensors and X-band antennas on the triangular faces and the presence, of a UHF. monolole- antenna projecting from the top and bottom rectangular surfaces of the spin stabilized satellite.

LES-5 provided, in addition to the features indicated in Table 9-15, a solar cell degradation experiment, an RF interference experiment, and experimental switching logic for antenna despinning although no actual antenna switching was performed (21 ) . The solar cell experiment included measurements on two 10-ohm em. silicon cells with 30-ril. cover slides, one 10-ohm cm. silicon cell with 6-nil. cover slide, and two CdS thin film cells(3 ). The satellite RFI receiver had a 120­ lCHz noise bandwidth and was designed to tune from.283 MHz to 253 MHz in 256 steps of approximately 120 KHz each, dwelling at each step for 2.56 seconds ( 4 3 ). The time for a complete frequency scan was approximately 11 minutes. In the fixed 9-33 frequency modes, the RFI instrument also functioned as the command receiver for the spacecraft. The onboard experimental switching logic was included to obtain data for the design of the despun antenna system flown on LES-6. LES-6 provided, in addition to the features indicated in Table 9-15, a solar cell degradation experiment, space radiation environment measurements, an earth albedo experiment, an RF interference experiment, precision spin period measurements, and a communications transmitter making highly efficient use of available dc power (2 1 ) .

The RFI experiment was very similar to that on LES-5 except it measured interference in the band from 290 to 315 MHz(4 3 ) .

The ECI terminal was an experimental, off-the-shelf, single channel, low data rate, teletype communication system that employedthe triple frequency diversity ECI modem. The U.S. Navy version of this t6rminal was nicknamed a LODUS terminal. The U. S. Air Force version was designated the UHF terminal (ECI 591). The U. S. Army's Project East equipment included two jeep, two 680-kg (3/4-ton) truck, and one 7.9-meter (26-foot) van terminal. They were assembled from off-the-shelf commer­ cial and military equipment and employed conventional frequency modulation for voice and teletype communicatifo'As.

With the experiene gaiiied from opeb}tinig these early terminals,, the U. S. Armed Services went on to develop terminals specially designed for operation in, a tactical military communications environment.

Each combination was excited in either of two­ phase relationships to produce two beam positions per pair of elements and a total of 16 switched overlapping beams in the array.

Pattern ripple due to beam switching was +0.5 dB Two antenna-switching logic systems were included on LESt6 which could be operated independently or in a combined mode (21). As on LES-4, one system measured the direction to the earth at one point in the orbit and predicted the orbital position of the satellite as a function of time while the second system determined earth direction during every revolution of the spinning satellite. In the bombined mode, the earth direction measuring system was employed during the hours of local daylight at the subsatellite point and the orbit storage system was used during the hours of local darkness. All modes of operation worked well- for the first week in orbit (2 9 ) . Subsequently a relay flip-flop failed in the Earth Position register of the orbit storage system causing inaccurate pointing in both that mode and the mixed mode. The earth direction measuring system continued to work as expected. As on LES-4, however, pointing became inaccurate between local sunset and sunrise as the satellite's optical sensors lost track of the exact location of the earth. Proper operation of LES-6's high efficiency RF transmitter from a varying dc power source was verified immediately after launch when it was discovered that one solar panel was not delivering the expected power. This failure produced a spin variation of about 1 volt in the solar bus voltage which resulted in about a 0. 5­ 2 9 ) dB spin variation in transmitted power . This variation was superimposed on the ripple due to beam switching.

They measured latitude, of the satellite-earth line, relative to the satellite's equatorial plane at points 900 apart in ( 2 1 ) (4 6) . the orbit, providing a good view of both the sunlit earth and the sun By positioning the measurements 90* apart, X and Y axes of correction were established. In making a limited number of measurements it was assumed that the satellite attitude did not change greatly between measuring points. Proper orbital measurements points were determined by the coincidence, of pulses from specially positioned earth and sun sensors. Knowledge of the satellite spin rate, as determined from sun sensor measurements, and X and-Y axis errors allowed corrections to be triggered at the appropriate points during every satellite rotation. The LES-5 attitude control system employed only magnetic torquing for corrections and operated correctly in spite of the failure of. one of its four sun sensors. The effect of the failure was to reduce the rate of attitude correction but (2 1 )not its overall accuracy . The system demonstrated a capability of keeping the spin axis within 2.60 of normal to the orbital plane (4 6 ) . iThe LES-6 system provided either magnetic or cold ammqnia gas.thruster corrective torquing and was designed (21)to maintain attitude within 0.16' when the gas thruster system wasemployed The LES-6 system could not be operated when.the satellite spin axis was found (immediately after launch) to be offset 2.20 from the axis of symmetry of the"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__209", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 209, "text": "provided either magnetic or cold ammqnia gas.thruster corrective torquing and was designed (21)to maintain attitude within 0.16' when the gas thruster system wasemployed The LES-6 system could not be operated when.the satellite spin axis was found (immediately after launch) to be offset 2.20 from the axis of symmetry of the cylinder. The automatic stationkeeping system on LES-6 used an accurate onboard clock to provide an indication of the time at which the satellite should arrive at a given point in its orbit (2 1 ) ( 2 8 ) . The time of actual arrival, as determined by the clock and the coincidence of sun and earth sensor observations, was compared with the desired time to generate longitude position errors to be corrected by firing thrusters as appropriate. Thrusters firings were-activated at satellite orbital points separated by 1800 in order to ensure that orbit eccentricity remained constant. Either cold ammonia gas thrusters or pulsed plasma.electric microthrusters, using solid Teflon as the propellant, could be employedfor corrections. 9-41 Both thruster systems .displayed proper and reliable operation although some intermittency of the pulsed plasma thrusters was. observed after they had fired for several thousand hours 4 7 ).

None of the difficulties reviewed significantly handicapped the communications test program. Results of UHF noise and interference measurements are given in Table 59-18( . As indicated by the table, receiver composite noise temperature measurements were taken on vehicular, shipborne, and airborne terminals while uplink UHF interference levels at a synchronous satellite were measured on LES-5 and LES­ 6. LES-5's RFI receiver experienced a timing problem which was hypothesized to be due to cross coupling from one of the onboard logic systems that operated on earth­ sun inputs. These inputs disappeared around local midnight at the subsatellite point as did the RFI receiver timing problem. As a result, all of the LES-5 RFI data was centered about local midnight. LES-6's data gave a 24-hour distribution of interference but since the satellite was stationary the information obtained was primarily applicable to the North and Sduth American continents alone. In addition to the measurements indicated in Table 9-18, tests of interference generated by the UHF tactical satellite communications terminals were conducted showing that potential conflicts do exist if adequate distances and frequency separations are not maintained.

In case of FM voice signal and frequency hopping signal, however, intermodulation added a noticeable amount of noise to FM signal. Attenuation due to atmospheric moisture may vary between 0.5 to 1. 5 dB dependent upon the atmospheric path traversed by the signal. Locally heavy precipitation can add several more dB of loss.

Fading occurs primarily for eleva­ tion angles between 0 & 200i Over water and ice cyclic fades vary between I & 10 dB with 5 dB being most common. Over land cyclic fades decrease to 2 to 3 dB with occasional random fades of 5 to 10 dB. Flights over mountains dis­ play no multipath.

'Production TATS modems also displayed poor operational reliability. The triple diversity modem displayed a significant degree of protection against multipath and, RFI as did the TATS modem. The TATS modem also supplied as in-band multiple access capability. Multiple access tests were successfully conducted employing narrowband FM voice, triple diversity teletype, TATS 2400 bps, and TATS teletype separately and in mixed modes (33). Up to 17 TATS 2400 bps accesses through LES-6 into a C-135 aircraft terminal were demonstrated to be feasible (5 0 ). However, TATS, as designed with its short period frequency hopping pattern (i. e., it repeats every 7 symbols) suffered from considerable interference due to related address codes. With even as few as two common frequencies between two hopping patterns the cross correlation was sufficiently high to make false acquisitions so prevalent that acquiring the proper signal was almost impossible. Therefore, the hopping patterns present in a multiple access environment had to be severly constrained. These restrictions, in some cases, limited the number of premissible users below that theoretically indicated by consideration of available power and'bandwidth alone. Table 9-20.

Fiked wing aircraft experiments included-evaluations, of crossed, slot, crossed, dipole, and blade antennas (33). The crossed slot antenna supplied relatively'godd hemispherical coverage with antenna gain for the-circularly -polarized antenna avarying between -1 dB and +5 dB. The crossed dipole and blade antennas provided complementary' patterns. with the former displaying good, gain. at elevation angles above 300 to 400 while the latter supplied its peak gain at elevation angles below 300 to 400 The crossed dipole supplied circularly polarized signals and the blade linearly polarized signals. The complementary patterns indicated that these two antennas should be* employed in a combined' system having a switching capability for selecting the appropriate antenna.. Helicopter, antenna tests included evaluations of'crossed dipole- and blade antennas individually and in,variouscombihations mounted, above and below the rotor (36). As,i the, case of the fixed'wing aircraft tests, results indicated that a crossed dipole and blade antenna. should, be-employed in combination. Ldcating it above, the rotor avoided rotor blade modulation caused primarily by blockage of the antenna aperature. 9.3.6.

Operational Results These were not operational spacecraft; therefore, no operational traffic was carried. The experimental tactical ground, terminals operated' essentially as expected. One difficulty was that production models of the TATS modem displayed poor reliability. The satellites also operated, generally, as expected in spite of a number of minor difficulties, most of which were described, in the discussion of \"Experiments\" in Section 9.3. 5. Problems previously discussed' on,LES-5 included the sun sensor failure affecting the automatic attitude control system, the high rate timing signal to the RFI and command receiver, the 11-dB degradation in communications receiver- sensitivity, and the sudden shift in transponder frequency translation. Additional LES-5 9-47 difficulties included intermodulation between the telemetry and commuincations transmitters, an open circuit in one series-connected string on a solar panel, and higher than expected first year degradation of the solar array (i. e., about 22%), The intermodulation was a result of the two signals using the same antenna and was generated in spring finger contacts used at the.edges of the slot antenna cavities behind the solar panels. This -problem disappeared after the satellite had been in orbit a few months. The solar array.power difficulties did not interfere with LES-5 testing. Problems previously discussed on'LES-6 included spinning about an axis 2.20 offset from the axis of symmetry of the csrliiader, one solar panel delivering a low power output, a flip flop failure in an Earth Position register of the antenna switching logic, and interference to the radiation environment experiment by radiating communications antenna elements. Additional LES-6 difficulties included intermodu­ lation between the beacon and communications transmitters and the shutter, covering the radiation experiment, operating intermittently.

Since that time, the organization has expanded to include 85 member nations (as of May 1974). The interim agreements establishing the organitgtion in1264 provided for two management organs. An Interim Committee on Satellite Communications (ICSC), made up of member na­ tions, served as a policy board, and the U. P, Communications SatelliteCorporation (COMSAT) was responsible for system operation and technical management. In this arrangement, COMSAT was also the U.S. representative on the ICSC and under voting weighted according to system ownership was the predominant voice in establishing initial INTELSAT policies. During negotiations initiated in 1969 and concluded on May 20, 1970, the interim agreements were superseded by permanent definitive international arrangements that will become effective in about 1978. The reorganizqtion required by the new agree­ ments will be phased over a 6-year period. The periodbegan in February 1973, when all member nations ratified the new agreements. During the 6-year phase-over period, a Board of Governors, composed of 20 to 25 members voting according to ownership percentage, will replace the ICSC. No single member will control more than one-half the votes on this board, The Board of Governors will receive top level political guidance from an Assembly of Parties, con­ sisting of representatives of all member states, which meet at least once every 2 years. The Board will be guided on system operational matters by a Meeting of Signatories, consisting of the telecommunications representatives of all member states.

I, was initiated by- COMSAT in November 1963. Just- a year earlier,-inAugust -1962, theU4 S. Congress had passed the Communications,Satellite Ao.t; which authorized the creation of a pri­ vate corporation (COMSAT) to instigate the development of a global commercial 'com­ munications satellite system.' At the -timeswhen Early Bird's development began, the SYNCOM II satellite had just -completed demonstrating -that. reliable communicatipns could be provided through lightweight synchronous satellites. As a result, the SYNCOM satellite design formed the basis for the Early Bird spacecraft. Early Bird was launched in early 1965, as indicated in Table 10-1, and by April 22, 1965, had successfully achieved synchronization into the desired geostationary orbit with the satellite located over the Atlantic Ocean.

It was\" reactivated for a brief period lateri i 1969 whext temporary difficulties were encountered with the antdnna systemr of a third'generation INTELSAT satellite. The second generation of INTELSAT spacecraft was designated INTELSAT 11. Even when the INTELSAT I system was under development, it was realized that many of the inherent advantages of space communications could not be exploited. Specifi­ cally, its antenna characteristics were such as to embrace only the northeastern part of North America and the western part of Europe, and it did not allow for simultaneous 10-2. Table 10-i.

In the past, these circuits had been carried by HF radio, but for manned space flights, improved communications were desired. Consequently, in the fall of 1965 the development for INTELSAT 11 hadbegun with-the primary goal of satisfying the NASA requirements; excess capacity was to be used for other commercial traffic. Because of the urgency to satisfy the NASA requirement, the INTELSAT II design evolved directly from that of INTELSAT I. Four INTELSAT H satellites were produced and launched as indicated in - Table 10-2. The first launch occurred 'inOctober 1966; 'but when the satellite's apogee motor malfunctioned, the spacecraft was left in a highly elliptical inclined orbit, making it unusable for full-time commercial operations. Subsequent launches in January and September 1967 successfully placed two satellites into operational serv­ ice over the Pacific Ocean. A March 1967 launch successfully supplemented the INTELSAT I satellite in operation over the Atlantic Ocean. With these three satel­ lites in place, commercial service was available over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The INTELSAT H satellites continued to meet international commercial com­ munications requirements successfully until third generation replacement satellites allowed them to be retired to the active reserve. The development of INTELSAT III was initiated in 1964 with a design study and followed 2 years later with the award of a contract for the de'sign, development, and fabrication of the necessary spacecraft.

The antenna problem was resolved by August 1, 1969, and commercial operations were resumed until a subsequent January 1970 INTELSAT II launch allowed the satellite to be placed in the retired reserve. In April 1970, another successful -INTELSAT III launch supplemented the operational capability available over the Atlantic. An INTELSAT III satellite was first placed into operation over the Pacific in February 1969. This satellite was supplemented by a second spacecraft in May 1969. When the first Pacific INTELSAT III lost 6 dB of transponder gain due to an RF re­ ceive amplifier malfunction, it was relocated over the Indian Ocean where the traffic requirements were lighter. As a result, four INTELSAT HI satellites were, as of May 1971, providing global commercial service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Development of the fourth generation of INTELSAT spacecraft, INTELSAV IV, began in the latter portion of the 1960s. These satellites, manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company, have been designed to provide a substantially greater capability to meet the increased global communication needs of the 1970s.

Subsequent INTELSAT IVs were launched for service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans with an additional two satellites as spares in or­ bit. Each satellite has a life expectancy of about 7 years. Table 10-4 summarizes the INTELSAT IV launchings up to June 1974. Two INTELSAT IV satellites are therefore operational over the Atlantic. One of these, as the \"primary path, \"handles one-half of the traffic between large users plus all of the traffic to, from, and betweei the smaller users. The other satellite operates in a \"major path\" mode to carry the remaining half of the traffic between large users, thus providing route diversity.

Two additional INTELSAT IV launches are planned, one each for the-Pacific and the Indian Ocean, to provide for additional back-up. Because of the need to provide for rapidly increasing traffic as well as better utilization of both hardware and the spectrum, yet another generation of spacecraft will be required in the near future. However, this 'time a number of more extensive changes in technology will be needed. A rigid requirement for INTELSAT is continuity of service; therefore, any uncertainty requires extensive testihg under actual opera­ tional conditions. The changes involve, principally, the introduction of operations into the recently allocated 11/14 GHz portion of the spectrum.

Questions as t6 the extent of the propagation risk involved and how fast to introduce the service are key to the decision on when and how to proceed. In addition there is a question of the pro­ vision of an L-band transponder to provide for maintenance services. These deci­ sions are not expected to be available from the INTELSAT Board of Governors until late 1974; therefore, half of, a generation of spacecraft known as INTELSAT IVA has been developed. INTELSAT IVA will meet the requirements for traffic growth without requiring the extension of technology change demanded by INTELSAT V. INTELSAT IVA is planned for deployment in the Atlantic basin in late 1975. It is an INTELSAT IV with a communications payload that will provide almost twice. the traffic capacity of INTELSAT IV. Whereas INTELSAT IV is a 12 transponder satellite, INTELSAT IVA will use new technology in RF filters, TWTs and antennas to provide 20 transponders. This is done by reserving the allocated 500-MHz frequency allocation at 6 GHz (uplink) and at 4 GHz (downlink). A unique antenna design produces beams which will cover the Atlantic basin earth stations with side lobes sufficiently suppressed to provide a mini­ mum of 27 dB of discrimination between the co-frequency transmissions on the east and west beams. Actually this design would permit the total reuse of the spectrum so that, in principle, IVA could provide 24 transponders of 40 MHz each compared with V's 12.

This is accom­ plished by the changes indicated in Table 10-5. The INTELSAT program hasbeen a commercial. venture and the number of major innovations in the equipment and techniques pployed has been limited to those required to provide a reliable service. The intent has been to minimize the risk of spacecraft failure, and the exceptional reliability.record amassed by the system testifies to the success of this policy.- Nevertheless, the INTELSAT program has made significant contributions to satellite communications.. Numerous subjective tests with INTELSAT I demonstrated conclusively that the round trip time delay and echo dud totwo-wire user'teminations were-not insur­ mountable-obstacles to the utilization of synchtonous satellites for commercial com­ munications. This was in confirmation of preliminary indications obtained on Project SYNCOM. The 'INTELSAT II spacecraft- demonstrated'that tunnel diode amplifiers of op­ erational reliability were suitable for use as RF receive'preamplifiers. Utilizing these relatively low-noise, high-gain preamplifiers, allowed direct lF to -RF conver- - sion in a single stage to be employed.

These ter­ minals employed newly developed 500-MHz bandwidth cooled parametric amplifiers, as well as 500-MHz bandwidth high power traveling-wave tube transmitters, capable of over 6 kW of multicarrier power. The INTELSAT IV spacecraft have advanced satellite communications technology by demonstrating the feasibility of fixed narrow beamwidth (i.e., 4. 5 ) antennas mounted on a mechanically despun platform and a highly channelized satellite repeater (i. e., 12 independent transponders). The narrow-beam antennas provide coverage to a fixed, relatively restricted arda'of th earti with high antenna gain significantly in­ creasing satellite EIP. The 12 transponders, each having a 36-MHz bandwidth, allow users with substantially different communication requirements to operate inde­ pendently of each other in separate satellite channels (e. g., television distribution in one channel, high-capacity telephone trunks in another, 'and ilow-duty cycle individual voice links in still another).

A iflly Variable, demand-access, SPAD-'s~tem was -demonstrated for the first time when the INTELSAT IV satellites were placed into operational service. As-implied SPADE is'a demand assignment muiltiple access system. The de­ mand assignment feature is an effective method for increasing network capacity, and telephone companies have used the concept for many years. Thus, 800 satellite channels can be made to service from 2400 to 3200 individual user trunks on a de­ mand basis. The key to this capability -ofallowing earth stations to operate on the carrier to.provide the required channel to two user trunks, is a SPADE channel unit frequency synthesizer. This module is capable of generating any one of 800 carrier frequencies (at IF) on command from a computer or other remote calling source. Thus, when a call is being established, the channel unit is instructed to operate on the allocated frequency. The digitized voice then modulates (quadraphase PSK) that carrier and is translated to 6 GHz together with all other operating channel unit out­ puts. 10-12 With the SPADE operation voice channels are carried at 64 kbps with a bit error . rate of 1 x 10-4This rate is unacceptable for wideband digital data.

A Canadian station at Mill Village, Nova Scotia, also served as the North American terminal about 1 day per week after late 1966. In addition, it carried Early Bird traffic during the INTELSAT II launches to release the Andover station for launch sup­ port operations. Three of the European stations, located at Goonhilly Downs (England), Pleumeur Bodou (France), and Raisting (Germany), served alternately in the roles of operating station and standby. They were interconnected by terrestrial and submarine cable links that permitted all European traffic'to be carried by any one of the stations. The fourth smaller participating European terminal, located at Fucino (Italy), acted as a terminal for weekend traffic. It was linked to the other three terminals via Frankfrt, Germany. The terminals participating in Early Bird operations are sum­ marized in Table 10-6. The development of INTELSAT II with a bandwidth several times that of Early Bird was accompanied by second generation earth station designs such as those for the Brewster Flats, Washington, and Paumalu, Hawaii, installations.

Their existence did, however, provide experience in working with a variety of stations with a wide range of sensitivities. System planning for the INTELSAT III satellite was completed in 1967, and,a third generation of earth stations was designed to provide full operating capability with these spacecraft. Of paramount importance to the INTELSAT III satellite design was the use of two transponders covering nearly the entire 500-MHz band assigned to communications satellite service. The new earth station designs made this entire band available for use so that carrier frequencies could be assigned without regard for narrow-band equipment. This flexibility guaranteed the success of multidestina­ tion FM-FDM to provide complete satellite multiple access to all earth stations in the network. A complete list of terminals participating in operations with INTELSAT III satellites, as of January 1971, together with present operating status, is provided in Table 10-6. Multiple access communications nets have been formed among appropriate groups of these terminals to operate with INTELSAT satellites located over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Fourth generation earth terminals have been constructed to operate with the new INTELSAT IV satellites. These terminals provide a large number of carriers to take advantage of the multiplicity of satellite transponders that have become available. As a result, the requirements for linearity in common RFtransmitting and receiving elements within these ground terminals have been substantially increased.

In IVA the frequencies are reused to increase the capability effectively to 20 independent repeaters as previously explained. Uplink frequencies for each repeater are 2225 MHz above the indicated downlink frequency. The fre­ quencies employed were selected to be compatible with the frequency bands reserved for commercial satellite communications use on a shared basis in 1963. These fre­ quencies were set aside in response to recommendations originated by AT&T during the Telestar program. With the extensive ground complex and comparatively limited number of space­ craft involved in the INTELSAT program, satellite multiple-access techniques and RF modulation employed have been of vital importance to the system. INTELSAT I incorporated a multiple-access capability, in a sense, by virtue of its sharing a single TWT between two independent frequency-translating transponders. Since each of these transponders was hardlimiting in nature, the number of carriers accessing each was limited to one. For this reason, the mode of communication was point-to­ point, and only one duplex link between the United States and Europe was provided. Conventional voice-channel multiplex equipment similar to that employed in the Bell System and frequency modulation of the radiated carriers were employed. This sys­ tem configuration, in conjunction with the ground terminals available, provided INTELSAT I with a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity.

To ensure compliance with these criteria, carrier control stations were established at Paumalu, Hawaii, and Andover, Maine, whereby the Atlantic and Pacific INTELSAT H systems could be monitbred, each from a single point. In early operations with INTELSAT II satellites, FM carriers centered at specific frequencies were preassigned to individual links between two points, thereby- retaining the point­ to-point mode of operation employed on INTELSAT I. However, multiple point-to­ point links were established through the INTELSAT 11 transponders.

The system configuration described, together with the second generation ground complex, pro­ duced a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity foreach INTELSAT II satellite. It was recognized, by the time the INTELSAT I satellites started to be put into service, that the satellite capacity could be increased and the system complexity re­ duced by switching to a point-to-multipoint mode of multiple-access operation. This was implemented by designing each terminal to transmit one preassigned multides­ tination FM carrier containing channels intended for all users to which it was linked. Baseband channels were preallocated to a particular user as part of a given network plan and were stripped off at each respective receiving site. The INTELSAT III satellite transponders were again designed for quasi-linear operation, and the same type of carrier control concept as utilized for the INTELSAT II system was employed. The described mode of system operation allowed the third generation earth terminals to realize a 1200-duplex voice-channel system capacity when operating through an INTELSAT Ill satellite. Alternately, the satellites could provide four television channels. The INTELSAT III approach to modulation, multiple access and system control was continued as the INTELSAT IV satellites were introduced to the system. However, it was supplemented, at an early date, by a full variable demand-access system called SPADE, which operates in a separate transponder of the INTELSAT IV satellite. The 10-25 SPADE system features PCM encoding of individual voice channels for quadriphase PSK modulation of a carrier. It includes the ability to deactivate carrier transmis­ sion to the satellite during periods of talker inactivity and a decentralized control concept allowing self-assignment of available satellite channels.

It includes the ability to deactivate carrier transmis­ sion to the satellite during periods of talker inactivity and a decentralized control concept allowing self-assignment of available satellite channels. The SPADE system has been assigned to transponder 10 of INTELSAT IV satellites. This particular transponder does not have access to the spot beam antennas. SPADE is compatible with standard manual or automatic international signaling and switching systems. User applications, where the satellite channel requirements vary widely over the period of a day, find SPADE quite attractive. Each of the INTELSAT IV transponders, in conjunction with the earth coverage satellite antennas and the fourth generation ground complex, provides about 600 fall duplex voice channels when FDMA-FM is employed, 800 full duplex voice channels when SPADE is used, or 1 FM color televi­ sion channel, including the TV audio. Planning for the INTELSAT IVA system is more complex than IV because of transmission constraints resulting from frequency reuse techniques. For IVA there are two possible up-link modes: hemispheric (East and West) and global. The down-link has three modes: hemispheric (East and West), spot (NW, NE, SW, and SE), and global. In order to provide such services as SPADE, TDMA, TV, and telephony to earth stations outside the normal hemispheric cbverage zones, four transponders have been designated as global beam channels in IVA. With some con­ straints, the remaining 8 co-transponder pairs (10 transponders) can be switched to either a hemispheric or spot beam on the down-link. That is, of the potential 1,000 MHz bandwidth mode available by frequency reuse techniques, 160 MHz (four 40 MHz transponders) will be lost in order to provide unique services on a global scale.

Within these bounds, the 20-transponder INTELSAT IVA is expected to be con­ figured to handle 12,500 voice grade channels (plus one TV and one SPADE transponder) for a typical Atlantic Primary Satellite frequency plan configuration. 10-26 In comparison an INTELSAT IV Atlantic Primary Satellite can be configured for 7,500 channels (plus one TV and one SPADE transponder). Therefore the net in­ crease for IVA over IV is about 5,000 chanels. 10.3 SPACECRAFT The Early Bird satellite was very similar to the Syncom III spacecraft. Early Bird's microwave repeater consisted of two independent nonlinear, hard-limiting, frequency translating transponders. Both transponders shared a single TWT output power amplifier. A second TWT was carried on-board the spacecraft for redundancy; however, only one of the tubes was on at a time. A block diagram of the Early Bird repeater is provided in Figure 10-1. The satellite was spin-stabilized for attitude control and the elimination of temperature extremes. The pancake-shaped antenna pattern was squinted to provide high gain coverage of the northern hemisphere alone. Spacecraft design lifetime was only 18 months. However, Early Bird operated suc­ cessfully for more than 3 years until it was retired from service. Communications characteristics of this satellite are provided in Table 10-13. The INTELSAT IIsatellite design evolved directly from that of Early Bird. Among the most significant changes were the adoptidn of a single redundant wideband linear amplifier and an antenna beam that covered both the northern and southern hemispheres. The transponder bandwidth was 125 MHz compared with the two re­ peaters of 25-MHz bandwidth, each used"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__251", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 251, "text": "directly from that of Early Bird.

The transponder bandwidth was 125 MHz compared with the two re­ peaters of 25-MHz bandwidth, each used in Early Bird. A block diagram of the INTELSAT 11 satellite's communications system is shown in Figure 10-2. To main­ tain the 240-circuit capacity of Early Bird, in spite of the wider antenna beamwidth, INTELSAT II employed multiple traveling-wave tubes operating in parallel. Four tubes were included in anticipation that three would be required to meet the EIRP re­ quirements, leaving one tube as a spare. However, the antenna and power efficiencies achieved were such that a two-tube configuration was adequate. The additional power required by INTELSAT H was provided by using a larger solar cell array.

Communications System Block Diagram for INTELSAT II 0 eclipse periods occasionally experienced in the synchronous orbit. The communica­ tion characteristics of'INTELSAT II are sh6wn in Table 10-14. Because the communications subsystem of the INTELSAT III satellites provided for two independent transponders, these spacecraft more closely resemble INTELSAT I than INTELSAT II. The most significant difference between the INTELSAT I and INTELSAT Ill transponders is that whereas the former was a hard-limiting, non­ linear, double-conversion repeater, the latter is a linear, single-conversion repeater. This is in agreement with the INTELSAT II design. The INTELSAT III transponder has a bandwidth of 225 MHz. Together two transponders cover most of the 500-MHz bandwidth allocated to the communication satellite service in the 4,-GHz and 6-GHz bands. The initial satellites in the INTELSAT IH series employed single tunnel-diode amplifiers in the receiver. However, after satellite F-3 lost 6 dB of transponder gain due to a malfunction in one stage of the tunnel-diode amplifier, ill subsequent spacecraft were provided with redundant receive amplifiers t6 enhance the overall subsystem reliability. A block diagram of the satellite communications subsystem is provided in Figure 10-3. Communications characteristics of the satellite are sum­ marized in Table 10-15. A further important distinction between INTELSAT I and INTELSAT III appears in the communication antennas. The antennas of INTELSAT I were symmetrical about the spin axis to maintain constant antenna gain. INTELSAT III employes a mechanically despun antenna. This mechanically despun antenna is the most important innovation in this series of satellites, and perhaps the most critical.

When the spot beams of this satellite are employed witlh high performance ground terminals, a bandwidth limited system results. The INTELSAT IV satellites' communications subsystem consists of global receive and both global and spot beam transmit antennas connected to a 12-channel repeater that provides high power ampli­ fication for each channel individually. Each of these 12 channels ,has a bandwidth approaching 40 MHz, thereby providing capacity for about 500 communications circuits. The satellite has the capability, using the EC antenna, for relaying 6000 half duplex telephone calls, or 12 color television programs, or any equivalent combination of such transmissions. The communication systern of INTELSAT IV is depicted in the block diagram of Figure 10-4. Communications characteristics of the satellite are summarized in Table 10-16. The spot beam transmit antennas represent the most significant departure from the previous satellite designs of the INTELSAT series. Two of these antennas, each a parabolic disc of 127-cm (50-inch) diameter, are mounted on the despun control mast of the satellite. The entire RF portion of the spacecraft is despun. Pointing of the spot beams is prefixed on the ground. These high gain antennas with beamwidths of about 4 degrees, can be used to provide spot coverage in Europe and North and South America, or they can be employed to provide intracontinental coverage within specific countries. The basic physical configuration of the INTELSAT IV spacecraft is depicted in Figure 10-5.

The participating terminals were listed in Table 10-6. The Andover earth station, originally built for Telstar, was modified during the period July 1964 through March 1965. The Goonhilly Downs earth station, also an original Telstar terminal, was withdrawn from service in September 1964 for modification to work with Early Bird. Prior to modification, the performance of Goonhilly was about 3 dB down as compared to Andover and Pleumeur Bodou.

Prior to modification, the performance of Goonhilly was about 3 dB down as compared to Andover and Pleumeur Bodou. The modification improved the terminal's performance by reducing profile inaccuracies of the reflector, reducing aperture blocking frotm the feed support structure, and reducing feeder losses. Character­ istics of the Andover, Goonhilly, and Raisting earth terminals, as configured for op­ eration with Early Bird, were as.indicated in Table 10-18. Second generation earth terminals were developed to take advantage of the wider bandwidths of the INTELSAT ITsatellites. These earth stations employed more ad­ vanced equipment than had previously been available, including solid-state designs, masers of wider bandwidth, Cassegrain feed antenna systems, and dual carrier re­ ceiving chains. A technical summary of three typical second generation earth stations that participated in operations with INTELSAT H satellites is given in Table 10-19. The original INTELSAT I terminals were also used to operate in the INTELSAT H sys­ tem. These terminals were not significantly modified from their Early Bird configu­ rations. In building the third generation stations for operation with INTELSAT II, new 500-MHz bandwidth cooled parametric amplifiers were developed, as well as 500-MHz 10-41 COMMUNICATION FILTERS/ANTENNACOMMUNICATION ELECTRONICS POWER SUBSYSTEM' DESPIN SUBSYSTEM PROPULSION SUBSYSTEM TELEMETRY AND COMMAND STRUCTURE WIRE HARNESS APOGEE MOTOR BOOSTER/SPACECRAFT INTERFACE Figure 10-7.

Antenna sizes become relatively standardized at 97 feet diameter, partly to compensate for the somewhat higher noise temperatures resulting from the wideband feed systems, and partly to obtain a small performance marginfor the ter­ restrial stations. The characteristics for two third generation earth stations, Paumalu (Hawaii) and Fucino (Italy), are presented in Table 10-20. With both global and spot beam transponders, INTELSAT IV allows earth sta­ tions to operate with a large number of carriers.

The result is that intermodulation distortion becomes an increasingly important consideration in earth station perform­ ance. The higher capacities associated with INTELSAT IV require existing earth .stations to verify a greater linear deviation capability, evaluate their threshold ex­ tension demodulator performance at the larger capacities, augment existing group de­ lay equalization to the larger bandwidths associated with higher capacities, and replace certain traffic bearing and monitoring filters whose bandwidths are related to channel capacity. With the fourth generation of earth stations, new and upgraded terminals, an approach to a \"standard\" earth station has been achieved. Such stations have typical minimum characteristics as shown in Table 10-21. In general, they are required to provide a receive gain of at least 57 dB and a receive G/T of 40.7 dB/ 0 K. Both the transmit and receive chains provide a 500-MHz RF bandwidth. Terminal transmit­ ting feeds are left-hand circularly polarized and receive feeds right-hand circularly polarized. Each terminal, as a minimum, contains both an autotrack and manual tracking capability. Other mandatory performance characteristics of earth stations in the INTELSAT IV system are shown in Table 10-22. The existing, under construction, and planned earth stations are listed in Tables 10-6 through 10-11, and are standard, unless otherwise noted. As of the end of March 1974, 89 earth station antennas were tracking and communicating with INTELSAT IV satellites. By the end of 1974, 107 earth station antennas are expected to be in service.

In spite of this, a number of experimental activities of major significance have taken place and indications are that this typeof activity will acceler­ ate in the future. An example of past activities is the Early Bird tests to evaluate the subjective effects of long transmission delay on telephone subscribers and techniques for re­ ducing echo caused by two wire user terminations to acceptable levels. Although the feasibility of synchronous satellite communications had been successfully demon­ strated in the Syncom program, conclusive results in the two areas indicated had not been obtained. Furthermore, prior to Early Bird, the operational experience re­ quired for a reliable commercial system was not available. The successful opera­ tion of Early Bird (INTELSAT I), for more than 3 years; demonstrated public acceptance of space communications. Inso doing, it proved conclusively that, for single synchronous earth satellite repeaters, transmission delay and echo were not serious problems in the realization of an operational commercial system. Earth sta­ tion experience gained at Andover, Goonhilly Downs, Pleumeur Bodou, and Funico demonstrated that efficient reliable communications could be maintained and heralded the introduction of multistation operations.

Earth sta­ tion experience gained at Andover, Goonhilly Downs, Pleumeur Bodou, and Funico demonstrated that efficient reliable communications could be maintained and heralded the introduction of multistation operations. Another area of major experimental interest to INTELSAT has been modulation techniques for multiple access of a single satellite transponder. An important inherent 10-49 advantage of communications via satellite is that a large number of widely separated earth stations can communicate with each other simultaneously through the same satellite. Through multiple access, the potential exists to greatly increase system flexibility and to reduce the size and equipment complexity of the space subsystem. As a result, techniques for multiple access have received a great deal of attention for both military and commercial applications. At the time of Early Bird, frequency modulation and frequency-division multiple­ access (FDMA) were the common approaches to RF modulation and multiple access. Both were favored because of their compatibility with existing hardware. It was also desirable at that time, due to limitations on realizable satellite power and weight in orbit, to operate spacecraft repeaters as hard limiting transponders. This approach to repeater design provided maximum efficiency in converting primary dc power into radiated RF power. However, the nonlinear transfer function of hard limiting trans­ ponders results in intermodulation among the various independent carriers existing in an FDMA system and thereby limits the potential system capacity somewhat. A means of avoiding the nonlinear repeater problem is to operate with only one carrier through the satellite transponder at any one time. This can be accomplished by having the earth stations transmit their information in bursts rather than continu­ ously as in FDMA, and by synchronizing these bursts so that they"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__268", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 268, "text": "of avoiding the nonlinear repeater problem is to operate with only one carrier through the satellite transponder at any one time. This can be accomplished by having the earth stations transmit their information in bursts rather than continu­ ously as in FDMA, and by synchronizing these bursts so that they enter the transponder in a nonoverlapping sequence. Such a system is called time-division multiple-access (TDMA). INTELSAT's interest in TDMA started in the early stages of commercial satellite communications in 1964, and in 1965 work was initiated on the MATE pro­ gram. This 3-terminal system operated at 6 Mbps and had a preassigned capacity of 72 channels. The field testing of MATE, the first TDMA system to be so tested, was conducted via INTELSAT I in August 1966. The tests clearly demonstrated the feasibility of TDMA and indicated that burst synchronization to accuracies in the low nanosecond region could be achieved if such accuracy were required. Both the initial FDMA and TDMA systems employed fixed preassigned allocations of satellite transponder time, frequency, and power. Unfortunately, the preassigned 10-50 approaches to multiple access, while providing excellent quality and service, have a poor working flexibility and use satellite spectrum and power inefficiently by provid­ ing a poor \"fill factor. \" Fill factor can be viewed as the relationship of the total voice channel capacity of a satellite transponder to the average number of such channels actively employed during the busy period. When fixed assignments are made, there are numerous instances where channels stand inactive. Recognizing the need for more efficient systems, INTELSAT began to consider demand access approaches to multiple utilization of the same satellite transponder. In demand access, the general concept is to assign nonoverlapping allocations of satellite power and thne-frequency spectrum to users, in real time, as their demand for service"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__269", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 269, "text": "inactive.

In demand access, the general concept is to assign nonoverlapping allocations of satellite power and thne-frequency spectrum to users, in real time, as their demand for service occurs. Both TDMA and FDMA systems providing demand-access service are theoretically feasible. The SPADE system is an FDMA demand-access system given extensive consid­ eration by INTELSAT. SPADE has been designed for links ranging from fractional requirements to 12 and 24 channels and is a PCM-PSK-FDMA system. The develop­ ment of SPADE was begun in 1964. The salient features of the SPADE system include digital PCM encoding of voice on a single channel per carrier, the ability to transmit to the satellite only during talker activity, quadriphase PSK modulation, system self­ assignment of channels, and operation with standard manual or automatic international signaling and switching systems. The ability to deactivate earth terminal transmis­ sions during periods of talker inactivity tends to compensate for having to operate satellite transponders in a backed-off mode such that linear transfer functions are provided. The system is compatible with the INTELSAT II, III, and IV satellites. It was tested between Andover, Maine, and Cayey, Puerto Rico, over INTELSAT II; and later between Etam, West Virginia, and Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, over INTELSAT flI. The SPADE system is now operational and has been assigned to trans­ ponder 10 of the INTELSAT IV in the Atlantic region, and is serving 12 accesses. It is anticipated that by 1976 as many as 40 stations will be using SPADE.

Following the MATE system success, INTELSAT started planning for the next generation of TDMA systems, with emphasis on extending the state-of-the-art in all 10-51 technological areas relating to TDMA. The resulting experimental system, called MAT-1, is a PCM-PSK-TDMA system for 12 to 24 channel links. It is based upon a 50-Mbps transmission rate that yields over 700 8-bit PCM channels in a 10-station network configuration. A unique feature of this system is its orientation toward de­ mand assignment. The Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) Research Laboratory has developed a 50-Mbps TDMA system, called TTT, which has time-assigned traffic blocks, including a block devoted to an experimental pulse-code modulation, time-assignment speech interpola­ tion (PCM-TASI) design. The MAT-i and the TTT systems are compatible; field tests of these terminals were conducted in July 1970, over INTELSAT III (F-4) among stations in Hawaii, Japan, Australia. Another technique being actively developed is that of placing a time-division switching capability on-board the satellite itself. This technique will become partic­ ularly attractive as satellites providing multiple spot beams come into use. In this technique, known as Satellite-Switched Multiple Access, all stations' transmissions are frame-synchronized by destination as they enter their respective satellite re­ ceivers. Following amplification and, perhaps, down conversion, these signals enter the satellite distribution subsystem that acts as a time-division switch. In this switch, all the traffic intended for a particular destination is sequeitially directed toward. the output amplifier and antenna for that destination.

Still another area of major concern to the INTELSAT program has been link pro­ pagation. Considerable detailed data on satellite link propagation characteristics at the 4-and 6-Hz frequencies has been obtained. This includes items such as atmos­ pheric absorption as a function of weather conditions; scintillation and faraday r6tation as functions of time, geographic location, and sunspot activity; and maultipath as a function of antenna elevation angle. As the geostationary orbit has tended to fill up with satellites operating at 4 and 6 GHz, INTELSAT has become interested in link 10-52 propagation characteristics for spacecraft communications systems operating at fre­ quencies above 10 GHz. This interest is evidenced in the Cofrsat propagation-experi­ ment to be conducted at 13 and 18 GHz by NASA's ATS-6 satellite. This experiment is designed to gather data on satellite signal attenuation at 13 and 18 GHz caused by atmospheric hydrometeors at ground stations located in representative climatological areas. The data obtained from this experiment will provide the basis. for establishing minimum power margins needed for operation at 13 and 18 GHz. 10. 6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Since the INTELSAT program has produced a commercial communications sys­ tem, the system's operational results obtained during each of the four generations of the space subsystem are of considerable interest., Early Bird was launched on April 6, 1965, and by April 22 it was sufficiently synchronized for the commence­ ment of communications testing.

Two groups of tesis were conducted concomitantly: the Performance Test Plan to determine how well the spacecraft performance in orbit met contract specifications, and the Experimental, Test Plan to deternfine system parameters when the spacecraft is used with the'opeiating ground ,stations. The Per­ formance Test Plan was c6mpleted in four days and included measurement of the spacecraft's-effective isotropic radiated-power (EIRP), receiving sensitivity; trans­ ponder gain and frequency response, noise power ratios (NPR), intelligible crosstalk, antenna patterns, polarization, and insensitivity of the command system to interference. The only notable failing of the Performance Test Plan was that the specification for intelligible crosstalk of -45 dB could not be met with TWT No. 1. For this reason, TWT No.. 2 was used for all commercial operations. The Experimental Plan tests were conducted for 18 hours per day for aweek. System characteristics with a variety of loading conditions were measured for all stations. It was'determined that the 240 circuit capadity could be realized by the four high-capacity stations and that a 6-dB margin existed in fair weather. It was also , determined that the antenna gain and receiving sensitivity for the four large stations were similar to within 1 dB. 10-53 Tests on system characteristics for monochrome TV were performed until all stations reached agreement on the optimum operating parameters. Three weeks after launch, the spacecraft and the earth stations were properly tested, and the space segment of the system was ready for use. The terrestrial net­ work operators then began circuit lineup.

S. and in the four countries in Europe.

For the 120-channel multiplex system to be used for the first commercial service, it was necessary to allow 4 weeks for ad­ justments at a circuit level both in the U. S. and in the four countries in Europe. These tests were completed on schedule, and the system was ready for operation in June. After a series of successful demonstrations with telephone circuits and tele­ vision service, commercial operation was initiated on June 28, 1965. Figure 10-8 summarizes commercial usage for telephone and television traffic through November 1967. The satellite contribution to out-of-service time was zero in the Early Bird system. All loss of service was attributable to the seven major earth segment elements--the five earth stations and the U.S. and European interconnects. The re­ liability history of this service through early 1967 is shown in Figure 10-9 in terms of cumulative percentage outage time. Early Bird was placed in retired reserve on January 20, 1969, after INTELSAT III achieved operational status. It was reactivated for a brief period between June 1969 and August 1969 when temporary difficulties were encountered with the despun antenna of an INTELSAT III satellite. The operational lifetime of 3-1/2 years far exceeded the design lifetime of 1-1/2 years for this ex­ ceptionally successful satellite program. The first INTELSAT II satellite (F-i) was launched in October 1966. Although it failed to achieve stationary orbit, the successful functioning of the communications subsystem permitted an 8-hour-per-day voice service to be established between the earth stations in Hawaii and Brewster Flat.

INTELSAT H satellites (F-2 and F-4) were employed for service in the Pacific area. During the time when the F-4 satellite was undergoing final positioning maneu­ vers, its longitude was allowed to approach closely that of F-2 for the purpose of making intersystem interference measurements. At Paumalu, the 26-meter (85-foot) antenna was operating with F-2 while the 13-meter (42-foot) antenna was available for experimental work with F-4. Experiments and measurements of interference were made as the satellites approached to within 0.50 of each other. It was concluded from these interference measurements that the INTEISAT II system can be safely operated with a minimum of 1.60 of longitude separation between satellites.

Multiple-access service was successfully initiated with the INTELSAT II satellite (F-2) on January 27, 1969. The first INTELSAT III satellite (F-1) was launched in 'September 1968, but no orbit was achieved. This was followed by the launch of INTELSAT III F-2 on December 18, 1968. This satellite began operational service over the Atlantic on December 24, 1968. It operated satisfactorily until June of 1969, at which time sticking of the mechanically despin antenna was encountered. This was determined to be due to a thermal gradient problem across the bearings of the despin motor. By August of 1969, the satellite was back in operatioial service. It continued to be em­ ployed until February 1, 1970, when INTELSAT I F-6 assumed the operational load over the Atlantic Ocean and F-2 was retired from service. INTELSAT III F-3 was launched into orbit over the Pacific on February 5, 1969. It was placed into opera­ tional service on February 16, 1969, and continued to be employed in the Pacific loca­ tion for about 6 months. F-3 was then repositioned over the Indian Ocean after losing about 6 dB of transponder gain due to a malfunction in one stage of the receiver tunnel diode amplifier. The reduced channel loading associated with operations at the Indian 10-56 Ocean location permitted the satellite to continue in a useful capacity. -INTELSAT III F-4 replaced F-3 in handling the Pacific Ocean operational traffic.

The first INTELSAT IV satellite (F-2) was successfully launched into orbit over the Atlantic Ocean on January 25, 1971. Communications tests began on February 7, and on March 26 earth station antennas in 14 countries, then operating with the INTELSAT III F-6 satellite, began a simultaneous mass pointover to assume opera­ tional service through the INTELSAT IV F-2 satellite. The second INTELSAT IV satellite (F-3) was launched into orbit, also over the Atlantic Ocean on December 19, 1971. It was positioned, tested and then placed into service on February 19, 1972, at 340.5 E longitude. Subsequently, it was moved to 335°E longitude where it continues in service, replacing F-2 which is now in reserve at 3400E longitude. INTELSAT IV F-4 was launched into orbit over the Pacific on January 22, 1972, and placed into service on February 19, 1972, at 1940E longitude, taking over service from INTELSAT InI F-4.

The country covers nearly 9,656 In (6000 miles) from east to west and over 4,023 km (2500 miles) from north to south. For the Soviet Union, whose territory extends up to 800N latitude, geostationary orbits are not ideal because they do not ensure communications at earth station ele­ ° vation angles greater than 7.5 for all areas that lie above 700N latitude. The Soviet Union's communication satellites system, using the Molniya-1 and the more recent Molniya-2 spacecraft, circumvents this difficulty by employing the highly eccentric elliptical orbits described below. The orbit chosen for the Molniya satellites is interesting for two reasons. First, it is highly elliptical with an apogee of 39,633 km (21,400 n. mi.) in the northern hemi­ sphere, a perigee of 500 km (270 n. mi.) in the southern hemisphere and an orbital period of nearly 12 hours; Thus, the two daily orbital apogees for any given satellite occur 1800 apart over earth longitudes. Second, the angle of inclination of 650 means that the period during which one of the two daily orbits of the satellite can be employed for radio communication between distant points in the USSR is between 8 and 10 hours. The second daily orbit cuts diagonally across the Western Hemisphere on its ascending pass, and has been used on alimited basis to provide a Moscow-Cuba link.

The second daily orbit cuts diagonally across the Western Hemisphere on its ascending pass, and has been used on alimited basis to provide a Moscow-Cuba link. This secondary low utilization orbit (Figure 11-1) provides maximum mutual visibility of Washington and Moscow. In Figure 11-2, the mutual visibility of the Washington- Moscow link is plotted as a function of the ascending node of the orbit: The shaded bar areas indicate the two daily longitudes of the ascending node of the existing Molniya-1 satellites.

Mutual Visibility Duration Versus Longitude of the Ascending Node graph indicates that the optimum right ascension is approximately 200W (3400E) longi­ tude, which provides 10.5 hours of continuous coverage from a single satellite. Ifthree Molniya communication satellites are launched at regular intervals into identical elliptical orbits-whose planes are shifted relative to one another by 1200, they will form a system that ensures 24 hour-per-day communications for the entire USSR. It should be noted that this orbit also affords the possibility of continuous communication between the European USSR and North and Central America, thereby establishing communications between most parts of the northern hemisphere, where 75 to 80 percent of the earth's population resides. It should be noted that an elliptical orbit offers an additional important advan­ tage for the Soviet Union. For a launch vehicle of given thrust operating from the appropriate Soviet launch site, two or three times more weight can be placed into the selected elliptical orbit than into an equatorial synchronous one. The Molniya program has been responsible for a number of other innovations in satellite communications technology. Major advances demonstrated by the Molniya-1 satellites are: flywheel stabilization, solar panels that were continually maintained in a 900 aspect relative to the sun line by proper positioning of the body of the space­ craft, and parabolic antennas that tracked the earth independent of the main body of the satellite. This program also produced the first system supplying a regular space television distribution service to a large number of receiving terminals which were widely dispersed geographically. 11.1.1 Hotline -Direct Communications Link Between Washington and Moscow \"The U.

Its more apparent features include the six solar cell panels and thd two parabolic communication antennas (one in reserve). Within the hermetically sealed body are the primary transponder (along with the com­ plete spares), an electronic computer for equipment control, a gyrostabilizer, chemi­ cal batteries, and various electronic equipment.

The combined second and third stage thrust is 1,374,500 new­ tons (309,000 pounds) for a combined total thrust of 6,374,300 newtons (1,433, 000 pounds). When the spacecraft attains its final orbit and has separated from the last stage of the launch vehicle, the solar cell panels, originally folded along the body of the satellite, are automatically extended.

The orientation system is switched on, the satellite's tumbling motion is arrested by gas-jets, and the body of the satellite to­ gether with the solar cell panels is oriented toward the sun to maximize the power for the solar cell system. During the entire orbital trajectory, the spacecraft atti­ tude is maintained by a gyro-stabilizer driven by an electric motor so that the solar panels remain directed toward the sun. After sun acquisition, one of the on-board antennas is directed towards the earth by highly sensitive earth sensors. The earth is acquired, and this antenna con­ tinues to track the earth during the entire period of communication. Should it become necessary to switch to the standby antenna, all that is required is to rotate the body of the satellite 1800 about its longitudinal axis, using the gas-jet stabilizers. A block diagram of the transponder \"Alpha\" used in the Molniya-1 spacecraft is shown in Figure 11-7. The principal communication parameters for Molniya-1 and Molniya-2 are summarized in Table 11-2. Both signal reception and transmission are accomplished with the same parabolic spacecraft antenna; isolation filters are used to separate these signals. The signals received from earth stations operating at two different frequencies are further separated by an input duplexer.

Design lifetime of the later Molniya-1 spacecraft was about 2 years as compared to 1 year for initial versions. 11.4 GROUND TERMINALS Selected characteristics for the earth terminals utilizing the Molniya-1 satel­ lites are presented in Table 11-3. The ground terminal antennas (transmitting and receiving) are 15-meter (50-foot) diameter paraboloids with Cassegrain feeds. They are mounted on rotating units per­ mitting a tracking accuracy of a few angular minutes; tracking is either preprogramed or self-tracking. To decrease losses in the feeder waveguide equipment, bildings are constructed in direct proximity to the rotating units. The parametric amplifiers of the O receiver as well as the receiver duplex and directional coupler have been Installed In an antenna cabin behind the primary reflector. For the output of the parametric am­ plifier, the received IF signal is fed to the receiving equipment located In the building. The high frequency power output from the transmitter building is delivered to the an­ tenna feed along a waveguide through the rotating junction. The transmitting unit consists of an exciter, frequency modulator, power am­ plifier and supply, monitor, and heat exchanger. The transmitter itself is a 5-kw multlcavity klystron. The video bandwidth available for the television mode Is 5 MHz. For more efficient transmission of television and telephone signals, there are stand­ ard preselection systems.

Moreover, a receiver monitor, video monitor, and received signal level recorder are included as parts of the receiving units. The parametric amplifiers of the re­ ceivers are two-stage regenerative amplifier-converters. In the Molniya-1 system, the two-stage parametric amplifiers operate at both normal and liquid nitrogen tem­ peratures. The noise temperature of the uncooled parametric amplifier is 1500 K, and of the cooled is 80°K. The cooled parametric amplifier is installed ahead of an Isolating filter. The frequency passband is sufficient for quality transmission of black and white or color television. For transmission of group spectra, frequency feedback reduces the passband to 1.5 to 2.0 MHz. The Orbita earth terminals, Figure 11-8, are built according to a standard plan and include a circular, concrete building which serves at the same time as the pedestal for the antenna. This places the antenna well above any local obstruction. The an­ tenna is not protected by a radome; however, it is designed to operate between tem­ peratures of 273.15°K ±50'K and in wind velocities approaching 96 kmph (60 mph). It is made of aluminum alloy and weighs approximately 4990 kilograms (5-1/2 tons). The total weight of the entire antenna, support, and its various mechanisms is about 45,000 kilograms (50 tons). The central room in the building under the antenna houses various receiving equipment, the parametric amplifier, etc. Around this room are located offices and the additional services including air conditioning. The arrangements are sketched in Figures 11-9 and 11-10. As of mid-1971, there were approximately 50 Orbita-1 earth terminals. Some of the known Orbita-1 site locations are listed in Table 11-4.

Further, the experiments that may have been conducted are not well documented to the Western World. It is possible that, when the first Molniya-1 spacecraft began to appear in orbit, both the highly elliptical orbit employed and the three-axis stabilizdd satellite, with its sun-oriented solar panels and tracking antennas, were considered experimental in nature. Obviously, these experiments worked out well, since the operational system continued to incorporate the aforementioned features.

The orbital paths of these satellites carry them through the earth's radiation belts several times each day, and studies are being made not only of the radiation belts but also of the effects they have on spacecraft equipment, es­ pecially solar cells. 11.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The Molniya-1 system was designed for relaying wideband transmission of either duplex multichannel telephone communications (including telegraph and fac­ simile) or television (black and white or color). Initially, operations were point-to­ point between Moscow and Vladivostok to provide regular telephone and 'telegraph exchange between the center of the country and the Far East, and to transmit central television programs to viewers in the Maritime territory. The first TV transmission via a Molniya-1 satellite was made on April 25,, 1965, just 2 days after the launch of the first vehicle. Under a Franco-Soviet research program which used Molniya-1, color television broadcasts have been successfully transmitted between Moscow and Paris since December 1967. This research program was preceded by a successful Moscow-Paris demonstration for which the results were reported in documents of the '1966 URSI (CCIR) Meeting in Oslo, Norway. (2) Later, experimental transmissions of newspaper pages and television programs were carried out via Molniya-1. Satisfactory imprinting of newspaper pages from 11-25 Pravda was achieved via transmissions from Khabarovsk (near Vladivostok). How­ ever, the rapid changes in propagation path length on the accent and descent of the elliptical orbit did result in some peculiarities, such as an apparent bending in the received newspaper type page.

As of mid-1971, equipment was being added to Orbjita stations to further expand their telecommunications capability to permit the relaying of computer data. In 1967 the USSR inaugurated a space television distribution system, using Molniya-1 satellites to allow people in Siberia, the Far East, and the Far North to see broadcasts from Moscow. As of mid-1971, there were about 50 ground stations in this network; a few of the known receiving site locations are tabulated in Sec­ tion 1i. 4. The Orbita stations have achieved an extremely high level of reliability of not less than 99.7 percent. A notable event during 1969 was the building of an Orbita receiving station in Ulan-Bator, Mongolia, which began operation on February 2, 1970. A station has also been proposed for Havana, Cuba. A second generation of ground terminals, Orbita 2, has begun to be implemented. In addition to the communication functions served'by the Molniya-1 satellites, certain spacecraft in the series have been fitted with television cameras and have successfully transmitted detailed photographs of the earth's cloud cover from altitudes ranging between 30,000 and 40,000 kin. These pictures were especially important in determining meteorological conditions in conjunction with \"Meteor\" class weather satellites that photographed the earth's cloud cover from near circular 625-km orbits. Molniya-1 satellites have also participated in the Soviet manned space program by relaying communications between surface ships in direct contact with Soyuz-6, -7, and -8 and a central control site within the Soviet Union. 11.6.1 System Status As indicated previously, a single Molniya satellite provides approximately 10 hours of coverage on a single orbital pass. Therefore, three Molniya satellites"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__302", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 302, "text": "space program by relaying communications between surface ships in direct contact with Soyuz-6, -7, and -8 and a central control site within the Soviet Union. 11.6.1 System Status As indicated previously, a single Molniya satellite provides approximately 10 hours of coverage on a single orbital pass. Therefore, three Molniya satellites are sufficient to provide continuous coverage of the Soviet Union for the domestic 11-26 broadcast system. However, for purposes of redundancy, the Soviet Molniya-I sys­ tem appears to be an eight-satellite system consisting of four pairs of satellites spaced 6 hours apart. The system involves four orbital plans in an accurately placed cluster, 900 apart. This assures that two satellites (a pairj are continuously visible over the Moscow-Vladivostok- link, which is-their primary communications link. Very little current detail of the Molniya-2 satellite system is known. As seen from Paragraph 11. 2.2, the Soviets have filed a total of 21 operating frequencies for their satellite, 20 with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz and a downlink of 24. 5 dBW for each carrier. The twenty-first carrier was filed with a bandwidth of 40 MHz and a downlink ERP of 34.5 dBW. One of the channels (voice) is to be made available by the Soviets for the satellite direct communication link with the United States. The system employs FDM/FM/FDIVIA for frequency division multiplexing/frequency modulation/and multiple accessing. It has been shown that each of the two Molniya satellite systems operates on dif­ ferent frequency allocations. It is unlikely that the Orbita earth terminals for one system have a capability for operating with the other system although it is believed that each Orbita-2 terminal possesses both a transmit and receive capability. 11-27 CITED REFERENCES 1.

Overall re­ sponsibility for the DSCP was assigned to the Defense Communications Agency (DCA). This first major step was called the DSCP Phase I, and, as it was implemented, was an outgrowth of Army participation in NASA's Project SYNCOM and an initial system concept calling for medium altitude satellite orbits. By participating in the SYNCOM Program, the Army gained a nucleus of ground terminals and operating ex­ perience applicable in the DSCP Phase I. (1) The satellites resulting from the initial medium altitude system concept were simple state-of-the-art spacecraft. Subse­ quent to their design, the Titan IIIC became available as a launch vehicle. 2 In June 1966, the first seven Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) Phase I satellites were successfully orbited by a Titan IIIC booster. The initial objectives of shown in Table 12-1. (4)(5)the program are No ground commands were permitted in developing the hardware for the DSCS Phase I-satellite.

The initial objectives of shown in Table 12-1. (4)(5)the program are No ground commands were permitted in developing the hardware for the DSCS Phase I-satellite. However, simplicity and conservatism were stressed in the de­ sign of the communication subsystem. Thus, there was no active control of position or orientation of the satellite either during deployment or during the life of the sys­ tem. The period immediately after the first launch was used for system testing be­ tween deployed terminals. In particular, a two-channel full duplex link capability between two AN/MSC-46 terminals was demonstrated. In December 1966, emergency operational links were established between Hawaii-RVN and Philippines-RVN; in July 1967, the Pacific network was placed in operational status, and integration of DCS was begun. Thus, designed as an R&D system, the DSCS almost immediately 12-1 became an operational system, though some R&D was continued in other portions of the system. Table 12-1.

It provides near-synchronous communication satellites to relay voice and digital communications between fixed and mobile users. Twenty-six DSCS Phase I satellites were launched into near equatorial orbits at a near synchronous altitude of approximately 33, 891,600 meters (18, 300 nautical miles) via the four launches shown in Table 12-2. (6)(7)(8) The Titan IHC was used for the launching vehicle. Satellite dispensers were used and thenecessary facilities were available to implemeht and support the launching operation, the satellite injec­ tion into orbit, the ensuing telemetry readout, and the tracking and ephemeris de­ terminations. The technical support of the launching phase was provided by the Air 12-2 Force Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF). Since the completion of the launches, the SCF has providedorbital tracking data and telemetry monitoring to determine satellite health. This information is forwarded to the Satellite Communication Con­ trol Facility (SCCF) to be used in system control. Table 12-2.

The manufacturer and sponsor of the Titan IC launch vehicles was Martin Marietta, DOD/DCA/SAMSO. 12.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Eight of the initial 26 satellites were still operational as of May 1974. The satellites, as viewed from the earth, drift from west to east at about 300 longitude per day. A single satellite stays within view of a particular earth terminal about 4-1/2 days. A varying distribution of satellites encircling the earth exists, since each satellite was released from the dispenser at a slightly different orbital velocity. The differential velocities are arranged to reduce \"bunching\" of satellites, thus en­ hancing satellite availability. Originally designed for a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 1.5 years (with a goal of 3 years), the satellites have exceeded this goal. (9) The satellite transmitters were designed to turn off automatically 6 to 6-1/2 years from the date of launch but all of the automatic turn-off devices failed to operate leaving some of the satellites operational beyond that time interval. 12-3 There were three types of terminals used in the DSCS Phase I (see Table 12-3). Two AN/FSC-9 terminals were used -one located at Camp Roberts, California, and the other at Fort Dix, New Jersey. They were fixed installations, each equipped with 18-meter (60-foot) diameter antenna. The AN/MSC-46 earth terminals developed for DSCS Phase I are transportable units with 12-meter (40-foot) diameter antennas. The highly transportable AN/TSC-54 terminals were used for extension of the DCS into contingency areas, for tributary-type links to outlying activities, and as Navy shore stations. Local conditions dictate the type of transmission facility used as an interconnect link. Table 12-3.

All earth terminals used FDM/FM and pseudonoise (PN). The AN/TSC-54 terainals and the AN/MSC-46 terminals were capable of operating with MFSK. PN modulation yields a degree of antijam protection to the system. 12-4 ERMANY KOREA SHEMYA G RDT&E FT. DIX OKINAWA COLORADO HAWAII HAWAII0 BRANDYWINE CP.

The SCCF is the focal point of the control subsystem, and is collocated with the DCA Operations Center (DCAOC) in Arlington, Virginia. The primary mission of the SCCF is'to prepare and distribute long term (60 days prepared every 30 days), short term (up to 30 days duration), and emergency satellite/terminal schedules in accordance with validated user requirements. To establish communications between two terminals, it is necessary that a satellite be mutually visible to the terminals. The SCCF is able to provide satellite scheduling data for all links for a 60-day interval. Satellite visibility prediction based on probabilistic analysis for various links is shown in Figure 12-2 as a function of the total number of orbiting satellites: The visibility for the Hawaii-Republic of Viet Nam links is shown both for at least one satellite and for at least two satellites. Two satellites would be required when the channel requirements exceed the capability of one satellite. Thus, with a system composed of 15 satellites, the probability of at least one satellite being visible for the Hawaii-RVN link is 89 percent and that of a second satelite for a second link is 64 percent. Since there is no orbital control to permit repositioning of the satellites, random gaps can occur for the orbital plane. In addition, satellites may become temporarily unusable due to conjunctions with, other satellites or with the sun or moon. Also, since the satellites have no batteries, they do not operate during eclipse (while in the-earth's shadow). The satellite frequency plan is contained in Table 12-4.

The mixing frequencies are derived from a basic oscillator and multi-: plier chains. The output of the IF amplifier/limiter is then summed with the beacon signal, up converted, and fed through the traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) and out to the transmitting antenna. A redundant TWTA automatically switches on in case the first TWTA fails. The switchover can occur only once. 12-8 SPGFigure 12-3. Phase I Satellite OF POOR 9UALI 12-9 I\"! Figure 12-4.

The shipboard program AN/SSC-3 was cancelled. The other three terminals will be described in this section. All terminals were developed to simultaneously transmit and receive opposite senses of circular polarization and to automatically track satellites in circular orbits as low as 9,260,000 meters (5000 nautical miles). Table 12-7 summarizes the character­ istics of these earth terminals. 1. AN/FSC-9 This terminal type was originally developed for the Advent program and was converted to meet the requirements of the DSCS and other experi­ mental programs. Figure 12-6 is a photograph of the AN/FSC-9 and Figure 12-7 is a simplified block diagram of the ground terminal. The antenna is an 18-meter (60-foot) diameter paraboloid reflector with an automatic tracking feed system. The reflector for the antenna includes a superstructure that acts as a counterweight and provides housing for electronic equipment. The estimated weight of the antenna is 172,000 kg (190 tons). The antenna was designed to operate with low altitude satellites and hence, the axes have rotational rates of about 100 per second. Also, the antenna was originally designed to operate at SYNCOM frequencies; thus, its gain when converted to the DSCS frequencies was lower than an 12-12 0 Table 12-5.

Multiplies a total of 12 incoming user voice channels, a 0-to 4. 0-kHz orderwire, and the out-of-band TTYs into a 300-Hz to 52-kHz base­ band package. One TTY channel serves as a terminal orderwire, while the second TTY channel may serve as a TCF-to-TCF order­ wire.

To facilitate operations, an additional teletypewriter channel is used as an orderwire. Figure 12-8 is a simplified block dia­ gram of the AN/MSC-46. The AN/MSC-46 terminal is housed in a cargo van, a maintenance van, an operations control van (OCV), and an inflatable radome. Power is fur­ nished by three diesel generators of 100 kW each, or local commercial power may be used. The complete terminal, including the disassembled antenna and radome, can be transported in C-124, C-130E, and C-5 air­ craft. The total weight Is approximately 51,700 kgm (114,000 pounds). After arrival on site, a crew of eight trained men is required to erect the terminal. The operational configuration is presented in Figure 12-9. The AN/MSC-46 terminal uses a 12-meter (40-foot) diameter Cassegrain type antenna to track medium altitude to synchronous communication satel­ lites. The reflector is mounted on a transportable pedestal which uses a tripod ground support. The RF room, which contains the receiver and high-powered amplifier, is located directly behind the main reflector. The antenna feed is a four-horn (modified) monopulse, circularly polarized feed that Is used for both transmitting and receiving.

The AN/MSC-46 antennas have been modified by replacing the subreflector assembly with a single Dielguide (dielectric cone) feed. The AN/MSC-46 terminal is equipped with the same FM and PN (pseudo­ noise) modulation and multiplex equipment as described for the AN/FSC-9. The AN/MSC-46 terminals also have the AN/TCC-3 five-channel multi­ plex unit. The baseband configuration of the top four channels is inverted; i.e., the carriers and lower sidebands are suppressed. The baseband configuration of the AN/FCC-55 multiplex is upright; i.e., the carriers and upper sidebands are suppressed. Thus, the AN/TCC-3 baseband is incompatible with the AN/FCC-55 baseband. The prime power requirements of the AN/MSC-46 terminal are outlined as follows: voltage, 3 phase, 120/208 V ± 10 percent, 50 or 60 Hz ± 5 per­ cent, 175 kW. These requirements may be filled for most terminals by either local com­ mercial power or by three 100-kW diesel generators which are a part of the terminal configuration. The radome is a fixed enclosure that offers protection for the antenna against wind, sand, dust, salt spray, rain and ice. It is built to operate with an internal overpressure of 8273.7 newton/meter 2 (1.2 psi) relative to atmospheric pressure.

Detachable ground mobilizers (GOAT mobilizer -travels over all terrains) are supplied to tow the terminal over unimproved terrain. The equipment can also be airlifted by hell­ copter. The entire system weighs less than 7938 kilograms (17,500 pounds) without fuel; no single package weighs more than 2,722 kilograms (6000 pounds). Also, the maximum dimensions and overall weight are compatible with the loading capability of cargo air­ craft such as the C-13OE. The AN/TSC-54 terminal uses an array of four 3.0-meter (10-foot) diam­ eter parabolic dishes, each of which has a Dielguide feed for Cassegrain illumination, providing a 5.5-meter (18-foot) effective diameter. The antenna is supported and stabilized in the operational configuration by tripod outriggers. The Klystron power amplifier, exciter and power supplies are mounted in the antenna pedestal base.

The experiments and,development testing that had been performed through mid-1971 are summarized in Table 12-8. Although the DSCS Phase I was designed as an R&D satellite system it became almost immediately an operational one. Soon after -the first launch a two channel full duplex link capability between two AN/MSC-46 terminals was demonstrated. In July 1967 the Pacific network was placed in operational status, marking the beginning of DSCS integration into the DCS. 12.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The IDCSP has become an operational long-haul satellite comtmunications sys­ tem.

Also a number of times the satellite has resumed tumbling and has had to be restabiized. Causes have not been determined for all these tumbling occurrences priority military voice channels for a 10-day period while the commercial Trans Pac submarine cable was broken east of the Philippines. Another submarine cable failure between Thailand and RVN in October 1967 was temporarily covered by the TDCSP. Since the first satellite launch in June 1966, the satellites have performed better than expected. The major cause of failure has been the failure to turn on again after coming out of eclipse; and in some cases such failed satellites have turned on after subsequent eclipses. The next most frequent problem has been failure of the automatic TWT switching system resulting in switched TWTs before they have actually failed. As of mid-1971 valid TWT switching had been experienced on three satellites as a result of failures. However, switching had also occurred on three other satel­ lites for no known reason. The major failure experienced with the ground terminals was-with the mainte­ nance of the cryogenic cooling system in the AN/MSC-46 terminals. These were to be field-maintainable, but had-to be returned to the manufacturer for maintenance. The problem was subsequently fixed by modification. Another problem area was an oversensitive tracking system due to its design to track polar orbiting satellites. A modification narrowing the tracking bandwidth solved this problem. For the AN/ MSC-46 terminals the MTTF experienced was about 75 hours. For AN/TSC-54 ter­ minals it was about 300 hours. 12-29 CITED REFERENCES 1. J. W.

In 1964, the.program concept was broadened to include experiments pertinent to meteorology, navigation, and general, spacecraft technology. The multidimensioned project thus formed was called the Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) program. By consolidating multiple experi­ ments into a single program,.

By consolidating multiple experi­ ments into a single program,. NASA realized significant cost reductions and structured a program that was directly responsive to the responsibilities assigned NASA under the Space Act of 1958 and the Satellite Act of 1962. The ATS program, as initially conceived and approved by Congress, was, a multiyear project involving five unique satellites launched into space to conduct some. 20 major experiments and a number of related data-gathering studies. Major objec­ tives of the five flights were to: (1) investigate technology common to a numbei'of space applications; (2) investigate technology for the synchronous orbit; (3) develop spacecraft stabilization techniques; and (4) develop experiments for several satellite applications. The underlying design philosophy, in developing these satellites, was to provide a large and adaptable volume for mounting the various experiment payloads while employing basic satellite configurations appropriate for either spin or gravity­ gradient ,stabilization. Two satellites were designed in the spin stabilized configu­ ration and three were gravity gradient stabilized. Two subconfigurations existed for the gravity gradient stabilized satellites. The first of the three satellites employing this stabilization technique was designed for a medium altitude circular 13-1 orbit where no stationkeeping was necessary. The two subsequent spacecraft were configured for operation in synchronous equatorial orbits. Each of the five satellites contained a separate complement of experiments with a relatively low level of experiment repetition from spacecraft to spacecraft. (2) The, exception to the latter was the C-Band communications experiments. All five satellites included identical C-Band repeaters for conducting these experiments. As development and launching of the initial five satellites proceeded, and NASA began to look towards the future, the main thrust of the ATS program objectives became more exclusively communications oriented.

As development and launching of the initial five satellites proceeded, and NASA began to look towards the future, the main thrust of the ATS program objectives became more exclusively communications oriented. NASA's ATS research effort is now directed towards advanced techniques for bringing satellite communications to an ever-increasing number of small, perhaps mobile, users having multiple access to the satellite system; toward broadcast satellite applications, both radio and tele­ vision; toward more efficient techniques of frequency utilization through investigation of millimeter wavelengths; and toward satellite aids to lunar, planetary, and inter­ planetary communications. ATS-6, a high power, three-axis stabilized spacecraft featuring a deployable 9.1-m (30-foot) parabolic reflector antenna, was sent into a near perfect, earth syn­ chronous orbit on 30 May 1974.

These categories are listed and defined in Table 13-1. (3)(4) Primary objectives of the SHF (C-Band) communications experiments were to: (1) evaluate a multiple access system having a 1200-channel capacity in voice, teletype, data, and facsimile modes of operation; (2) evaluate 13-2 wideband transmission techniques;(3) investigate polarization and transmission phenomena; and (4) provide a communications transmission capability in support of other ,applications technology satellite experiments. Major VH communications objectives were to demonstrate the feasibility of continuous air-to-ground and ship­ to-shore voice communications through a satellite.

Specific refinements to the state-of-the-art, contributed by the ATS-1 and 3 test programs, were'innumerable. There were four contributions of major impor­ tance in satellite communication; two of these were in the area of despun antenna technology. ATS-1 demonstrated the feasibility and potential of electronic-despinning using phased arrays while ATS-3 displayed the feasibility and attractiveness of mechanically-despun antennas. The SHF multiple access experiments showed the possibility of the practical implementation of a system employing single-sideband frequency division multiplexing on the uplink and phase modulation by the composite 13-5 received signal on the downlink. Additionally, the feasibility of VHF communications through a synchronous satellite by small mobile earth terminals was demonstrated. 13.2.2 System Description The SHF tests with ATS-1 involved all of the terminals listed in Table 13-3. Loop back, half duplex, full duplex, and three terminal multiple access test configu­ rations were all employed. For the ATS-3 tests only Rosman and Mojave terminals had satellite visibility. Tests were therefore performed on a loop back, half duplex, and full duplex basis. VHF tests were conducted in all of these configurations from loop back through full duplex linking. Satellite transponder non-linearity, plus power and bandwidth limitations, tended to limit multiple access capabilities.

They conducted base­ line evaluations of the satellite VHF transponder and theVHF propagation link to serve as a reference for testing with mobile and remote'data terminals. The NASA terminals also participated in the latter tests as central land bases. Typical earth coverages supplied by the geostationary satellites, ATS-1 and ATS-3, are shown in Figure 13-1. Operating frequencies for the spin stabilized Applications Technology Satellites are shown in Tables 13-4, 5, and 6. (5) The 6-and 4-GHz frequencies were selected to be compatible with the international allocations for commercial satellite communi­ cations. The VHF frequencies were selected for a communications experiment because of compatibility with existing frequencies employed for spacecraft TT&C and conventional hardware that could readily be supplied for small mobile terminals (e. g., aircraft terminals). 13-6 60 60 TERMINAL ANTEINA EL EVATION ANGLE. 3O ; 0120 IS0 180 160 120 90 6D 30 Figure 13-1.

When in this mode (i. e., SSB-FD1VIA/PM-) the spacecraft is a signal processing repeater. Single side band (SSB) signals-from individual terminals are frequency division multiplexed on the uplink. The individual signals are combined in the spacecraft and down-converted to provide a composite baseband that phase modulates the transmitted carrier. The downlink signal is detected by a discriminator in the ground terminal receiver and demultiplexed to derive the desired individual message. In this system, uplink noise becomes a more significant factor in determining total performance but requirements for frequency spectrum and uplink power control are reduced. The use of SSB modu­ lation on the uplink tended to restrict the traffic handled to conventional 4-kHz voice. Table 13-7.

With the exception of the high power TWTs on one transponder of ATS-3, the SHF transponders aboard the two spacecraft were virtually identical. Functional diagrams. depicting each of the three possible modes of the transponder (i. e., frequency translation, multiple access, and onboard camera) are given in Figures 13-2, 13-3, and 13-4. The VHF trans­ ponder on each spacecraft is illustrated in Figure 13-5. As indicated by the figure, the VHF transponder on ATS-3 differed from that on ATS-1 in that a capability existed to cross strap the VHF receiver to the transmitter of one of the SHF trans­ ponders. In this mode of operation, selectable by ground command, the SHF transponder was operated in the camera mode and the received VHF signal was down-converted to serve as the input to the SHF transponder's voltage controlled oscillator. 13. 2. 4 Ground Terminals Two of the three NASA ATS terminals, Rosman and Mojave, are large multi­ functional installations supporting numerous other NASA programs. Characteristics of the ATS related facilities at all three locations are summarized in Table 13-12. (See References 5 through 8 and 11. ) Major subsystems of the NASA ATS terminals are depicted in the functional block diagram of Figure 13-6.

Major Subsystems of a NASA ATS Terminal. 13.2.5 Experiments Experiments conducted as part of the spin stabilized ATS program are listed in Table 13-13. (3)(4)(5) The table shows the seven major experiment categories, listed in Table 13-1, into which the individual experiments can be grouped. In the case of the satellite VHF transponder experiments, some overlap between categories existed. These transponders supported selected meteorology and navigation experi­ menfs in addition to the communications and propagation experiments. Specifically, in the WEFAX experiment, the satellite VH'F transponder relayed Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) weather data (including ATS SSCC photographs) in facsimile format from Suitland, Maryland to Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) stations in the U. S., Japan, and Australia. (12) As part of OPLE, the spacecraft VHF repeater relayed interrogations and responses between the OPLE Control Center (OCC) and small remote platforms which were sometimes in motion. Responses included data from local sensors and OMEGA navigation system VLF tones received at the remote platforms and up converted to VHF. (13) Various other navigation and postion location experiments employed the spacecraft VHF transponder for ranging measurements. The meteorological experiments, defined in Table 13-13, produced a vast number of high quality pictures from the spacecraft camera systems and demonstrated the feasibility of weather facsimile through the satellite's VHF repeater. The space­ craft stabilization experiments have displayed that nutation sensing and damping, for nutation angles between 0. 0010 and 5. 00, can be satisfactorily accomplished and that hydrazine thrusters are feasible; the resistojet stabilization experiment was not as successful.

The phased array antenna, employed on ATS-1, consisted of 16 antennas arranged around a circle of one wavelength radius with each antenna composed of four collinear dipoles. Phasing of the radiated output was accomplished using eight ferrite phase shifters. Each phase shifter provided two equal amplitude out­ puts whose phase was varied in an opposite sense by inputs from the Phased Antenna Control Electronics, PACE. The two phase shifter outputs were connected to two diametrically opposite antennas. The PACE derived phase shifter control signals from satellite spin rate inputs and orbital position. This antenna system realized a measured in-orbit gain of about 12, 5 dB with a beamwidth of approximately 220 due to the array. Beamwidth due to the stack of dipoles was determined, prior to launch, to be about 17% The PACE system demonstrated reliable performance and accurate pointing of the radiated beam. The total drive power requirement of the phase shifters was about 2 watts. The mechanically despun antenna, employed on ATS-3, consisted of a rotating cylindrical parabolic collimator illuminated by a two element collinear array feed. Each array element was a full wave dipole. The parabolic collimator was rotated in opposition to the direction of spacecraft spin by a 128-step synchronous stepping motorand encoder controlled by the Mechanical Antenna Control Electronics, MACE. The MACE system was essentially identical tO the, PACE system employed on ATS-1.

The MACE system was essentially identical tO the, PACE system employed on ATS-1. The measured in-orbit gain of this antenna was about 17 dB with a beamwidth of approximately 20. The PACE system displayed a capability of pointing the antenna beam towards the earth within about ±0.7 degrees. Antenna system reliability was, in general, quite good. During the satellite's first year in orbit, several malfunctions of the despinning mechanism were observed due to stalling of the stepping motor. No thermal effects could be related to this anomaly. It was hypothesized that a failure of the electric damper circuit associated with the stepping motor Regulator 13-20 No. 2 was responsible for the abnormal behavior. A switchover to backup electronics eliminated these malfunctions. -Prime objectives .ofthe microwave communications experim.ents-were -defined in Paragrdph 13.2. 1.

The spacecrat teldvisi6dcahn'ras were the chief beneficiaries of this hiodd of operation.. Multiple access experiments of-primary interest and their basic results are described in Table 13-14. (7)(14) Additionally, measurements of system noise power ratio and muliiplex channel linearity,, envelope delay, harmonic distortion, and frequency response were carried outiwi{h satisfactory results.

Investigations of transmission phenomena included measurements of spacecraft spin modulation, transmit and receive antenna patterns, and repeater saturation characteristics plus ground terminal G/T, antenna pointing accuracy, and transmit and receive antenna patterns. Results were in general agreement with previous independent measurements and theoretical expectations. Investigations of polari-\" zation phenomena included evaluations of SHIF Faraday rotation as projected from VH1F measurements and the effect of satellite antenna beam position on observed polarizationi at the ground. The latter determined that the ATS-1 polarization angles (polang) changes about 0.110 per degree change in'satellite beam position while the 4° ATS-3 polang is constant to approximately from peak of beam.

(5)Participating ships have included the Coast Guard cutters Glacier and ' Klimath, the S. S. Santa Lucia,(21) and the German ships Gauss and Meteor. Successful experiments have been conducted with ships operating in the Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic and the Atlantic Oceans. Indications were that S/N ratios of about 40 dB could conveniently be attained on a voice channel and data error rates on the order of 103 and 104 bits/bit realized at 600 bps transmission rates. Short term fade depths in the order of 12 dB were observed in some tests. Data dissemination in a meteorological network was displayed in the WE FAX experiment; Data collection from small unmanned stations was' demonstrated-as\" part of OPLE.

The latter include measurements of multipath, scintillation, and Faraday rotation effects. Each satellite's telemetry beacon and the Third Harmonic Generator (i. e. , third harmonic of telemetry beacon) on ATS-3 have also been employed for such measure­ ments. These measurements, in addition to supplying direct propagation information, have been useful in studies to determine the temporal makeup of the earth's ionosphere. 13. 2. 6 Operational Results Since ATS-1 and 3 were experimental satellites, no operational traffic was carried. The operational performance of the NASA ATS ground terminals was good. In general, it was also shown that operational mobile VHF terminals were feasible. However, in specific cases of hastily assembled experimental VHF facilities, operational difficulties including insufficient transmitter power, antenna anomalies, and poor equipment reliability were encountered, The operational performance of the two spin stabilized satellites was basically quite good. Specific minor difficulties encountered on ATS-1 included a gradial decay of radiated power when both SHF transponders and all four TWTs were energized and occasional SSCC picture streaking.

The former was determined 13-28 to be a temperature problem and operation with.three TWTs was -found to be sustain­ able. The latteroccurred during periods when the spacecraft load exceeded solar array output to the extent that the batteries were depleted resulting in an abnbrmally low battery voltage. Operational difficulties on ATS-3 included the failure of one 12-watt TWT to operate, a spurious SHF emission at 4201 MHz when operating in the FT mode, spacecraft response to commands intended for ATS-I, and a malfunction of the mechanically despun antenna (MDA). The spurious SHF emission was conjectured to te due to thermal effects, occuring during eclipse, creating an electrical or mechanical/electrical path,to allow sustained passage of sufficient electrical energy to activate the VCO employed in the SSB-FDMA/PM mode. Responses to ATS-1 commands were determined to be due to the address assignments made and not due to equipment abnormalities. As a result, the address assignments for ATS-4 and 5 were changed. The despun antenna malfunction was verified to be produced by stalling of the MDA motor as discussed in Paragraph 13.2.5. 13.2.6.1 Additional Services ATS-1 . Some services performed by ATS-1 in addition to technological and scientific ex­ periments were the relay of special TV programs such as the first splashdown of the Apollo moonflight, EXPO 67 in Australia, and the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to Australia; the performance of special SHIF tests such as mass data transfer and antenna beam control during the eclipse; relay of special VHF communications such as emer­ gency communications during the Alaskan flood and magnetic studies at field line base; and relay of special weather facsimile for air operations in the Pacific.

Some of these services included support of the Apollo missions; TV cover­ age of Pope Paul's visit to Bogota, Columbia; special SIF tests such as the IEEE International Communication Conference; VHF relay of special commands to ATS-4 from Johannesburg; demonstration of automatic picture transmission at NASA head­ quarters by the weather facsimile (WEFAX) experiment on board the ATS-3; real-time data support of the OSO-IV satellite; and provided an RF collimation source for the Canadians. (40) Through a series of maritime experiments, involving both ship position location and ship-to-shore communications through the spacecraft, ATS-3 has demonstrated that major improvements .in the management of shipping fleets can be made by use of the capabilities of synchronous-orbit communications satellites. ATS-3 will be used in conjunction with ATS-6 in Health-Education Telecommuni­ (42)cations Experiment for both the Rocky Mountain area and the Appalachian Region. 13-30 13.3 GRAVITY GRADIENT STABILIZED SATELLITES' 13.3.1 General Description The experiments carried on the Application Technology Satellites that featured evaluations of gravity gradient stabilization can be grouped into six major categories.

These categories are listed and defined in Table 13-18.(28), (29), (30) The objectives of the SHF C-Band experiments were the same as indicated in the \"General Descrip­ tion\" of the spin stabilized ATS (see Section 13.2.1). The objectives of the L-Band experiments were to demonstrate the feasibility of air-to-ground communications at these frequencies and to investigate propagation effects. The objective of the milli­ meter wave experiment was to investigate propagation at 15 and 32 GHz. Three active repeater satellites (i.e., ATS-2, ATS-4, and ATS'5) were launched during the ATS program for the express major purpose of evaluating gravity gradient stabilization. The status of these spacecraft is reviewed in Table 13-19. Table 13-18.

This pre­ cluded proper testing of the gravity gradient control system although the stabilization booms were successfully deployed.

Altitude control and station-keeping maneuvers produced ATS-4 (i. e., ATS-D prior to launch) fell short of its intended synchronous orbit when the Centaur failed to re-ignite for a second burn leaving the spacecraft in a low altitude parking orbit with the Centaur still attached. Shortly after second burn failure, the ATS-4-Centaur conglomerate went into a tumble about a traverse axis. Subsequent maneuvers by the spacecraft attitude control systems were unable to completely correct this condition. As a result the gravity gradient system could not be tested and little information was obtained on the other satellite experiments although all subsystems appeared to be operating properly. Among the operations accomplished was a partial deployment of the stabilizing booms, boom scissoring and successful firing of the ion engines. 13-32 Table 13-20. Location Bedford,.

Spin stabilization about this axis was the planned method of satellite control-during the transfer orbit, apogee motor firing, and maneuvers to position the spacecraft on station. -However, greater than expected nutation during this phase produced loss of spacecraft control and ultimately resulted in the present spin about the proper axis but in a direction opposite (i. e., counterclockw'se) to that needed for the planned­ operation of' the two-stage yo-yo despin mechanism. Consequently, a scheduled investigation of gravity gradient stabilization was again left unaccomplished. Modi­ fications to earth terminal'equipment, however, have allowed many of the remaining experiments'aboard this satellite to be partially successful. In particular, objectives have been partially attained with regard to the millimeter wave, L-Band, and environ­ mental measurements experiments. The primary earth terminals involved in the few C-Band communications opera­ tions conducted -included the terminals employed for-the testing on ATS-1 and ATS-3 (see TAble 13-3) with the addition of the terminal at Ahmedabad, India. The latter became operational in 1967 and conducted tests and demonstrations with ATS-2. The major terminals participating in the L-Band and millimeter wave tests on ATS-5 are defined in Table 3-20. (31, 32, 33) All of these terminals became operational in 1969­ and 19.70.

The launch difficulties on ATS-2 and 4 precluded any significant contributions to satellite communications by the experiments on board these spacecraft. However, ATS-5 did make several contributions, first, its millimeter wave experiment has provided valuable data that will contribute towards opening this band for satellite 13-34 communications; secondly, its L-Band experiment has given a preliminary indication of the potential that these frequencies hold for aircraft and maritime control, com­ munications, and navigation; and third, this satellite displayed the 'poiential difficul­ ties involved in injecting a gravity gradient stabiltzed satellite into a synchronous orbit and deploying it to a desired station. 13.3.2 System Description The SHF (i.e. C-Band) tests conducted Were done primarily on a loop back or half duplex basis. The system configuration for the millimeter wave tests was as shown in Figure 13-7. The figure indicates, uplink propagation measurements were performed in the satellite and telemeter&d'to the ground. Downlink measurements are performed on the ground. A system block diagram of the initially planned L-Band communications test configuration is shown in Figure 13-8. Signals are sent from the ground stations to the satellite at C-Band. These signals are combined in the satellite and retransmitted to the aircraft at L-Band. The ground stations monitor the L-Band transmissions from the sat6llite for' frequency control and ground-to­ satellite range measurements. Aircraft transmissions arrive at the satellite at L-Band where they are combined and transferred to C-Band for transmission to the ground stations.

The earth coverage supplied by ATS-5 for the millimeter wave and L-band tests is shown in Figure 13-9. SHF, C-Band, operating frequencies on the gravity gradient stabilized space­ craft were the same as on ATS'I & 3 (see Table 13-4). The same is true of the TT&C frequencies (see Table 13-6). The millimeter wave and L-Band operating frequehcies are. shown in Table 13-21. (31, 32) The indi­ cated millimeter wave frequencies are of interest in that they are located at the first two windows in the frequency spectrum above 10 GHz where water vapor and oxygen absorption are low. Millimeter wave propagation, in general, is of interest in that it offers a possible means of reducing overcrowding in the lower bands. Additionally, it offers extremely wideband capabilities, high gain-small aperture antenna 13-35 r ATS-V SPACECRAFT STATUS - MODULATOR 15 3 GHz TRANSMITTER TELEMETRY SUBSYSTEMS COMMAND SUBSYStEMS NASA MMW STATION ROSMAN.

The 'L-Band frequen6ies are of interest for aircraft control, navigation, and communications. The VHF fre­ quencies are also commonly considered for this purpose since they are compatible with existing equipment. L-Band offers the potential of more accurate satellite ranging and wider bandwidths for multiple access communications and control. Table 13-21. Millimeter Wave and L7Band Frequencies (GHz) Millimeter Wave L-Band , Uplink Downlink Uplink Downlink 31.65 15.3 1.65 1.55 The basic signal processing techniques employed-for C-Band tests were the same as used in ATS-1 and ATS-3 tests (see Tables 13-7 and 13-8).. The millimeter wave experiment provided two complete and independent propagation measurement links. Similar signal processing techniques were employed on each link. It basi­ cally consisted of modulating a carrier with a single tone such that a carrier and first order upper and lower sidebands all of equal -level are produced. This was accomplished by a varactor phase modulator in the satellite and a varactor frequency upconverter, which was capable of AM, FM, or PM modulation, in the rground:trans­ mitter. For the uplink, sidebands could be set at + 1. 0, +10, or + 50 MHz from the 31.65 Glz carrier. For the downlink, settings of + 0.1, +1 .0, + 10 or + 50 MHz from the 15.3 GHz carrier were possible (34) Receivers employed down conversion mixing, filtering, envelope detectors, and phase detectors to"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__364", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 364, "text": "set at + 1. 0, +10, or + 50 MHz from the 31.65 Glz carrier.

The L-Band signal processing employedwas dependent uponthe modes selected for satellite operation. Four modes were commonly employed as follows: 13-39 1. Narrowband L-L (FM/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band and retransmits at L-Band (frequency translatioii). 2. Cross Strap L-C & C-L a. L-C Cross-strap (SSB/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band (SSB), translates to video (500 to 600 kHz) and uses the video signal to modulate (FM) the spacecraft C-Band VCO; the output of which is then translated to C-Band and retransmitted. b. C-L Cross-strap (FM/FM) Spacecraft receives at C-Band, frequency translates to L-Band, and retransmits (Frequency translation). 3. L-L (SSB/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band (SSB) translates to video (500 to 600 kHz) and uses the video signal to modulate (FM) the Spacecraft L-Band VCO; the out­ put of which is then translated to L-Band for transmission to the earth station. 4. Wideband Data Mode (FM downlink only) Video signals from onboard-spacecraft equipment modulates (FM) the satel­ lite L-Band VCO the output of which is upconverted to L-Band for transmis­ sion to earth. A fifth possible mode was identical to narrowband L-L (FM/FM) except'a wide bandwidth was supplied. Link performance for modes involving the C-Band downlink and a high uplink S/N was essentially as defined in Tables 13-7 and 13-8.

(34) Maximum received signal level was -85 dBm and mini­ mum sensitivity was -120 dBm. The receiver phase locked on the carrier with the aid of a track-and-search circuit providing a + 5 kHz minimum pull in range over a +320 kHz band. The solid state primary millimeter wave transmitter supplied 250 mW (unmodulated) and 70 mW per line (modulated) of downlink power.

These terminals were described in Table 13-2. Terminals participating in millimeter wave and L-Band experiments were defined in Table 13-20. The millimeter wave installation at NASA's Rosman, North Carolina facility and the L-band installation at Mojave, California are typical of the earth terminals employed for these two respective groups of experiments. Major characteristics of typical millimeter wave and L-Band terminals are described in Table 13-25. (32), (34) Terminal block diagrams are provided in Figures 13-12(31) and 13-13. (32) The millimeter wave terminal block diagram displays the interest that existed in finding meteorological measurement techniques which could be useful in predicting propagation losses at these frequencies. The L-Band terminal was configured such as to allow operation in the satellite L-to C-Band cross strapping mode. The linear polarization employed at the millimeter wave terminal and the circularly-polarized feeds of the L-Band terminal were compatible with. the spacecraft polarizations making link losses due to this source small. 13.3. 5 Experiments Experiments that were planned for ATS-2, 4, and 5 are summarized in Table 13-26.

The stabilization booms were successfully deployed but the tumbling nature of the satellite resulted in the loss of one boom and in another being broken. Operation of the C-Band transponders was demonstrated including transmissions by the earth terminal at Ahmedabad, India. ATS-4 produced even less in the way of successful results than ATS-2. Among the accomplishments were partial deployment and scissoring of the stabilization booms plus successful firing of the ion engines. Some of the experiments on board ATS-5 were also lost when the .spacecraft was left spinning rather than gravity gradient stabilized.

If the booms could be deployed the latter two could be successfully completed. Noteworthy successes have been obtained from the earth environment measurements, L-Band and millimeter wave experiments. The latter two were obtained through ground terminal modifications to accommodate the periodic nature of the received signal, caused by the spacecraft spin. For the millimeter wave experiment, the spacecraft spin rate (i. e., 76 rpm) resulted in a received signal pulse having a 26 ms time duration between 1 dB down points,, that occurred every 789ims( 3 6 ) -Ground complex modifications- to accommodate this type of received signal included exclusive employment of program tracking rather than autotracking, installing a manual override to prevent the receiver phase lock loop 'from going into a search mode during deep fades of the peak signal, tripling the data sampling rate, to 108 samples-per-second (i. e., one every 9.2 ms) and selecting the maximum valued sample as the only valid data point during any given second. Detrimental effebts of the spacecraft spin have included loss of the milli­ meter wave to L-band TV transmission capability, a loss of fade measurement range which in itself was not of major significance, a serious degradation of the differential sideband phase measurement capability due to spin-induced doppler effect and 13-51 settling time of the quadrature phase detectors, and loss of the ability to detect short term signal fades occuring at rates greater than about 0. 5 Hz.

Data was obtained on the statistibs of long-term fades, correlation between various attenuation prediction techniques and actual measured attenuation, effects of site diversity at 15.3 GHz, and coherent bandwidth at 31. 65 GHz. Preliminary results are tabulated in Table 13-27. (31), (34), (36) Table 13-27. Preliminary Results Millimeter Wave Experiment Type Experiment Nature of Results Obtained 1) Attenuation at 15. 3 GHz 1 to 3 dB in light rains or dense fog, 3 to 7 dB in continuous rains (5 to 50 mm/hr) and number of fades exceeding 12 dB in heavy thunder­ storms. 2) Evaluation attenuation prediction techniques Excellent results using radiometer measurements* of sky temperature. Fair results employing radar back­ scatter readings at millimeter wave frequency. -Better results at lower frequencies. Poor results using rain gage measurements of rainfall rate. Results improved with more gages over greater area. 3) Effects site diversity at 15.3 GHz Durations of 6 to 10 dB fades reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude using simple diversity system with 4 km ground separation between terminals. 4) Coherent bandwidth at 31. 65 GHz Measured relative amplitude variations of sidebands have been within +2 dB of carrier for sidebands at ±1. +10, and +L50 MHz. *Operating at same frequency as propagation link. 13-52 For the L-Band experiment, the spacecraft spin produced about a 22 ms sample time during which the received signal was within 1 dB of peak.

The impact of the spinning spacecraft upon the original experiment objectives was that: a) all satellite loop tests had to be performed using a sampling technique that was synchronized to the spacecraft spin rate; b) the earth station AGC time constant had to be small compared to variations in the received signal to allow maximization of the sample time; c) fading at rates.greater than about one half the sampling rate, but not as great as those that could be observed in one sampling interval, were impossible to record; and d) FDM two-way voice or multiple access voice demonstrations could not be completed. The tests were completed and their results are summarized in Table 13-28. (32) The results indicated that accurate navigation and high quality communications are feasible at L-Band. However, more data may be required to allow refined system designs. 13. 3. 6 Operational Results ATS-2, 4, and 5 were experimental satellites, therefore, no operational traffic was carried. Operation of C-Band, L-Band and millimeter wave terminals was quite satisfactory. Spacecraft operation, in the case of ATS-4, was very limited and all equipment appeared to be performing well. On ATS-2 and 5, however, operations were more extensive and some anomalies were encountered. The anomalies on ATS-2 included a missing and a broken stabilization boom, unplanned environmental measurements package turnoffs, inadvertent gravity gradient regulator turnoffs, and an inability tb retract gravity gradient booms. The missing and broken booms were the result of the whipping action produced by spacecraft tumbling.

The missing and broken booms were the result of the whipping action produced by spacecraft tumbling. The equipment turnoffs were determined to be due to low battery voltage caused by poor spacecraft aspect angle relative to the sun. No significant problems resulted from the turnoffs. The inability to retract booms was theorized to be due to boom motion preventing a smooth entrance into the rollers of the retraction mechanism. 13-53 Type Experiment 1) Spacecraft Antenna Patterns 2) L Band Propagation Pon 3) Spacecraft Oscillator Frequency.Offset 4) Spacecraft Intermodula- tion Distortion (SSB/FM) 5) Spacecraft Transponder Compression (FM/FM) 6) Spacecraft SSB/FM Modu- lator Linearity A 7) Spacecraft Frequency Response 8) Doppler Due to Spacecraft Spin 9) Multiplex Channel S/N (SSB/FM) 10) Spin Modulation Com- pensation Test Table 13-28.

S/N decreased linearly with decrease in SSB transmitter power By modulating uplink power in synchronism with spacecraft spin and such as to compensate for variations in satellite receive antenna pattern, usable uplink window was increased from 52 ms to 100 ms * At Mojave terminal. The only significant operational difficulties encountered on ATS-5 have involved the primary and backup millimeter wave transmitters. (35), (36) The main transmitter functioned perfectly during the first 3 months in orbit. On November 22, 1969, however, the output power was down 6 dB at turn-on. This condition continued until December 17 when a further 3 dB loss was recorded. Transmitter power has remained stable at this level to the present writing. The dc input power has shown no change from pre-launch level during this entire time. Further the 30. 6 GHz local oscillator power has shown no significant change. This indicates that the loss is occurring in the solid state multiplier chain above the L-Band portion where the receiver local oscillator power is coupled out.

This indicates that the loss is occurring in the solid state multiplier chain above the L-Band portion where the receiver local oscillator power is coupled out. The exact location and cause of the failure has not been determined. The backup millimeter wave transmitter showed normal power characteristics from launch until October 22, 1969. The transmitter output power was then observed to decrease over time periods as short as 2-1/2 hours and as long as 9 hours to a level between 3 and 4 dB below normal output at which time the output abruptly dropped to zero. A period of nonoperation has always restored the transmitter to normal output. A loss in dc input power that correlates with the loss of RF output power has been recorded. It has been evident that the thermal sensitivity of the transmitter is responsible for the power loss. 13.3.6.1 Additional Services ATS-5 The NASA/GSFC L-band ranging and position location experiments, conducted from the Mojave ground station to the ATS-5 satellite, demonstrated the ability to obtain meaningful range measurements using PM tone modulation at L-band carrier frequencies. This experiment demonstrated the capability of obtaining ranging measurements between an earth station and the ATS-5 satellite at L-band and C-band carrier frequencies, and to evaluate the relative accuracy to which these measure­ ments can be made. Applied Information Industries (AI) conducted the Alpha II Project for SAMSO, U.S. Air Force, by doing simultaneous L-and C-band ranging using ATS-5. AlI also 13-55 performed a ranging test for the Maritime Administration using the tanker, USS Man­ batten. This test was basically a ranging test to determine line-of-position of the ship.

The TT;f aboard the ship was unattended and running continuously. Among the other tests and experiments that have been conducted are the iono­ spheric propagation tests, an on-going experiment involving three ground stations at Quito, Lima, and Mojave that accepted fading and fading rate data from ATS-5 on L-band and VHF simultaneously; the Federal Aeronautics-Administration/Boeing Air­ craft Company experiment at L-band from ATS-5 to an aircraft involving measurements of multipath effects and tone ranging; the millimeter wave experiment conducted by Westinghouse for GSFC concerning the propagation correlation with rain, fading, and weather conditions at 31. 65-GHz uplink and 15 3-GHz downlink; and the AII/Wallops Island experiment in relative position (ranging).

An additional year of operation is expected as a result of fuel saving at launching. Associated with NASA In the Applications Technology Satellite-6 mission are the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Federation of Rocky Mountain States, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Veterans' Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Maritime Administration, the National Library of Medi­ cine, the Indian Health Service, the U. S. Coast Guard, Alaska, COMSAT Corporation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Universities of Washington, California, and Minnesota, the Canadian Government, the European Space Organization and, later, the Government of India. The new spacecraft will be used for the next several years to test a variety of new space communications concepts. These include direct broadcast of health and education television programs to small and simple ground receiving units in remote regions over a large geographical area; aeronautical and maritime communications, position-location, and traffic control techniques; and spacecraft tracking and data relay. 13-57 The ATS-6 (ATS-F prior to launch) carries equipment for more than 20 techno­ logical and scientific experiments, some of them international in scope. The experi- 0 ments to be performed are described in Section 13.4.5. No other spacecraft similar to the ATS-6 has ever been placed in orbit.

This 1,402 kilograms (3,090 pounds) spacecraft consists essentially of an Earth Viewing Module (EVM) connected to a deployable reflector antenna which measures 9 meters (30 feet) in diameter when deployed. Spacecraft control, communications and experi­ ment systems are located in the EVM. For its first year of operation, the ATS-6 will be located at 94 degrees west longitude over the equator. At this location, a point over the Galapagos Islands, the spacecraft will be in view of all of the continental U. S. from its geosynchronous altitude of some 35,888 kilometers (22,300 miles). Shortly after the spacecraft is on this station and checked out, it will be used along with the ATS-1 and ATS-3 now in orbit to conduct the Health-Education Tele­ communications (HET) experiment which encompasses both educational and two-way medical tele-conferencing experiments. The HET experiments are planned in three geographic areas: the Rocky Moun­ tain region, the Appalachian states, and the states of Washington and Alaska. HET will pioneer delivery of high quality educational and health services to millions of Americans in remote parts of these areas. For the HET experiment, the ATS-6 will be able to relay two separate color TV signals, each accompanied by four voice channels. Thus, programs can be broadcast in several languages simultaneously with the viewer being able to select English, Spanish, or one of several American Indian dialects. The ATS-1 and ATS-3 space­ craft will be used for two-way voice and data transmissions in support of the ATS-6 during both educational and health-medical experiments.

Approximately one year after launch, the ATS-6 will be moved eastward to 350 east longitude which is over the eastern edge of Lake Victoria, located in Kenya, East Africa. From this position, the spacecraft will be \"visible\" to the subcontinent 13-58 1 * of India. It will then be used by the Indian Government 4 hours a day for 1 year to conduct the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE). For SITE, ATS-6 will be used to broadcast instructional and educational tele­ vision programs to 5000 villages and cities in seven states throughout India. About 2400 villages will receive the programs directly from ATS-6 using small, low-cost ground stations. The remaining 2600 villages will be located near rediffusion trans­ mitting stations and will receive the programs using conventional VHF television sets. Programs will stress improved agricultural techniques, family planning and hygiene, school instruction and teacher education; and occupational skills. Because of the large number of languages and dialects spoken in India, each video channel will be accompanied by two audio channels in different languages. In mid-July, 1975 the ATS-6 will be used to track and relay TV and other data from the Apollo-Soyuz spacecraft as they orbit the earth in a 10-day joint U. S. -U. S. S.

It was designed and built for Fairchild Space and Electronics Company by Philco-Ford Corporation's Western Development Laboratories Division in Palo Alto, California. The communications system will operate over an unusually broad range of UHF, VHF, L-band, S-band and C-band frequencies--about 17 in all, ranging from 136 MHz to 6 GHz. The system also provides monopulse signals which are used by the space­ * craft for attitude stabilization. The system receives up to three signals simultane­ ously and can transmit one or a combination of these on any of the assigned frequencies. 13-59 12 FEET) SOLAR PANELMNT o 9ENVROMENTAR( Ll REFLECTO ANTENNA V\"F ffaFLEETRY ON FESM TIt conuwlcyamuomaaFl EARTh VIEWNG M OUt1iLEL lREFRLECTfO mOULE Figure 13-13.

For PLACE, a special multiple access capability is provided for simultaneous C-band to L-band and iL-band to C-band operation. The receiver linearity is such that received multiple carriers do not produce significant intermodulation components. The received multiple carriers are translated to baseband and then phase modulated. onto a single carrier. Baseband information bandwidth is 1.5 kHz to 1.5 MHz. Auto­ matic gain control maintains the phase modulation at a 0. 85-radian rms independent of the number of carriers. In performing the data relay experiment, simultaneous S-band to C-band and C-band to S-band operation is provided. Also the C-band to S-band signal can be repeated on C-band.

Also the C-band to S-band signal can be repeated on C-band. (41) Signals for the satellite instructional television experiment are received at C-band and simultaneously transmitted on UHF and C-band. The UHF transmission is for the primary experimental use while the C-band signal can be monitored at ground stations geographically remote from the area covered by the UHF beam. For the wideband signals used in the millimeter wave experiments, the C-band receiver is used with a demodulator which is essentially flat from 30 Hz to 5 MHz. Signals from the very high resolution radiometer are used to frequency modu­ late the C-band transmitter. The VCO used to generate the FM signal is extremely linear (±1%) in order to minimize distortion of the radiometer information. In order to assist ground stations in directing the high-gain antennas toward the ATS spacecraft, a CW C-band radio beacon signal is transmitted upon command in the earth coverage mode. A monopulse mode is implemented in the C-band frequency range for determin­ ing the attitude of the spacecraft in roll and pitch with an accuracy of about ±0.30. This signal can be fed directly to the attitude control system and to the telemetry system for transmission to ground stations. The communication subsystem also provides C-band transmission for signals derived from the RFI experiment. A two-channel TV transmit capability in the 13-70 2.5 to 2.69 GHz band will be supplied by the communications subsystem for the ETV experiment.

(41) 13.4.3.1 Antennas- The antennas used with the communications system are located in two areas: (1) the prime focus feed, on the top surface of the EVM, which illuminates the 9­ meter (30-foot) parabolic reflector, and (2) the earth viewing horns on the bottom sur­ face of the EVM that receive and transmit signals directly to and from the earth. Figure 13-16 shows the antenna layout on the top surface. Figure 13-17 shows the bottom view of the subsystem. The antennas connected with the Radio Beacon and interferometer experiments are not shown, on 'Figure 13-17. The composite feed assembly shown in Figure 13-16 is used in conjunction with the reflector to provide efficient antenna performance over a broad range of fre­ quencies and a wide variety of beam shapes, sizes, and functions. Although individual feed elements are used for each frequency band to permit optimum performance, a great deal of commonality exists among the radiating elements. To satisfy polariza­ tion, weight, and size requiremeits, cavity-backed cross-dipole elements are used for S, L, and UHF feeds. These elements offer simple and reliable radiators capable of operating at the frequency bandwidths, and polarizations defined-by the experi­ ments. With the exception of VHF radiators, the feed layout enables placement of all radiating elements in the parabola's focal plane, and minimizes interaction between neighboring feeds. 13.4.3.2 Physical Description The components that comprise the communications subsystem are located in the uppermost section of the EVM.

Support­ ing these major areas are the RF input/output circuitry, wideband data unit, mono­ pulse detector, command distributor, and dc-dc converters. Figure 13-18 shows the signal interfaces. - The receiver includes preamplifiers, monopulse modulators, mixers, filters and the required interconnecting circuits. The IF amplifier consists of an IF input switch matrix,; three identical IF am­ plifiers (f. = 150 MHz, Af = 40 MHz or 12 MHz, on command and an IF output switch matrix). The synthesizer uses a single- frequency (100 MHz) oscillator from which-it synthesizes all the other desired frequencies. It can operate in the coherent mode, wherein the VOC and all the frequencies derived from it are phase-locked to the re­ ceived signal. In the noncoherent mode a temperature compensated crystal oscillator acts as the reference. The transmitter portion of the transponder is comprised of the up-converter, the drivers and the power amplifiers for C-band, S-band, and L-band. Tables 13-34 through 13-38 give the signal interfaces, and the expected perform­ ance of the transponder.

One station is located at Rosman, North Carolina and two are collocated at the Mojave site on Goldstone dry lake near Barstow, California. One is a fixed terminal like Rosman and the other is the transportable Hybrid Terminal. The Hy­ brid Terminal will consist of elements from the ATS Mobile Terminal and the Trans­ portable Ground Station (TGS) which was used in Australia during ATS 1-5 operations. It will initially be operated with ATS-6 while located at.Mojave -and then moved over­ seas several months after launch. The Mobile Terminal can be separated from the Hybrid Terminal to provide an RF link when it is desired to remotely locate experi­ menter's equipment. In either configuration the Hybrid or Mobile Terminals will contain UHF equipment to support the 860-MHz downlink for the SITE experiment.

The two secondary stations, Mojave-and the Hybrid Terminal, will have the same basic capabilities as the primary station with regard to performance and evaluation of space­ craft data. The three stations will have functionally identical communications and 13-81 telemetry and control equipment; 'the principal difference being that the stations have different C-band antennas. The Rosman facility will use a 26-meter (85-fdot) an­ tenna; the Mojave facility will use a 12-meter (40-foot) antenna and the Hybrid/ Mobile Terminal will use a 6.4-meter (21-foot) antenna which contains a UHF feed to provide the UHF receive capability. The millimeter wave experiment unique terminal will be located at the ATS facility at Rosman. All spacecraft maneuvers and experiments are controlled by direction from the ATS Operations Control Center (ATSOCC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. All test data obtained is forwarded from the ground stations to GSFC for processing, evaluation, and distribution to experimenters. 13.4.4.2 Rosman Ground Station(4 1) The Rosman II 26-meter (85-foot) antenna is used by ATS-6 spacecraft for C-band transmission and reception. This high-gain antenna with its feed and low­ noise receiver systems provides a relatively quick conversion from space flight tracking and data network to ATS communications use, and vice versa. This allows the antenna to be shared with other projects. Monopulse tracking techniques can be used to automatically track the spacecraft. Polarization tracking at C-band is also provided.

In addition, a communications test and eval­ uation console (CTEC) is used for evaluation of the spacecraft communications link. A master control console (MCC) provides a focal point for ground station co­ ordination. At the MCC, the mission director receives status indications and infor­ mation that enable him to direct operations by issuing voice commands to the subsystem operators. Spacecraft commands are encoded, transmitted and verified by the T&C subsys­ tem.

The terminal is composed of the Mobile Terminal (less power generation equipment), three personnel vans, and the T&C, ATS-R and computer trailers from the trans­ portable ground station. Two of these trailers have removable sides so that, when on site, they can be mated together side by side to form a single complete operation control complex (000) with access to all subsystems, with the exception of T&C. The T&0 system is contained in a separate trailer. This system, which is basically the same for all of the ground stations, is integrated with the 000 so that overall 13-84 control of the station can be maintained from one point. Spacecraft commands are encoded, transmitted and verified by therT&C system. Spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and discrete real-time functions are also received, processed, recorded and displayed by the telemetry subsystem. The station master control console, from which all monitoring and control func­ tions are handled, is located in the attached trailers.

After the HEW ATS-F User Policy Committee established the types and characteristics of terminals to be developed, the detailed specifications were written jointly by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Conmmica­ tions, NASA, and the Federation of Rocky Mountain States. A \"rbuilding block\" philosophy was adopted which would permit \"receive-only,\" \"intensive,\" and \"corn­ prehensive\" stations to be assembled from the basic development components. It was envisioned from the outset that these stations would be designed for operation solely by the health professionals and teachers. It Wvas inconceivable that the system could be cost effective in remote areas if it were necessary to have on hand a full­ time technician. The following are characteristics of the hardware: 1. Solid state throughout 2. No high voltages in the equipment 3. Relatively few circuit boards so that first level maintenance would con­ sist of plugging in boards until the defective one is found 13-88 4. Very few switches and adjustments 5.

They will also be able to request and receive specialized reference information via satel­ lite. In the Rocky Mountains, junior-high students will have a'wcourse in career education, and adults will have some evening programs on topics of interest to them.

In 1971, the Commission surveyed 32, 000 public-school teachers in Appalachia and learned that in-service training, particularly in the teaching of read­ ing and career education, was needed. The Commission, with selected Regional Education Service Agencies (RESAs), and the University of Kentucky are participating in the satellite project. This summer, the University of Kentucky will offer to elementary-school teachers, via satellite, two graduate-level three-credit courses through the 15 se­ lected RESAs. One course will be in career education; the other, the teaching of elementary reading. The system, will work-as follows: the 15 RESAs have been divided into five groups of three each.

This enables the programmers to respond instan­ taneously to and participate in the actual programming. Participants at one Intensive Site will be able to- communicate simultaneously both with Denver and with partici­ pants at other Intensive Sites. One of the key features of the demonstration, this capability will be studied for its implications on future educational and telecommuni­ cations activities. The other 32 rural schools, as well as the 12 PBS stations, are designated Receive-Only Terminals. They will receive the same radio and color TV signals as the Intensive Sites, but will not have two-way capability. The STD also will originate adult, community-oriented programming to the 56 participating rural schools one evening every third week, focusing on subjects of concern discovered in surveys of the communities.

This information will have further appli­ cation to studies of the steady-state shape of earth. All the tracking and data relay information collected will be valuable for the future transition from a totally ground based tracking system to a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (T&DRSS) under investigation for the late 1970s. This system would employ two synchronous orbit spacecraft to relay command, tracking, and telemetry data between a few centrally located groimnd stations and multiple spacecraft in low earth orbit. Extensive networks of tracking stations have been established around the world in present tracking techniques to obtain relatively complete global tracking coverage for low-orbit spacecraft. Such networks are costly in terms of the instrumentation and the manpower involved in the operation. Also, because of the geographical 13-114 location of the stations, these networks are unable to provide adequate coverage of spacecraft in some orbits. The T&DRSS would help solve many of these problems. Such a system could perform many of the key functions of the ground-based tracking stations, thus reduc­ ing the instrumentation and manpower requirements. In addition, each synchronous­ orbit spacecraft in the tracking system would be able to track a particular spacecraft for a much longer period of time than an earth-based station. This would reduce the difficulties involved in sequential tracking by multiple ground stations. For either the Nimbus-F or the GEOS-C experiment, ATS-6 will be commanded first by the ATS ground station at Rosman, N, C., to point at and lock onto one of the spacecraft orbiting beneath it.

(42) The R&RR system uses a series of tones to modulate an RF carrier; the modu­ lated carrier is transmitted from the ground station to ATS-6, then down to Nimbus, up to ATS-6, and then back down to the ground station. The phase delay and doppler shift of the returning signal yields the total four-way range and cumulative range rate over the signal path from which the orbit of Nimbus can be determined. The trans­ mission link between the ATS spacecraft and the ground is at C-Band; between the ATS and Nimbus spacecraft S-Band signals are employed. (44) _ T&DRE design objectives for uncertainties in raw tracking data are 4.0 meters in range and 0.6 centimeters/s in range rate. Based on the availability of long-arc tracking data, studies have shown that it should be possible to determine the Nimbus orbit to within 50. meters in a total elapsed time of several hours. This constitutes a substantial improvement over ground-based tracking systems which typically require days and weeks of data processing to determine orbits which at best are known only to within hundreds of meters. Verification of these theoretical studies is considered the major scientific and application goal of the T&DRE. (44) Figure 13-29 illustrates this experiment.

(42) To accomplish the second objective, that of developing the technology and demon­ strating the feasibility of a data relay system, data from Nimbus will be relayed via ATS-6. The data transmission capacity of the Nimbus to ATS-6 link is determined by the power of the transmitter and antenna gain available on the Nimbus spacecraft; this capacity is more than sufficient to provide highly reliable transmissions of nor­ mal 4 kbps data from Nimbus to the ground via ATS-6. To perform a more meaning­ ful evaluation of T&DRE return link performance, test data will be transmitted at rates of 50, 100, 200, and 400 kbps. 'Signal detection at the ATS ground station will be done using a high-performance carrier tracking phase demodulator which will track the residual carrier component of the transmitted signal under all system doppler conditions.

Two separate RFI experiments are planned, one at C-band and the other at VHF. (39) 13-117 For this experiment, ATS-6's 9.1-meter (30-foot) parabolic antenna will be used to collect microwave IF signals in the 5925 to 6425 MHz frequency bands that reach the synchronous-orbit altitude from earth. These signals will-be transmitted to a wide­ band RFI transponder (500 MHz) onboard the spacecraft, automatically converted to a 4 MHz signal, and relayed to the ATS ground station at Rosman, N. C. At Rosman the signals will be fed to a computerized receiver analyzer for initial data processing and recording prior to delivery to Goddard for final analysis.

Initially, ATS-F will scan the entire U.S. to identify \"hot spots\" of RFI. Then a narrow band analytical system will be used to determine the frequency, power level, and the geographic location of each area of interference.

The reference NPR measurements will be made using the earth coverage (low gain) antenna of the satellite with the main beam of the high gain 9-meter (30-foot) antenna pointed to a quiet spot on the earth. In order to relate the inter­ ference levels to the wanted-to-unwanted, signal ratios (C/X), the -system carrier-to­ noise and baseband signal-to-noise ratios will also be measured. The main beam of the high gain antenna will then be pointed toward a high density population area such as the northeastern coastal region of the United States and the measurement technique repeated. This set of measurements now contains both the simulated desired signals (and basic noise) plus the real (unwanted) noise signals from all earth sources within the field of view of both satellite antennas. These unwanted noise signals, sharing the same common carrier frequency as the simulated system, can now be determined by remeasuring the system NPR, carrier-to-noise, and baseband signal-to-noise 13-118 ratios. The measurements will be repeated to determine the interference noise levels as a function of source latitude, frequency, and time.

These signals will be scanned and applied to the data acquisition section which calculates the power of each carrier signal and records it on magnetic tape. These magnetic tape recordings can be processed on any large computer and displayed on a teletypewriter to permit a sta­ tistical comparison between the measured attenuation at a site and general meteoro­ logical parameters such as rainfall rate, number of thunderstorm days, and total precipitation.

This experiment is expected to lay the necessary foundation for the development of future ground-based spacecraft control systems which would perform many of the essential functions now performed onboard the spacecraft. As a result, reliability could be improved because the ground-base systems could be repaired, or replaced in case of malfunction. Further, the weight and space savings resulting from smaller onboard control systems could be used for redundant or improved power and sensor systems. Future ground-based control systems could provide more versatility in that new tasks could be programmed and performed as requirements or technology changed. Principal Investigator: William C.

(I ) A series of prior successful satellite developments and experiments in the Lincoln Experimental Satellite Program (see Section 9) led to a contract in January 1967 for the development of a prototype ver­ sion of an operational shtellite, the Tactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT). Specific objectives of the Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) pro­ as listed in Table 14-1.(2)(3)(4)gram were Table 14-1. TACSATCOM Objectives Number Description 1 Develop, test, and experiment with space and surface hardware in UHF and SHE bands. 2 Develop, demonstrate, and evaluate operational concepts for use with many mobile tactical ter­ minals. These include problems of multiple access and power control. 3 Provide UHF voice link between the Apollo spacecraft and recovery aircraft, ships, and ground stations. An active repeater satellite was launched into a geostationary orbit (Table 14-2) and positioned over the United States. A successful testing program was conducted using this satellite, called TACSAT 1. The experiments involved a number of mobile terminals, specifically developed for the program, that can be divided into UHF and SHF types and subdivided by platform type. These are listed in Table 14-3.(5)(6) In addition, various other existing terminals were used for the TACSATCOM experiments. TACSATCOM is no longer a functioning system. TACSAT I provided service until 14-1 December 1972. Its 3-3/4 years of active life represented a longer period than that originally planned for experimental and operational testing. Up to the present there are no definite plans for a TACSAT 2, and it appears that Tactical Satellite Communications development will continue for the time being by the three services under their individual programs; for example, FLTSATCOM.

Attitude control and stationkeeping produced changes. The design of TACSAT 1 represented some major advances in spacecraft tech­ nology. It was a prototype for new high power communication satellites as well as a test vehicle for tactical communications. Features included use of the gyrostat stabi­ lization principle (allowing more flexibility in spacecraft design), more complex re­ peater design, a newly developed 20-watt SHF TWT, and developments in load-bearing solar panels. The design of families of UHF and SHF earth terminals based on exten­ sive coimonality of equipment represented another advancement. The feasibility of UHF and SHF communications through a synchronous satellite by small mobile earth terminals was demonstrated. Use of the tactical transmission system (TATS) frequency-hopping modem for multiple access and overcoming multipath interference was also demonstrated and the attendant problem areas investigated. 14-2 Table 14-3.

The TACSAT 1 spacecraft was designed to operate in a variety of modes to accommodate the planned tests with terminals of different capabilities. Functionally, the communi­ cations subsystem consisted of a UHF frequency translating repeater and an SHF fre­ quency translating repeater, each capable of operating with selectable bandwidths from UHF to SHF and from SHF to UHF. The modes were under control of commands transmitted by-the satellite control ground station. In keeping with the concept of mobile terminal simplicity, the satellite performed system frequency control by transmitting UHF and SHF beacon signals for use as references for all transmit and receive function frequencies generated at the terminals, and for antenna pointing. Table 14-4 shows the operating frequency bands at UHF and SHF for communica­ tion and T and C purposes. Table 14-4.

Dat~a Book The SHF band had four modes of operation, although all ground terminals could not use all modes. The modes were frequeficy modulation for voice or data:' TATS, DPSK, and broadcast alert. Table 14-6 presents the signal-processing techniques utilized in each mode. 14.3 SPACECRAFT Characteristics of the TACSAT 1 communications subsystem ate described in Table 14-7. A block diagram of the communications repeater is shown in Figure 14-3. There are eight ground commandable modes corresponding to the four filter bandwidths at each frequency band. Two of the modes represent cross-coupled operation between the UHF and SHF repeaters. TACSAT 1 was the first U. S. spacecraft stabilized with gyrostat technology.(4) This means that the satellite does not have to be spun about its maximum moment of in­ ertia design constraints. The spacecraft consisted of a large spinning cylinder within which was mounted a cone-shaped structure. A bearing assembly attached to the cone structure supported, on its housing, a despun platform containing antennas and communications and telemetry equipment. The spinning section contained solar cells, batteries, auxiliary telemetry, tracking, and command equipment, despin control electronics, the hydrogen peroxide propulsion system, and the nitrogen spinup system.

A pendulum liquid damper was used for nutation damping. The intent of the program was to provide experimental hardware for testing tac­ tical satellite communications and, therefore, to be conservative in the spacecraft development approach. Space-proven technology was used wherever possible. How­ ever, the satellite requirements could not be met without some major advances in spacecraft technology. These included: use of the gyrostat stabilizing concept; intri­ cacy of the repeater design; use of beryllium within the structure; development of a new 20-watt TWT; and development of load-bearing solar panels. 14-7 Table 14-6.

The narrow-band channel was downcon­ verted to a band around 16. 6 MHz, hard-limited and then coupled to the various filters. A ground commandable mode selection switch routed the desired channel output to the UHF transmitter. The SHE received signal level varied from -150 to -85 dBW. The signal was downconverted to a band around 92.5 MHz. This signal was split into two paths, one of which was amplified in the 10-MHz channel and limited. The signal in the other path was downconverted to a band around 16. 6 MHz for the SHF narrow-band channel modes. A ground commandable mode selection switch routed the desired channel output to the SHF transmitter. 14.4 EARTH TERMINALS Two families of tactical terminals were developed for use in the two TACSAT frequency bands as listed in Table 14-3. Each family employed considerable common­ ality of equipment with terminal-specific equipment mainly in the categories of antenna, preamplifier, transmitter, and number and types of modems. Figures 14-4 and 14-5 show block diagrams of the UHF and SHF terminals, with all the possible modes of op­ eration in each frequency band included. As discussed previously, the satellite beacons at UHF and SHF were used as fre­ quency references for all ground terminals.

The technical experiments investigated satellite and ground terminal performance characteristics and system performance characteristics with the Various modems employed singly and under multiple-access conditions. The operational exper­ iments evaluated TACSATCOM performance during armed force operational exercises. In addition, there were various special tests employing TACSAT-1. It was originally intended that technical experiments be performed before opera­ tional experiments but late equipment delivery necessitated that the two types be performed concurrently in some cases.

The operational experiments, conducted by the Navy, were termed a Fleet Operational Investigation (FOI) and were intended to investigate tactical concepts, operating procedures, and techniques. These overlapped, to some degree, technical experiments but were intended to determine effects of operationally imposed factors. The followiiig categories of operational experiments were established: 1. Multiple-access capability 2. Operational techniques and procedures 3. Environmental influences on operational characteristics 4. Special purpose operational applications The specific experiments were of three types: teletype, voice, and simul­ taneous voice and teletype 14-14 Table 14-8.

Nature Of Results Obtained At M no degredation above 100 eleva­ tion angle. At lower angles signal deteriorated but data was obtained to at least 40. At SH? no representativedata is available. All test results agreed closely with theoretically predicted values or equipment specifications. Ground, ship nd submarine antennas performed well. Data was obtained on performance of various antenna designs for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters Basically the terminals performed with­ in nominal limits and met most of the electrical and mechanical requirements. Shipboard UHF terminals had consider­ ably higher noise temperatures (up to 200 0OK) than other UHF terminals (below 10000K). Both the UHF and SHF FM voice links performed satisfactorily and had suf­ficient system margin. Under stable conditions modem perfor­ mance via satellite is within 1dB (as determined by Eb/Novs error rate) of back-to-back performance., Interference appears to be unavoidable in 10MHZ band­ width UHF uplink and is present in 500 %Hz UHF band at times. Variations along the radio-wave propagation path also contribute to variations of several dB. In general, the tests demonstrated the capability of the TATs modem to operate satisfactorily with a aircraft Communic tion system including its aultzpath environment.

When using blade antenna modem lost lock dur­ 2ng 360-degree turns and with aircraft heading directly away from sub-satellite point. Using reference data base antenna system gain vs. elevation angle was calculated for the two onboard antennas. Unexpectedly poor performance was noted during several of the runs using the satellite relay. No, results are report­ ed for tests using the satellite. Back­ to-back tests which eliminate on-orbit signal fluctuation, intermodulation, and possibly interference were perfor­ med. They gave information on limita­tions in use of address codes to pre­vent false acquisition and maintain adequate link margin. The 1-MHZ satellite bandwidth was used with carriers spaced 505kHz apart. This resulted in spectrum overlap and test results showed that the present system will not support 6-channel PCM. 14-18 Successful communications were maintained during typical maneuvers such as helicopter operations from a ship, destroyer maneuvers, aircraft launch and recovery operations aboard a carrier, and orbit of a C-130 aircraft. The FM voice mode was of high quality and very reliable. Secure digitized voice was more cumbersome and less reliable and intelligible than FM voice, but provided a high level of security. Secure teletype communication was excellent, provided synchronization was achieved. The probability of achieving synchronization was not as high as desired, due to some incompatibility between.the TATS modem and the cryptographic equipment.

Complete random access to the satellite repeater is complicated by the necessity to control the uplink power of the users. Joint Service Monitor/Control experiments were performed to determine tradeoffs involved between a system that is too costly or unreliable (no control) and a system that operationally is too restrictive in use (com­ plete control). The experiments were conducted using the TACSAT UHF mode. The primary control concept allowed complete random access for all 75-bps TTY, TATS users and for all alert message users subject only to EIRP restrictions. All other communications modes had to obtain prior approval from the real-time monitor/control agency before accessing the satellite. A schedule of priorities in user communication modes. was set up, and each service was allocated a portion of the satellite EIRP for nonrandom access communication modes. For power control, all UHF terminals were allowed one of two radiated power magnitudes, depending on the receiving and trans­ mitting antenna gains. Experimental results were obtained that will be useful in the design of an operational system. The development of different modulation and multiple-access techniques led to an investigation of the capability and compatibility of simultaneous use of different tech­ niques. One experiment involved simultaneous use of TATS and FM/FDM with the TACSAT 500-kHz bandwidth UHF mode. Only certain TATS codes were used such that the .TATS signal energy did not fall in a selected portion (81. 6 kHz wide) of the repeater bandwidth. This allowed use of FM channels one through seven. Twelve low data rate 14-19 TATS at 18 dBW per access, two high data rate TATS at 29 dBW per access, and three FM'accesses at 31 dBW per access were used.

Results showed a C/kT of 59 dB for the FM accesses and a test tone plus noise-to-noise ratio of 26 dB. Members of the Avionics Laboratory of the ECOM conducted digital data trans­ mission, tests with TACSAT, using the TATS modem and the UHF-equipped helicopter. The purpose was to determine the effects of the helicopter environment on the capability of the TACSAT 1 system to relay digital data that could be extrapolated to simulate air traffic control data. The power level was varied in steps and the digital error rates recorded. Air­ craft engines and rotor and aircraft heading all affected the error rate versus power level. However, the results showed that with sufficiently high transmitted power levels no errors occurred. A series of tests using the USS Independence and NELC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of establishing automatic digital data links between remotely located par­ ticipants. The technical feasibility of transferring real-time ASW operational display data to and from a computer-equipped P-3 aircraft and a ground-based computer terminal was demonstrated. The experiment was performed at UHF, and the modulation was 2400-bps because the TATS modems were unavailable. A two-way UHF-TDM communication mode used for air traffic control and car­ rier landing operated successfully through the TACSAT 1 repeater. Vocoder voice word intelligibility experiments using the TATS modem were conducted using TACSAT 1.

Functions, such as addressing of members and as­ signment of channels, were performed by a computer installed at the net control station 14-20 in Bedford, Massachusetts. Automatic Net Control units were installed at ground­ based terminals and Eastern Test Range C-i35 aircraft. Although the experiments were considered preliminary and additional work re­ mains, the results showed that automatic polling significantly improved traffic flow in star nets. Experiments with terminals located in Panama were performed to determine the effect of tropical environment, particularly attenuation due to foliage, on UHF and SHI communications. The average attenuation at UHF in foliage was about 8 dB. At SHF no signal acquisition was obtained in the foliage. There were equipment problems di­ rectly related to temperature and humidity. 14.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS One of the objectives of the TACSATCOM program was the support of Apollo mis­ sions. TACSAT 1 was used to support Apollo missions 10 through 13 in the following capacities. 1. Command and control of the Apollo Range Instrumentation Aircraft while enroute and at their staging bases. 2. Astronaut voice relay from the spacecraft to Mission Control Center in Houston during orbit, translunar injection burn, and recovery operations. 3.

Communications during all operational phases were outstanding. In addition, the TACSAT SHE communication band was used to provide satellite relay of live television coverage of the moon landing from the continental United States to Alaska. A modified army SHF terminal in Anchorage, Alaska, was used for this purpose. 14-21 After termination of the formal test program and special operations described above, TACSAT 1 was used for actual operational military circuits until December 1972. From launch to December 1972 (when active use of the TACSAT 1 ceased), all major satellite subsystems performed well with two exceptions: a nutation, anomaly ahd a drop in UHF ERP. It was found that the nutation angle, instead of decaying after sep­ aration, maintained a fairly steady level of about 1 degree. The nutation disappeared eventually but reappeared at intervals. A study indicated that certain rotor destabiliz­ ing forces were much larger than anticipated. These can be decreased by minor changes in the design of future spacecraft. The nutation angle is not large enough to affect communication system performance. The UHF ERP dropped after several months from 38.4 dBW to 35.4 dBW ± 2 dB with erratic variation about the mean. In addition, the transmitting antenna pattern changed significantly. Laboratory tests demonstrated that all the phenomena observed could have been caused by a short circuit to the ground plane or an open circuit on the first turn of any of the four outer helix antennas.

In addition, there were three component failures, none of which affected system operation; one of the four earth sensors behaved erratically, one of the redundant de­ coders of the TT and C subsystem produced extraneous outputs at times,jand one SHF TWT suffered a reduced power level, probably due to helix current changes caused by temperature sensitivity. The UHF terminals developed for the TACSATCOM program were considered as advanced development models, while the SHF terminals were considered as feasibility models. Basically, the terminals met most of the electrical and mechanical require­ ments. The UHF equipment was fairly reliable, but the reliability of the SHF terminals and the TATS modem designed for TACSATCOM use were not as high as desired. 14-22 CITED REFERENCES 1. Statement of Maj.

During 1963 and 1964 subsequent studies proceeded toward a goal of choosing an optimum system. Meanwhile, the U.S. was planning the deployment of its Interim Defense Satellite Communication System (IDSCS).. The U.S. intended to devote the first year of IDSCS to testing, and the U.K. was invited to participate in the test phase. The U.K. program to participate in the IDSCS testing consisted of building five earth stations and work began on these stations in 1965."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__478", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 478, "text": "Satellite Communication System (IDSCS).. The U.S. intended to devote the first year of IDSCS to testing, and the U.K. was invited to participate in the test phase. The U.K. program to participate in the IDSCS testing consisted of building five earth stations and work began on these stations in 1965. Three, with 12-meter (40-foot) dishes, were designed by Marconi, Ltd., to have an operational capability within the SKYNET program. The fourth was designed and developed by the Admirality Surface Weapons Establishment. This terminal was entirely experimental to test and confirm the basic design requirements for shipborne terminals. The fifth station ­ a mobile land terminal -was built by the Signals Research and Development Estab­ lishment. This terminal was also an experimental tool. The first Marconi station was completed in the middle of 1966, and the other four stations were all working and participating in testing before the end of that year. During the testing a large number of R&D tests -typically, measurements of propaga­ tion conditions, path loss, earth station performance, and experiments on advanced modulation techniques -were accomplished to aid in the design of the SKYNET System. In 1966 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the U.K. and the U.S. whereby the U.S. would build and launch two satellites required by the SKYNET Program. Philco-Ford was to build the satellites and the USAF Space and Missile System Organization (SAMSO), with technical support from the Aerospace Corpora­ tion, was to act as the procurement agent for the U.K. 15-1 Two satellites were to be launched in 1969-70, with one satellite acting as a backup for the other to provide a 5-year system capability.

SKYNET I \"A\" was suc­ cessfully launched into synchronous orbit in November 1969. SKYNET I \"B\" was launched in August 1970 and was a total loss when it failed to reach synchronous or­ bit. It was generally believed that the apogee kick motor used to circularize the­ orbit exploded. Table 15-1(1)(2)(3) summarizes launch and status information on the SKYNET satellites. Note that there is no SKYNET operational satellite at this time. The U.1K. is proceeding with the SKYNET II program which will consist of a larger spacecraft with a considerably higher EIRP. (20-watt TWT versus 3.'0-watt TWT.) The first attempt at launching a SKYNET II satellite in January 1974 resulted in a mission failure when the second stage of the Delta rocket misfired preventing achievement of a proper orbit. A second launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. The operational requirements dictated the use of nine earth stations, five of which were to be stationary and four mobile. The stationary stations are in the-U. K., Cyprus, Bahrain, Gan and Singapore. Although the stations are considered stationary, all stations with the exception of the U.K. station have been designed so that they can be moved if necessary. Two of the mobile stations are fitted in ships -the assault headquarters ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid. The last two stations are mobile stations ashore.

Table 15-3(2)(3) gives the frequencies of the two bands. Table 15-3. SKYNET Frequencies 2 MHz Channel (MHz) 20 MHz Channel (MHz) Beacon (MHz) Uplink 7976.02 to 7978.02 7985.12 to 8005.12 - Downlink 7257.30 to 7259.30 7266.40 to 7286.40 7299.50 With two independent bands, modulation and multiple access could be tailored to satisfy all system requirements. Other specified features to be included in the system were reliability of communications and flexibility in terms of interconnections and traffic. The requirements of SKYNET communications fix the choice of terminals. The satellite antenna pattern was designed for coverage from the United Kingdom in the West to Singapore in the East. The U.K. Is other areas of interest fall between these two extremes.

The satellite antenna pattern was designed for coverage from the United Kingdom in the West to Singapore in the East. The U.K. Is other areas of interest fall between these two extremes. Traffic requirements were telegraphy, speech, and medium speed data circuits. It was decided that the strategic system would be designed specifically for digital signals at rates of 75 x 2n bits per second (where n equals 1, 2, 4, or 5), and would use the 20-MHz channel. Once the digital philosophy was adopted, a telegraph time 15-5 division multiplex was developed, capable of assembling synchronous and nonsyn­ chronous telegraph signals into a single synchronous data stream. For the 20-MHz channel, Pseudo-Noise Spread Spectrum Multiple Access (PN/ SSMA) was chosen over FDMA, which eliminated the need for frequency planning. Additional advantages of this choice were: (1) PN/SSMA signals are virtually im.­ mune to intermodulation effects except for the small loss of useful power, and (2) inherent interference protection is provided. Figure 15-1(2)(10 ) indicates the PN/SSMA links established among the fixed terminals operated in the 20-MHz channel. Table 15-4(2) summarizes the typical link performance in the 20-MHz band. In the mobile terminal case, it was decided to use FDMA in the 2-MHz satel­ lite band. In addition, the 2-MHz channel was to be used to provide engineering tele­ type orderwire facilities between fixed stations. Figure 15-2(2) indicates the FM links to be established in the 2-MHz band. Link power limitations dictate that the mobile and shipborne terminals communicate only with a 12-meter (40-foot) station.

Table 15-5 (5)( 6)(9)gives the FM performance characteristics of the demodulators used by the mobile and shipborne terminals. Since communications reliability is of paramount importance, adequate link margins were allowed for unpredictable losses due to weather, misalignments and equipment degradation. Estimates of 2 dB for excess path attenuation and lO0 K for excess noise were used for earth stations in the U. K. and Singapore which are served by a suitably placed geostationary satellite. Losses were greater for an earth station with a radome because of the attenuation of a water film on the surface. Re' ductions in signal/noise ratios of up to 6 dB have been observed witha radome under wet conditions. Margins for both \"up\" and \"down\" links had to be allowed if a local rain squall were not to upset the power balance of the entire system.. 15.2.1 Control Subsystem.

Most electrical design features, Apart from redundancy, are commonly used with the, Type 11 station to simplify training and maintenance support. The Type I antenna is a 13-meter (42-foot) diameter parabolic reflector with a Cassegrain feed system mounted on a fully steerable azimuth elevation mount which is, installed on a three-legged gantry. Azimuth rotation is accomplished by two dc motors driving in a countertorque configuration to minimize backlash. The elevation drive consists of two mechanically coupled recirculating ball screws. The Type II antenna mount is fundamentally different. To meet the original air-transportability specification, a double-walled inflatable radome was used with a non-orthogonal mount. This mount allowed the antenna to be more readily de­ mounted into pieces of.a size suitable for the aircraft, and also produced a smaller swept volume than a standard azimuth-elevation mount, thus requiring a smaller radome. The profile of the Type I main and subreflectors has been shaped from the para­ boloid to ensure a nearly uniform illumination of the main reflector. With this tech­ nique, overall antenna efficiency and gain are increased. The composite four-horn feed consists of four horns, four circular polarizers and diplexers, transmit power dividers and static split combination networks. The Type I and Il station receiving systems are similar except that the system is duplicated in the Type I station, with a remotely controlled waveguide changeover 15-18 Table 15-8.

Figure 15-6 ( 4) is a simplified diagram of the essentials of the communications chain. The low noise receiver is preceded by a \"waffle-iron\" type low pass filter giving 93 dB of protection against the transmitter signal spaced only 500 MHz away. The duplicated transmitter subsystem is designed to provide accurate control of power output from 100 W to 20 kW, with control of power shared between the FM and PN paths. Channel combining is performed at SHF to avoid the risk of FM and pseudo­ -noise intermodulation that could arise with a common upconverter stage. The operational requirements of frequency flexibility and high stability are met by deriving the local oscillator signals from frequency synthesizers in the 100­ to 150-MHz band, which are locked to a high stability (1 part in 10 0)master oscil­ lator at 1 MHz. The Type I and Type IUstations have a duplicated master oscillator and one spare synthesizer (as a compromise between full redundancy and economy) for the three operational local oscillator sources (receive, PN, and FM transmit). 15.4.2 Type III and IV Earth Terminals The SKYNET Types I and IV earth terminals"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__492", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 492, "text": "The Type I and Type IUstations have a duplicated master oscillator and one spare synthesizer (as a compromise between full redundancy and economy) for the three operational local oscillator sources (receive, PN, and FM transmit). 15.4.2 Type III and IV Earth Terminals The SKYNET Types I and IV earth terminals have 6-meter (21-foot) diameter antennas. Both types of stations are identical, but the Type IVis helicopter trans­ portable, whereas the Type III is only transportable by standard aircraft. A simpli­ fied block diagram of the signal paths in the Type II and IV earth terminal is shown in Figure 15-7(5)(6). A five-horn static split system is used for tracking, and all the microvave equipment is mounted on the back of the antenna disk. The antenna mount is a simple two-axis elevation/azimuth system. The received signals pass through a diplexer and a band-stop filter to reject transmitted frequencies, and then into a two-stage liquid nitrogen-cooled parametric amplifier. Subsequently, they pass to a mixer/IF preamp combination and then to an IF amplifier where the FDM and spread spectrum signals are separated. The combined uplink IF signal is fed into the transmitter unit where it is converted to the final frequency, and amplified first in an intermediate power amplifier and then in a 15-20 •IN S MODULATORS SS BASEBAND -N XMIT NDRIVE SS DEMODULATORS EQUIPMENT T COMBINER XMIT1 UNIT UNITFM FM MODULATORS DEMODULATORS_7 4FM BASEBAND EQUIPMENT 4 I OUT I 01, PARAMP SERVO MOTORS l RF FILTERS aONVpTER DA'S DOWN RECEIVER Figure 15-6.

Frequency control is the same as in the Type I and II terminals. 15.4.3 Type V Shipborne Terminal Figure 15-8 (9 ) illustrates the essentials for the Type V terminal. Information signals to be transmitted by the terminal are passed through the baseband equipment to the exciter, which produces a low power microwave carrier modulated by the baseband signal. The microwave signal is amplified to a level of a few kilowatts and fed to the waveguide system and the antenna. The waveguide system contains the necessary filter and diplexers for separat­ ing received from transmitted signals. It also contains a monopulse comparator for deriving angular misalignment signals which are fed to,,the tracking receiver. Re­ ceived communications signals are first amplified in a low-noise preamplifier and then demodulated in the receivers after being down-converted to a suitable inter mediate frequency and filtered to select the wanted carriers. The receivers feed the baseband equipment with outputs to the user equipment (telephone; telegraph, etc.). Stabilization of the antenna beam is by reference to the gyro assembly, Which provides an inertial reference pointing angle. Any misalignment of the beam with respect to this reference is sensed by the gyro pickoffs, and corrections are applied by power servo and.drive motors. The inertial reference point angle is updated by signals derived from the tracking receiver so that the beam always points at the satellite. Manual pointing data for initially acquiring the satellite may also be fed to the gyro assembly.

As a result, the. opera­ tional performance has been within the limits that were anticipated. The only space­ craft.malfunction of significance was the failure of one TWT after a year of in-orbit operation. 15.,6.1 System Status There is no SKYNET operational'satellite The, SKYNET-IA satellite launched and orbited in November 1969 ceased operating in November 1972.

The first attempt at launching a SKYNET II satellite, in January 1974, resulted in a mission failure when the second stage of the Delta rocket misfired preventing achievement of a proper orbit. A second launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. A SKYNET III program is planned as a follow-on replacement for SKYNET II. 15-25 CITED REFERENCES (1) F. C.

The tests were conducted 'successfully with positive results. 2. Phase H implementation commenced in.March 1970 to provide an opera­ tional system during 1971-1974. Two satellites were launched success­ fully into synchronous orbit, with one satellite acting as a backup to provide an expected 5-year systerh capability. Table 16-1 summarizes launch.and status information on the NATO SATCOM Phase II satellites. The satel­ lites were procured and launched by the USAF, with technical support from the Aerospace Corporation, under terms of an agreement reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1967 by the U.S. and NATO. Satellite telemetry, tracking and command services are also provided by the USAF Space Ground Link System (SGLS). The satellite technology developed for U. K. SKYNET I satellites was used in NATO SATCOM Phase II satellites. Two minor changes were made to provide a more effective system for NATO. The first modification changed the equal power division between the 20-MHz and 2-MHz channels to a 6:1 ratio, respectively. The second modification shifted the antenna aim­ ing point from the equatorial subsatellite point to a point on earth between 400 and 45 N latitude since all NATO earth terminals were to be located, north of the equator. This yielded a more effective power, 6pread.for NATO coverage over the Northern Hemisphere. 16-1 Table 16-1.

It was configured so that seven large-capacity terminals would operate in the 20-MHz band, each trans­ mitting a single multidestination, 24-voice channel FM carrier, and that five medium­ capacity terminals would operate in the narrowband (2-MHz) channel, each transmitting a single multidestination, 3-channel FM carrier. Each large- and medium-capacity station receives and demodulates a number of carriers dependent on that station's connectivity. Figure 16-1 indicates the interconnectivity of the NATO SATCOM Phase II system. Table 16-3 shows the RF operating frequencies for the 2-MHz and 20-MHz channels. Table 16-4 gives the FM performance characteristics of the demodulators used in the Phase II system. Th e number of modes provided allow the system to change capacity and configuration as long-term requirements vary. 16-5 NORWAY GRMNANTL IL I, OTAL L7 ~f~IJP~CANA1DA Figure '6=1.

Since reliability of communications is of paramount importance, margins are allowed for unpredictable losses:due to weather, power control, misalignments, and equipment degradation. Control of the NATO SATCOM Phase IIsystem is provided in a number of dif­ ferent areas. These are spacecraft control, earth terminal complex (ground) con­ trol, and communications or traffic control.

The system control stations at Belgium and Germany receive and process the same information independently, and are inter­ connected via a land data link so that the system can be controlled from either station by using the equipment provided at the other station. In effect, there is redundancy in the control system. Each control center is provided with computation and display equipment for the analysis and dis­ play of the incoming data. A TTY orderwire network via the satellite has been provided to allow the controller to forward specific control in­ structions to any station. 3.

Figure 16-2 shows the coverage of the WB and NB antennas. The WB antenna will be pointed to 42N latitude and 18°W longitude to concentrate the power in the geographical area of interest to NATO, as in the case of the Phase II satellite. Under this concept, all transmissions from ground stations will-be received by the satellite WB antenna. However, the satellite-downlink transmissions will be routed through the satellite WB antenna repeater or NB antenna repeater depending on the radio frequency transmitted by the ground station. The filters installed in the satellite receiver will be set to accept that frequency assigned to the WB or NB. All terminals in the European area will receive the satellite NB downlink transmissions while those in the Atlantic will receive only the WB downlink trans­ missions. The increased gain of the NB antenna will result in the NB channel having about 3-1/3 times the EIRP of the WB channel. This increased power will meet the larger SATCOM requirements in the European area.

No significant change was observed from the performance measured by Philco-Ford in the laboratory prior to launch. In general, the NATO satellite system is tobe an operational system, not an experimental one. Tests and evaluations are made only to the extent of assuring operational capabilities. Such tests have been successful in showing the feasibility of using satellite communications in support of NATO operations. 16.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS NATO Phase I, a test and evaluation system, is no longer operational.

'The Phase II DSCS remains an integral part of the global DCS, and is designed to provide vital communications service to the United States and Allied Forces throughout the world by-means of satellites. It is composed of space, earth and control subsystb Ms. Table 17-1. Phase II DSCS Objectives Number Objectives' I Establish an operational military satellite communications system which will provide substantial increases in capacity and performance, together with a wider variety of services for users. 2 Satisfy approved requirements for DOD users, both DCS and Tactical, Presidential Communication, Diplomatic Telecom­ munications System, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other specified allies. 3 Provide the following types of service: 1. Protected service for high priority users­ 2. Unprotected trunking and wideband service 3. Contingency service for crisis situations on a global basis. 17-1 The initial Phase II DSCS spacecraft procurement package consisted of six sat­ ellites, which were designed and manufactured by TRW, Inc., under contract to the Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) Air Force Systems Command. The Phase II satellites are spin stabilized and have two steerable narrow beam (NB) (20 X2 ) and one earth coverage (EC) (17 ) antennas on a despun platform. The effec­ tive radiated powers per antenna are 40 dBW (NB) and 28 dBW (EC). The antennas can be cross-strapped to permit any antenna to receive and transmit via any other. The various transponders and cross-straps have different band widths selected on the basis of expected needs. The satellites have tunnel diode inputs and TWT output amplifiers"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__514", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 514, "text": "are 40 dBW (NB) and 28 dBW (EC).

The various transponders and cross-straps have different band widths selected on the basis of expected needs. The satellites have tunnel diode inputs and TWT output amplifiers The first launch of two satellites from the initial procurement of six occurred on November 2, 1971. The Titan 1IIC was used as launching vehicle for lifting the two sat­ ellites into synchronous orbit. Both of the satellites in the initial launch have failed. This left four spacecraft of the original procurement to undergo extensive redesign before a second launch attempt. The redesign included balancing of the design platform and a major change in the power distribution. The redesign was completed and two more Phase H DSCS satellites were launched on December 13, 1973. 1 ) These satel­ lites have undergone extensive testing and were placed into operation in March 1974. Another dual-satellite launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. 17.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Phase II DSCS will have several distinct periods or stages, each providing different communications capabilities. In the first period, Stage la, Phase II operates in the FDMA and code division multiple access (CDMA) modes, and provides a point­ to-point operational capability after completing essential on-orbit satellite tests. In Stage la, the point-to-point terminal linking arrangement results in an oper­ ational system similar to that of Phase I. However, in this case, many links will be handled simultaneously by each satellite. During this initial stage of the Phase II DSCS, only the upgraded Phase I terminals will be included in the system. The traffic will range from one analog voice channel between AN/TSC-54 terminals to 12 analog voice channels between AN/MSC-46 terminals. A few selected links will"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__515", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 515, "text": "simultaneously by each satellite.

The traffic will range from one analog voice channel between AN/TSC-54 terminals to 12 analog voice channels between AN/MSC-46 terminals. A few selected links will provide a wideband 17-2 digital traffice capability to support such requirements as wideband digital data and digitized voice signals. These digital links will be time-shared with FM voice cir­ cuits. The baseband and modulation equipment (i.e., FM modems, multiplex, digital modems, etc.) will be those which are presently in use in the Phase L A typical sys­ tem configuration for Stage ia is shown in Figure 17-1. A protected traffic capability (i. e., circuits resistant to RF jamming) will be provided during Stage la on a terminal-to-terminal basis using existing CDMA (spread spectrum) equipment. These links will be dedicated lines between selected users and will pass vital designated traffic only. Communications control of the system during Stage la will consist of scheduling the coordinated system and the maintenance of discipline by a controller. One controller will be established for each satellite. Three to four satellites may be needed to supply a complete global communica­ tions capability among the geographical locations dictated by military requirements. A limited number of AN/TSC-54 terminals will be equipped to provide a contin­ gency capability in Stage la. These terminals will be self-contained in that they will be provided ith FM modems, multiplex, and ancillary equipment to handle 12 voice channels. The FM modems will be capable of modulating an RF carrier with up to 72 voice channels delivered to the terminal in a baseband form from a-separate tech­ nical control facility. Operation of contingency terminals during this stage will be via the satellite NB antennas."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__516", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 516, "text": "to handle 12 voice channels.

Operation of contingency terminals during this stage will be via the satellite NB antennas. In Stage ib the Phase II system will operate in the FDMA mode to provide a multipoint network satellite communications capability and the code division multiple access (CDMA) mode to provide point-to-point protected (i. e., janf resistant) com­ munications. New FM and PSK modems and FDM multiplexers will be purchased to provide the capacity required to fulfill the Stage lb requirement. The PSK modems will replace MFSK modems for wideband data and secure voice services. A number of earth terminals will provide a multiple carrier transmission/reception capability. These terminals will be deployed to locations (defined as nodal locations) to satisfy specific DSCS requirements. 17-3 120 ISO 180 150 120 9 60 30 0 30 60 30 1 30 r ,- 0 a Fig re ATpiRMINcLt. 12 SoIO 10906 30 0 60 120 ISO M8 ISO 120 90 0 30 0 3 C 6 Figure 17-1.

The four satellite configuration is a typical link plan pending the next scheduled dual launch during the first half of 1975. A two satel­ lite configuration is currently in operation. AN/TSC-54 terminals will be available for contingency operation as described for Stage la. In Stage lb all of the AN/TSC-54 terminals will have been modified for contingency operation through the satellite NB. They will be provided with PN equip­ ment to achieve an antijam capability. Note that operation with the satellite's narrow coverage antennas, in itself, provides jammer rejection when the beam can be placed so as not to include the jammer. Stage Ic will begin when new development in digital equipment (PCM, TDM, PSK and later, coding equipment) is introduced into the system and the analog system is converted to a digital system. FDMA will still be used to the satellite. The intro­ duction of digital operation will result in increased system capacity through a more efficient combination of different types of traffic (voice, TTY, secure voice, data, and wideband data) than is possible in an analog system, and through the use of coding, which allows more efficient use of satellite power.

A block diagram of the communications transponder is found in Figure 17-4. The Phase II satellite transponder consists of a multichannel repeater with the channels cross-linked, a receive and a transmit EC antenna, and two steerable NB antennas, each capable of receiving and transmitting simultaneously. This arrangement will provide four different modes of operation: 1. Earth coverage to earth coverage (EC-EC) 2. Earth coverage to narrow beam (EC-NB) 3. Narrow beam to earth coverage (NB-EC) 4. Narrow beam to narrow beam (NB-NB) The basic interconnection for these four modes is shown in Figure 17-4. 17-7 Table 17-2.

DISCS Phase II Transponder Block Diagram The uplink frequency transmitted by a Phase II earth terminal determines which of the four modes will be used. (This assumes that an earth terminal planning to use either the NB-NB or NB-EC channels is within the geographical area covered by one of the NB antenna patterns.) The received signal is amplified and retransmitted in the 7250- to 7750-MHz band. A simplified frequency diagram presented in Paragraph 17.2.1 relates the various channel nodes, together with their related frequency translations and satellite antennas. Both the EC-EC and NB-EC channels share the output power of a 20-watt TWT amplifier, using the EC antenna. Likewise, the NB-NB and EC-NB channels are combined and transmitted via a second 20-watt TWT, using either one or both of the narrow coverage antennas. The bandwidth of each channel is presented in Paragraph 17.2.1 and represents 410 MHz of usable bandwidth. The satellite EIRP is 28 dBW for the EC mode and 43 dBW for an NB antenna (or 40 dBW each if two are used). This allows a marked increase in capacity and flexibility compared with the 7 dBW of the Phase I satellite. The Phase II synchronous satellites will be maintained with ±3 of their"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__523", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 523, "text": "for the EC mode and 43 dBW for an NB antenna (or 40 dBW each if two are used). This allows a marked increase in capacity and flexibility compared with the 7 dBW of the Phase I satellite. The Phase II synchronous satellites will be maintained with ±3 of their designated orbital positions; however, they can be repositioned at least once during their operational life to any other equatorial point, at a rate of 150per day. Table 17-3 provides a summary of the major characteristics of the Phase II satellite. All active components within the transponder are redundant. The selection of the active components and NB antenna switching and steering is done by ground com­ mand. To achieve maximum in-orbit usage of the Phase II satellite, all onboard sys­ tems have been sized to provide a minimum 5-year operational lifetime. All transmitting antennas are left-hand and circularly polarized, whereas the receiving antennas are right-hand and circularly polarized. The two NB antennas are capable of being independently steered ±100 from each of two orthogonal directions, and the half-power beamwidth covers an area approximately 750 miles in diameter near the subsatellite point. The EC antennas (transmit and receive horns) provide coverage to approximately one-third of the earth's surface. Electrical power is sup­ plied to the satellite from solar arrays. In addition, batteries are provided for eclipse operation. 17-12 17.4 GROUND TERMINALS The two major groups of earth terminals to be employed in the Phase II DSCS include modified Phase I terminals and new terminals to be procured as a follow-on to the current developmental effort.

These modifica­ tions ensure compatibility with Phase H Stage la. Frequency compatibility was achieved by procuring new crystals. Frequency synthesizers will be used for the subsequent stages and for providing the proper frequency increments to change transmit and re­ ceive frequencies in 1-kHz steps over the entire satellite transmit and receive bands. Other modifications will provide a multiple transmit and receive carrier capability. This modification will allow the AN/FSC-9 to handle the following number of signals pending the particular nodal carrier requirements at each location: 1.

The prototype model AN/MSC-60 earth terminal shown in Figure 17-5 is a transportable terminal designed as a seifixed installation, which requires a prepared site and about 45 days to install. Figure 17-6 is a block diagram of an HT/MT prototype terminal. The model has been developed by the Philco-Ford Corporation under a contract to the Army SATCOM Agency. The prototype terminal has completed acceptance testing and is currently operational. The production specification for HT will provide for: * A fixed plant terminal installation that would eliminate the need for vans. * Parallel operation of the two traveling wave tube (TWT) power amplifiers which would allow deletion of the high power klystron amplifier (HPA). * Relaxation of the frequency conversion subsystem specifications to ap­ proximately those requirements applying to the AN/MSC-46 multiple carrier modification equipment. The antenna reflector system consists of a solid-surface, 18-meter (60-foot) diameter, high-efficiency main reflector and a subreflector. The HT terminal G/T and EIRP capabilities are 39 dB/0K and 127 dBm, respectively, and the terminal has a multiple transmit and receive carrier capability. The AN/MSC-60 terminal Interfaces with a communications subsystem at IF frequencies of 70 or 700 MHz for both transmit and receive carriers. Tuning of transmit and receive carriers in increments of 1 kHz over the full 500-MHz uplink and downlink satellite frequency bands is provided.

However, the initial models procured will-be equipped with five transmit and nine receive converters. These terminals are designed to be deployed to nodal locations, replacing selected AN/MSC-46 terminals. The higher inherent availability of these terminals, together with their performance capability, will in­ crease the overall performance of Phase IL 17.4.4.2 AN/MSC-60, Medium Transportable (MT) The AN/MSC-60 (MI) was to be the medium-weight counterpart of the AN/MSC-60 heavy terminal.

Both terminals are basically similar in electronic design and have the same interfaces, redundancy and availability. Hence, Figure 17-6 is also the block diagram for the MT as well as the HT. A primary difference is that the AN/MSC-60 (MT) prototype terminal was equipped with a 5.5-meter (18-foot), aluminium, clover­ leaf antenna that is used with the AN/TSC-54. This increased the transportability of the terminal but decreased the G/T from 39 to 27 dB/ 0 K. It is anticipated that in production of the MT, the 5.5-meter (18-foot) cloverleaf antenna will be replaced by an 11-meter (35-foot) parabolic dish antenna. As shown in Table 17-5 the characteristics of the MT are based on an 11-meter (35-foot) antenna. The prototype specification change discussed for the AI/MSC-60 terminal procurement in Paragraph 17.4.4.1 also applies to AN/MSC-60 (MT) terminal procurement. 17.4.4.3 AN/TSC-86 Light Transportable (LT) This earth terminal has not yet been completely defined; however, the terminal is to be capable of rapid deployment. Table 17-5 presents typical parameters for the LT terminal, which will have one transmit and one receive converter. The terminal is intended for special user service and contingency, but, for the most part, is in­ tended for FD1VIA operation while the DSCS uses FDMA. When TDMA is introduced into the DSCS, either a channelized satellite repeater will have to be used or a special low-cost TDMA modem will have to be developed for the small user. 17-22 17.4.5 Other New Equipment The Phase I AN/TSC-54 terminals were equipped with only ohe voice channel.

Equipping two of these terminals with additional FM modems and an FDM multiplex to provide a limited capability during Stage la began prior to the first satellite launch. These modified terminals will be self-contained in that they will be provided with FM modems, FDM multiplex, and ancillary equipment to handle up to 12 voice channels. Operation of contingency terminals during Stage la will be via the satellite's NB-to-NB satellite communications channel. Protected traffic (i. e., antijam) will be provided during this stage on a terminal­ to-terminal basis using existing AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. This equipment will operate using PN/PSK/CDMA. These links will be dedicated between selected users. The protected traffic on these lines will be commensurate with the capabilities of the present AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 equipment. New FM modems will be provided for all Stage lb nodal terminals and all AN/ TSC-54 terminals. These modems will be capable of providing 3, 6, or 9 4-kHz analog circuits at a lower quality (e.g., TTNR = 33 dB) or 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 DSC quality (e. g., TTNR = 44 dB) 4-kHz analog circuits. Up to three modulators and up to seven demodulators will be installed at nodal terminals to provide service for the number of transmit and receive carriers required. A single modem will be installed in non-nodal terminals. New PSK modulation equipment will be used in Stage lb to support the wideband digital and imagery traffic requirements in a PSK/FDMA mode of operation.

A single modem will be installed in non-nodal terminals. New PSK modulation equipment will be used in Stage lb to support the wideband digital and imagery traffic requirements in a PSK/FDMA mode of operation. This new PSK modulation equipment will allow a more efficient use of the satellite's RF band­ width than do the present MFSK modems. These modems will be capable of operating at a number of data rates from 19.2 kbps to 1.8 Mbps. Stage lb protected traffic will be provided on a terminal-to-terminal basis using existing AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. As in Stage la, dedicated links will be provided between selected users and will pass low data rate hardcore traffic 17-23 only. It will be necessary to locate multiple PN equipment at a node if more than one protected link is to be established between the node and other terminals. The capacity on these links will be commensurate with the capabilities of the present AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 equipment and the satellite power split with the analog traffic. Stage Ic begins with the introduction of the PCM, TDM, and PSK modulation equipment on the first Phase H satellite communication link. No further modifications to the Phase I terminals beyond those made in Stages la and lb are considered nec­ essary to accommodate this new future equipment. Since this new digital equipment will be phased into the Phase II DSCS over an extended period of time, the initial period of Stage ic will be a hybrid operation; i. e. , a mixture of analog and digital operation on separate RF carriers. The extent of this period will depend on the availability of the equipment and the necessary procurement of funds.

The extent of this period will depend on the availability of the equipment and the necessary procurement of funds. To improve the efficiency of the digital transmissions in Stage 1c, error cor­ rection coding equipment will be procured. This coding equipment will allow the transmission of digital data using smaller amounts of satellite power with increased bandwidth, thus allowing larger amounts of digital communications to be processed through the Phase II satellites. Contingency operations will continue to be handled in Stage lc as they were in Stage lb by using the AN/TSC-54 terminals and operating via the satellite's NB-to-NB or cross-strap channels. Unprotected traffic will be transmitted in Stage ic using either analog FM or digital PSK transmissions, depending on the requirements and the availability of the digital equipment. Protected traffic will be provided in the early period of Stage lc at it was in Stage lb by using the AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. However, later in Stage 1c, the new AN/USC-28 PM equipment should be available and will be deployed in all DCS/DSCS earth terminal locations. In addition to increased antijam protection, the AN/USC-28 will provide the operational capability to establish a protected network 17-24 orderwire. This network orderwire will not only provide the capability of a real-time SATCOM control, but will provide a systemwide timing capability imperative to a future TDMA operation. As more digital equipment is procured and deployed in the DSCS, Stage 1c will evolve over a period of time into an all-digital communications system (Stage 2 with TDMA equipment) satisfying all DCS/DSCS traffic requirements using PCM and TDM/PSK. 17.5 EXPERIMENTS The DSCS Phase II is an operational, not an experimental system."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__535", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 535, "text": "digital equipment is procured and deployed in the DSCS, Stage 1c will evolve over a period of time into an all-digital communications system (Stage 2 with TDMA equipment) satisfying all DCS/DSCS traffic requirements using PCM and TDM/PSK. 17.5 EXPERIMENTS The DSCS Phase II is an operational, not an experimental system. Although no experiments have been performed as such, an extensive evaluation program has been successfully conducted verifying the operational capabilities of the system under multi­ link conditions. 17.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS \"The first two DSCS spacecraft were launched in November 1971. Both space­ craft worked well for a limited period; however, one month after launch, a loss of power to the despun platform in the No. 2 spacecraft caused the despun platform to spin up and rotate at the same speed as the body of the spacecraft. Because of the imbalance of the despun platform, the spacecraft in this mode tipped 11 deg from its normal attitude. In this condition it was found that a complicated dynamics problem, not understood at the time of launch, resulted in an ultrastable minimum momentum vector configuration. The normal torque provided by the despun motor was insufficient to bring the spacecraft back to normal operation, i. e., to again despin the platform. Extensive analytical effort and many computer simulations uncovered the problem and finally enabled the re-erection of the spacecraft to an operational configuration. Fol­ lowing this successful operation, other deficiencies appeared in this spacecraft and it subsequently failed. The second spacecraft in this launch provided communications capability for a period ofmonths, but it finally failed due to a power distribution prob­ lem. Four spacecraft remain from this procurement and a major redesign activity was started to ensure that these spacecraft would operate properly.

Four spacecraft remain from this procurement and a major redesign activity was started to ensure that these spacecraft would operate properly. This redesign 17-25 included balancing of the despun platform and a major change in the power distribution. The redesign has been completed and the next two of the DSCS spacecraft were launched on 13 December 1973. ,,(1) The two satellites of the December 1973 launch underwent evaluation during January and February of 1974 and were placed into operation in March 1974.(2) A typical multilink configuration is shown in Figure 17-2. At least three satellites are needed to provide the global coverage dictated by military requirements. A third DSCS Phase 11 dual satellite launch is scheduled for the first half of 1975, which if successful would make such coverage possible. 17-26 CITED REFERENCES 1. V. W.

Its charter ­ called for the establishment of a commercial, domestic satellite system to provide telecommunications services throughout the nearly ' 10 million square kilometers (4 million square miles) of Canada extending across six time zones.

Telesat is owned jointly by the Canadian government, Canadian telecommunications common carriers, and the public. The Telesat communications satellites were manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company and initial earth terminals were manufactured by Canadian companies. The importance of Telesat can be understood when it is realized that hundreds of small towns, hamlets and clusters of isolated communities in northern areas have very limited communications. Some areas have depended on high-frequency radio links for contact with government, business and neighbors in other northern areas and with the larger cities in southern parts of Canada. The Canadian microwave system provides interconnecting links but is concentrated primarily near the United States-Canadian border. Extending this system to the isolated areas would be very costly, and practi­ cally impossible in some parts of the northern regions. The extension of television and communications into the northern two-thirds of the country will pave the way for settlement and resources development. Telesat's major initial customers are the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Trans-Canada Telephone System, and the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways, which operate extensive communica­ tions systems. Telesat, unlike the U. S. Communications Satellite Corporation, is authorized to sell to any bulk customer the equivalent of one television channel or more. The first Telesat satellite was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy by a new Delta launch vehicle on November 9, 1972. This satellite was named ANIK which is the 18-1 Eskimo word for \"brother. \" 4NIK I (Figure 18-1) was placed into synchronous orbit­ 42,596 kilometers (23, 000 nautical miles) above the equator and was positioned at 1140 W longitude. It was first used for commercial service on January 11, 1973, pro­ viding coverage throughout Canada as illustrated in Figure 18-2. A second satellite, ANIK H, was launched on April 26, 1973,"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__541", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 541, "text": "synchronous orbit­ 42,596 kilometers (23, 000 nautical miles) above the equator and was positioned at 1140 W longitude.

A second satellite, ANIK H, was launched on April 26, 1973, and was positioned at 1090 W longitude. ANIK I and ANIK II have the same communications packages. Design features are summarized in Table 18-1. A third satellite has been procured and is intended to be used initially as an earth spare. However, if neither of the in-orbit satellites fails; the third satellite will be launched early in 1975 and will be positioned at 1040 W lon­ gitude to accommodate plans for expansion of the system. The ANIK is capable of providing 12 television channels or various mixes of TV, data, and voice. The initial communication services include three RF channels for TV distribution, two RF channels for telephone message traffic between Vancouver and Toronto, one RF channel for North-South communications using the FDM/FM/FDMA technique, and one RF channel for thin route application using the A-mode/PSK/FDMAU technique. Early in 1974, the eighth transponder was assigned to a two-carrier FM/FDMA system which provides 240 circuits between Allan Park, Ont. (G/T = 37 dB/0 K) and Harrietsfield, N. S. (G/T = 31 dB/°K). This message link carries a portion of the traffic from the CANTAT II Trans-Atlantic Cable System. Subsequently, this FDMA link will be re­ placed by a double-access TDMA system which will increase the capacity to 400 circuits. 18.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system, in its overall configuration, includes spin-stabilized satellites in geostationary orbit; tracking, telemetry and command facilities; a control center and numerous earth stations of several different types.

As a multi-purpose telecommuni­ cations system providing television, radio, voice, data and facsimile transmission services, it was originally designed to meet the initial requirements of Telesat's cus­ tomers and to be interlinked with existing terrestrial systems. However, as further requirements have been raised, changes have been made to some of the earth stations and many additional facilities are being implemented. 18 2 *\"ANIK Launch Handbook,\" Hughes Aircraft Company, October 1972 Figure 18-1.

Each satellite has twelve high capacity microwave channels and each channel is capable of relaying one color tele­ vision program or up to 960 multiplexed voice signals using a single carrier. Multi­ carrier voice modulated signals can also be accommodated within a microwave channel with some reduction in total capacity. Each channel has a bandwidth of 36 MHz and provides not less than 33 dBW EIRP throughout Canada. The communications antenna beam pattern is shaped and aimed to provide optimum coverage of Canada and the cov­ erage area as seen from the satellite at the 1140 W longitude position is shown in Fig­ ure 18-3. The spaceframe consists of a 76-centimeter (30-inch) diameter thin wall cylin­ der coaxial with the satellite, and a 185-centimeter (73-inch) diameter honeycomb sandwich platform. The cylinder surrounds the apogee motor and supports the spin platform, on which is mounted the communications repeater, telemetry and connand electronics, and the batteries. The platform supports the cylindrical solar panel at its periphery and the despin motor by a pedestal-type support at its center. The solar panel substrate is a honeycomb sandwich with fiberglass laminates, on the interior of which are mounted three dynamic balance mechanisms 1200 apart.

This is the baseline system on which the corporation will build and expand as customer requirements and new user contracts for services increase. Table 18-3 includes the names of cities, towns, and settlements near which the terminals are located. A map of the earth terminals is shown in Figure 18-4. Performance characteristics of the Telesat space and earth subsystems are summarized in Table 18-4. The communications system provides for uplink transmission in the 5.925- to 6.425-GHz band and downlink operation in the 3.7- to 4.2-GHz band. TT&C functions required for satellite stationkeeping and positioning are accommodated in the same frequency spectrum. The major contribution of this system to satellite communications technology is that it is the first operational domestic satellite system and, as such, is the forerunner of future domestic systems. Additionally, it will develop and demonstrate earth ter­ minals suitable for unattended operation under severe climatic conditions, including those existing in Arctic regions. 18.3 SPACECRAFT The most significant innovation of the ANIK satellite is the antenna which pro­ duces an elliptical spot beam pattern to cover Canada from its synchronous equatorial orbit (Figure 18-5). The satellite's 152-centimeter (60-inch) antenna is covered with a fine gold mesh, making it optically transparent and, in effect, reducing what otherwise would be a significant disturbance of the satellite by solar pressure.

The feed assem­ bly consists of a three-horn aperture which accommodates both receive and transmit frequencies. The arrangement of the horns in the horizontal dimension assures that the antenna pattern, approximately 30 by 8 0 , is wider in that plane than in the perpendicular one. The shape of the pattern in the wide dimension is determined by the separation between the feed centers. The beam is pointed toward Canada about 7.60 off the equator. 18-7 Table 18-2.

In orbit, ANIK's 4-kilogram (9-pound) antenna remains stationary, pointed toward Canada, as the 2-meter (5-foot) high cylindrical body of the satellite revolves at 100 rpm. Two omnidirectional antennas--a cloverleaf to receive commands and a bicone to send telemetry information--are mounted atop the parabolic reflector. Antenna despin control is achieved by a signal processor comprised of a direc­ tional antenna receive feed assembly acting on a ground-generated pilot signal. Economies in system design have been realized through several steps taken to lessen the satellite's weight and hence its cost in orbit. These steps include satellite attitude determination on the ground rather than by on-board spacecraft hardware, extensive use of thin-walled invar filter waveguides, and affixing the squared solar cells to panels attached to the outer cylindrical body of the spacecraft with rubber cement rather than epoxy. Figure 18-6 shows the Telesat general configuration. The design provides for 10-channel operation during sun eclipse periods when the system must be powered by an on-board battery system. During normal sunlight operation only 10 channels would be in operation, with the remaining two channels used for standby operation. ANIK I has a capacity of more than 5,000 telephone circuits or 12 color TV chan­ nels. Approximately 20,.000 solar cells, each 2 centimeters square, are attached to the cylindrical body of the satellite. The cells provide about 300 watts of dc power. In addition to the solar panel arrays, the satellite is equipped with two nickel cadmium batteries made up of four separate seven-cell packs.

The main body of the satellite is 191 centimeters (75 inches) in diameter and 152 centimeters (60 inches) high and consists of a 76-centimeter (30-inch) diameter thin-walled cylinder housing the spacecraft's solid propellant apogee motor. The cyl­ inder supports the satellite's 185-centimeter (73-inch) electronics platform. The platform contains the spacecraft's communications repeater, telemetry com­ mand electronics, and batteries. At the center of the platform is a pedestal-type support and motor-bearing assembly. The communications antenna is despun at a rate equivalent to the 100 rpm spin rate of the satellite. The communications repeater receives signals sent from ground stations in the 5925- and 6425-MHz band and downconverts these to 3700 to 4200 MHz for retransmis­ sion to other earth stations. The attitude of the spacecraft spin axis is determined on the ground by processing the telemetered sun and earth sensor pulses.' The sun sensors are redundant, spinning, vee-beam sensors which determine the spin phase angle and sun line angle. The earth sensors are spinning infrared telescopes having a bolometer detector and a video am­ plifier.

Two independent orbit and orientation hydrazine reaction control systems are carried aboard the satellite, each consisting of two diametrically opposed titanium tanks, interconnecting gas and liquid lines, and two thrusters mounted just inboard aft of the solar panel. The nozzle of one thruster is oriented to fire nearly parallel with the spin axis and is used for orbital inclination control when fired in a steady state and for spacecraft orientation control when pulse-fired. The nozzle of the second thruster is oriented to fire through the satellite's average center of gravity. It is used only in the pulsed mode for orbital period and eccentricity control. Sufficient hydrazine is stored in the two systems to enable more than 7 years of stationary, zero-inclination stationkeeping. 18-17 The Telesat satellite is intermediate in size between the Intelsat III and Intelsat IV satellites. As in the Intelsat IV, the Telesat repeater is a single conversion with a wideband receiver and a transmitter having 12 separate channels. The 12 transmitter channels are capable of handling 12 television channels (10 eclipse conditions) or vari­ ous mixes of television, data, and voice. The satellite has a design life of 8 years.

Television receive--Remote Television (RTV) 5. Message--Thin Route (TR) In addition, Telesat is implementing a transportable television transmit station and a transportable message station. The capacity of each RF channel on a Telesat satellite is such that it is capable of supporting up to 960 on'e-way voice circuits, or one color television video signal with two 5 KHz audio circuits and one cue and control circuit. When the accessing earth stations have a G/T of 37.5 dB/°K, such as with the Heavy Route stations, the voice circuit noise performance for a 960 channel carrier is 37.5 dBrncO.

When an RF channel is operated in a multiple access mode under the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique, the number of voice circuits per carrier is partially a function of the number of carriers and the G/T of the accessing earth stations. For example, five RF carriers could support a total of 110 two-way voice circuits between one earth station having a G/T of 37.5 dBrncO, and four other earth stations having a G/T of 28 dB. Presently, one of the RF channels is utilized in this manner with three carriers providing message service between Allan Park and Frobisher Bay and Resolute. Another application of this technique provides 240 two­ way circuits between Allan Park and Harrietsfield.

Another RF channel is used in a multiple access mode for Thin Route service, however, in this case, each RF carrier is mod­ ulated by a single voice circuit using phase shift keying with delta modulation and in this type of service, up to 120 one-way circuits can be provided between earth stations with a G/T of about 20 d13. Technical characteristics of the antenna, the receive and transmit assemblies, and the overall performance of these types of earth stations and the control subsystem Tracking Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) stations are summarized in Table 18-7. 18.4. 1 The Allan Park and Lake Cowichan Stations The Allan Park Station, which is the primary station in the entire Telesat network, contains three separate antennas and a large central building to house the necessary support facilities. The communications system, is a multi-purpose communications facility providing television and message services. It also provides a beacon signal and carries all TT&C functions for the satellites. The Lake Cowichan Station has basically the same communications aspects as the Allan Park Station except that its role in TT&C is only that of providing ranging and acting as a backup for other TT&C functions for the satellites. 18-23 Table 18-7.

These stations are engineered to provide high quality transmission and reception of television signals. As these stations are also designed for unattended operations, they are equipped with a supervisory system which permits them to be monitored and controlled from a maintenance center located remotely from the station site. All NTV stations are equipped with a 10.2-meter (33.3-foot) diameter antenna, which in conjunction with a low-noise parametric amplifier provides a minimum G/T of 28 dB/0 K. Basically, these antennas are fixed (with the exception of the Harrietsfield * Station which has recently been outfitted with a step-track system, similar in nature to the systems at Allan Park and Lake Cowichan) and require no tracking facilities; however, they can be steered by remote drive over a limited range in the event that they have to be readjusted to a new satellite orbital position. Accurate satellite station-keeping ensures that the satellite remains near the peak of the antenna beam. The communications equipment at each NTV station, with the exception of the one at Riviere Rouge, includes four TV receivers and a single TV transmit chain, enabling each station to receive four RF channels simultaneously, and to transmit on any one of the RF channels in use for television. Normally, however, three receivers are set up for program reception and the fourth is on standby and is automatically switched in, should any one of the three fail. The Riviere Rouge Station is equipped with two additional TV transmit chains.

The 25 RTV stations provide the means of making available to remote centers the same television program­ ming as is available in the larger population centers. The majority of the stations are provided with a single non-redundant receive chain, however, some are equipped with two receive chains to provide for the simul­ taneous reception of two television channels. 18-32 0 0 AUDIO Wo x SELECTOR LOLAD S Z 0 U I I-STANDBY CHAIN­ (RIVIERE R2UGAE ONLY) TC (TEST COUPLING) z0 UU z-W- CO VIDEO AUDIO 03 CUE CONTROI ~ W m0 -- i--e DE F / Rx No3 Rx NO4 tSAIND LN, M I Figure 18-15.

These stations utilize single voice channel per carrier techniques with delta modulation and biphase PSK (digital) transmission.

The provision of message service is covered by a small facility configured to trdnsmit and receive two voice channels. These two stations are to be operational by mid-1974. The transportable television station has as basic requirements, the ability to be road transported and the ability to provide two simultaneous television transmissions with associated audio.

All eight of the stations supporting network service are currently capable of re­ ceiving three, television channels simultaneously, and although the Allan Park, Riviere Rouge and Lake Cowichan Stations are used to transmit- programs on a full-time basis, all are equipped with a: transmit capability for occasional use. To provide the CBC with the desired flexibility in program origination and recep­ tion for the entire television service, a Cue and Control System embodying remote switching of transmit and receive chains was designed and implemented by Telesat. The system took into consideration the CBC's programming constraints and the fact that the majority of earth stations in support of their services Were equipped as receive stations only and as such, lacked the ability to give status feedback to control centers. It permits the complete control of program distribution by either manual or automatic means from either of the two identical control centers at the CBC premises in Toronto and Montreal.' The circuit carrying the cue and control- commands, which are speci­ fically addressed for each station in the network, is multiplexed into the audio portion of.the television baseband and transmitted along with the video and audio signals.

These two RF channels, each of which can carry 960 one-way message circuits, effectively provide a 960 two-way circuit capability. The circuits can be used for any combination of signals including voice, data and fac­ simile.

Bell Canada, in extending their telephone message facilities in Northern Canada, his ar­ ranged their services as follows: 1. One RF channel is being used to provide high quality telephone trunks to locations requiring six or more circuits. The initial service, from Allan Park to the NTC stations at Frobisher Bay and Resolute, is.referred to as \"Bell Northern Service #1.\" 2. The second RF channel is being used for the \"Bell Northern Service #2\" (Thin Route). This is designed to provide from one to six voice circuits and a radio program capability at smaller northern communities. The first two stations, Igloolik and Pangnirtung, went into service in February 1973; seven additional locations will have service prpvided in 1974,, and a further eight locationa will be operational in 1975. 18-47 Ip oic ]Figure 18-25.

Telesat will provide the link between the western terminal of the cable at Beaver Harbour, which is north of Halifax, Nova Scotia and a COTC switching center in Toronto, using the earth stations at Harrietsfield and Allan Park, respectively (see Figure 18-27). The initial requirement which is for 240 2-way circuits, will be upgraded to 400 circuits in 1975, by the introduction of TDMA techniques. 18. 6,5 DOMSAT Service for U. S. Beginning in July 1974, RCA Globcom/Alascom began using one Telesat trans­ ponder to link earth stations in the Washington-New York corridor, the San Francisco area, and Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska. For more details, see Section 20. 18.7 EXPERIMENTS The Telesat program has included several experimental activities, including a TDMA Study Program. This study was initiated in the summer of 1971. Although re­ sults of theoretical analysis indicated that the TDMA system design could be imple­ mented, there remained two major areas which needed experimental verification--the first being the effect of adjacent channel interference, and the second, the in-band digital performance of the TDMA channel. The first question was associated with the effect of the TDMA signal on its adjacent transponders which may carry a variety of signals. This type of interference is due primarily to energy spreading of the TDMA signal caused by satellite TWT nonlinearities, and post TWT filters. In this case, Telesat was concerned with the"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__572", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 572, "text": "associated with the effect of the TDMA signal on its adjacent transponders which may carry a variety of signals. This type of interference is due primarily to energy spreading of the TDMA signal caused by satellite TWT nonlinearities, and post TWT filters. In this case, Telesat was concerned with the interference level in an analog FM channel since the two neighboring transponders have been assigned to this type of traffic. Experiments were conducted at the Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles in November 1972 to investigate the effects of adjacent channel interference. Results indicated that the ANIK transponder could support a bit rate of 61 Mb/s without causing any noticeable 18-50 ,' \\.-. ',.HARRIETSFIELE) .. Figure 18-27.

A similar experiment was repeated in February 1973 at the Allan Park Earth Station in a more realistic environment (i. e., including the transmit and receive chain, and the satellite in orbit) and results con­ firmed the laboratory measurements. As to the TDMA in-band digital performance, experiments were carried out at Allan Park in March 1973. It was found that the bit error rate performance of the proposed TDMA link at 61 Mb/s was practically achiev­ able A Link Budget for this TDMA system is presented in Table 18-6. This table shows that the link will meet the specified noise performance of 1000 pWpO with an ex­ cess operating margin in the order of 2. 7 dB. The implementation plan will include a three-to-six-month field trial period prior to the actual cutover of the TDMA services. This field trial will provide not only the system operating experience but also an opportunity to verify the results of previous 2) TDMA experiments.("}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__573", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 573, "text": "in the order of 2. 7 dB.

The United States portion of the project will be administered by NASA and will provide the launch vehicle, launch support, environmental test support, and a high power (-200 watts) TWT amplifier. The Canadian effort, directed by the Department of Communications, will be responsible for the design and construction of the spacecraft. Pursuant to this goal, Canada entered into an agreement on May 18, 1972 with the European Space Re­ search Organization (ESRO) which provides for European cooperation in the CTS proj­ ect through the development and supply of two 20 watt traveling wave tubes (TWT), a parametric amplifier, and the solar cell blankets to be used on CTS. The primary objective of the CTS'program is to provide a vehicle for experi­ mentation on the flexibility of satellite communication systems in the 12/14 GHz rekion. The program is expected to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of TV transmission at 12 GHz from satellite to low cost ground terminals, (2) demonstrate the feasibility of TV trans­ mission at 14 GHz from transportable and low cost fixed terminals to the satellite, and (3) develop and flight test components for use in future communications satellites. Ad­ ditionally, the CTS program will include experiments with audio broadcasts, two way telephony, and wideband data links. To meet these objectives the United States and Canada have agreed to initiate experimental programs designed to illustrate the adaptability of satellite systems to the distribution of information to sparsely settled areas.

To meet these objectives the United States and Canada have agreed to initiate experimental programs designed to illustrate the adaptability of satellite systems to the distribution of information to sparsely settled areas. The programs are to be im­ plemented by various independent experimenters who have designed experiments in two categories; those which advance space systems technology and those which demonstrate 19-1 the suitability of space systems to the solution of social problems. The actual experi­ ments planned are discussed in Section 19-4. Current plans postulate that the CTS will be launched into geostationary orbit in January 1976 by a Delta 2914 vehicle. The orbit envisioned for CTS is 1160 W lon­ gitude with a variation in East-West position not to exceed ±0.2 degrees over the two year lifetime. The launch window will be selected to provide an inclination less than one degree for satellite life with the inclination remaining below 0. 65 degree as long as possible. During its operational life the CTS spacecraft will demonstrate several subsys­ tems which constitute advances in the state-of-the-art of satellite communications. The most significant advance expected is the development of a high efficiency, 12 GHz, 200 watt TWT. Successful flight qualification of such a tube will measurably enhance current TWT technology and provide a solid basis for future high power satellite sys­ tems. Two expected spacecraft systems applications advances are the use of an accu­ rate three-axis stabilization on a spacecraft with flexible appendages and the use of an extendable solar array with greater than 1 kilowatt power output. Each of these innovations represents significant application of current technology. The ground segment of the CTS project also represents a significant application of current technology.

Each of these innovations represents significant application of current technology. The ground segment of the CTS project also represents a significant application of current technology. The primary experimental program calls for the use of a low cost TV transmission station equipped with a 3.0-m (10-ft) dish to broadcast from re­ mote areas, and the use of remote TV receivers. The demonstration of the economic feasibility of such services may herald new educational opportunities for those citizens inhabiting the remote areas of both the United States and Canada. 19.2 SPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION Spacecraft characteristics for the CTS are displayed in Table 19-1.

The core of the design is a central thrust tube to which are mounted the apogee motor and the forward and aft equipment platforms. The forward platform is thermally isolated from the rest of the structure to insure a stable surface for the antenna mounts while the aft platform contains the apogee motor nozzle and reaction control system. Surrounding the structural core are the north and south equipment platforms with jettisonable enclosures outside which provide the stow­ age for the extendible solar array. The east and west faces of the spacecraft carry the majority of the body mounted solar cells which provide housekeeping power until station acquisition and the deployment of the solar sails. The east and west faces also contain the spinning attitude sensors. Upon station acquisition the solar sails are deployed. They consist of 30 panels, 26 active and 4 blank, which are extended concertina fashion. Deployment is accom­ plished by means of a single 0. 02-cm (0. 007-in.) thick stainless steel Bi-Stem boom with 3.5 cm (1-3/8 in.) diameter and deployed length of 762 cm (300 in.) located on the shadowed side of each sail. 19.2.2 Thermal Subsystem Throughout the various phases of the CTS mission there will be a wide variation in the amount of heat dissipated by spacecraft components. This necessitates the use of protective devices such as super insulation blankets, jettisonable covers, radiator plates, second surface mirrors, thermal coatings, heat pipes, and heaters to insure the proper operation of spacecraft systems throughout the mission. All major heat dissipating components are mounted on the north-south panels which are covered with silvered quartz second surface"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__583", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 583, "text": "protective devices such as super insulation blankets, jettisonable covers, radiator plates, second surface mirrors, thermal coatings, heat pipes, and heaters to insure the proper operation of spacecraft systems throughout the mission.

CTS Configuration On Station Showing Extendible Array Fully Deployed 19-6 and lower solar absorptivity (< 0. 08). The two most critical thermal problems are maintaining the dimensional stability of the forward deck and providing for the dissi­ pation of heat from the high power TWT. The forward deck must be stable to reduce the pointing error of the antenna system so it is thermally isolated from the rest of the spacecraft structure and insulated from space by multi-layer insulation blankets. The TWT waste heat dissipation problem is to be solved by direct radiation cooling from radiator plates connected to the multi-stage depressed collector (MDC). The MDC assembly extends beyond the aft platform directly exposed to the space environment to enhance the direct radiation cooling. 19.2.3 Antenna Subsystem The SHF communications antenna system consists of two gimballed 71.1 cm parabolic reflectors with 2.50 beamwidth mounted on the front deck and capable of positioning the electrical boresight anywhere within a 14. 50 cone about the normal to ° the deck. The pointing error relative to the deck is less than +0.1 which is suffi­ cient to provide an overall boresight pointing accuracy of ±0.2 0 Each antenna is capable"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__584", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 584, "text": "deck and capable of positioning the electrical boresight anywhere within a 14. 50 cone about the normal to ° the deck. The pointing error relative to the deck is less than +0.1 which is suffi­ cient to provide an overall boresight pointing accuracy of ±0.2 0 Each antenna is capable of simultaneous transmission and reception of ortho­ gonal linearly polarized signals. Isolation between the polarization is at least 25 dB. The antenna pattern generated by each antenna creates sidelobe levels expected to be -14 dB and -25 dB for the first and second sidelobes respectively. The primary TT&C antenna is a circularly polarized helix configuration mounted on the front deck. Boresight gains of 3 dB for telemetry and 2 dB for command are expected. During the station acquisition, and as an alternate during the synchronous phase, the TT&C data will be radiated through a 32 element circularly polarized belt array located at the aft end of the spacecraft thrust tube and providing a toroidal shaped pattern. An SHF beacon antenna mounted on the forward deck is the last component of the antenna package. 19-7 19.2.4 Attitude Control Subsystem The CTS attitude control subsystem consists of two basically distinct systems, one used during the station acquisition phases of the mission and the other during the synchronous operation phase. During the station acquisition phase the spacecraft is spin stabilized about its yaw axis at a rate of 60 rpm and a nutation damper controls disturbance torques. On station attitude control is accomplished through three-axis stabilization which utilizes the \"momentum bias\" principle of storing momentum nor­ mal to the orbit plane to provide gyroscopic stiffness in the orbit plane. Aboard the CTS angular momentum will be stored in a 3,740 rpm, 20 Nms (15 ft-lb-sec) fixed momentum wheel whose spin axis is parallel"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__585", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 585, "text": "through three-axis stabilization which utilizes the \"momentum bias\" principle of storing momentum nor­ mal to the orbit plane to provide gyroscopic stiffness in the orbit plane. Aboard the CTS angular momentum will be stored in a 3,740 rpm, 20 Nms (15 ft-lb-sec) fixed momentum wheel whose spin axis is parallel to the spacecraft pitch axis. Pitch con­ trol is obtained by varying the speed of the wheel. Roll and yaw attitude errors are corrected by operation of off-set hydrazine thrusters which create a component of con­ trol torque in the yaw and roll axes. This results in gyroscopic precession which, within one quarter orbit, removes the yaw and roll errors. 19.2.5 Electrical Power Subsystem Prior to deployment of the extendible solar arrays the; CTS will be powered by two Ni-Cd batteries and body-mounted solar cells. There are approximately 5070, 2 x 2 cm, 8mil thick, silicon solar cells in the body mounted array which are capable of delivering a power output of 77 watts at 29 volts. The main power array consists of 25,272 solar cells mounted on two sails. Each sail consists of 30 panels, 26 active and 4 blank, on flexible Kapton substrate, with a cell packing efficiency of 0. 93. The cells are negative on positive (N/P), 1 to 2 ohm/cn 8 nmil thick, 2 x 2 cm with 4 mil cerium doped cover glass. The cells have an initial efficiency of 10. 5% but the total power output is expected to be reduced by 160 after two years as a result of radiation damage. The main array will provide a total of 1260 watts at beginning of life in two buses. The experiments bus will have 1040 watts at 76 volts while the housekeeping bus will have 220 watts at 28 volts.

The main array will provide a total of 1260 watts at beginning of life in two buses. The experiments bus will have 1040 watts at 76 volts while the housekeeping bus will have 220 watts at 28 volts. Assuming the initial power estimates are achieved, the 19-8 blankets will have a power to mass ratio of 93 watts/kg (42 watts/lb), while the entire subsystem power to mass ratio is 25.1 watts/kg (11.4 watts/lb). To obtain maximum power from the cells while on station each sail will be equipped with a sun tracking mechanism. The sails will rotate one revolution per day 0in increments of 0. 125 The final components of the subsystem are the two Ni-Cd batteries containing twenty-four 5 amp-hour. (AH) cells mounted in aluminum or magnesium blocks for heat sinking. The batteries will have the means to recondition by discharging to a specified level but normally the batteries will be continuously charging. The normal charge rate is C/20, where C is ampere hour capacity at 298.1 0K (25°C), although higher rates to C/10 will be provided. 19.2.6 Communications Subsystem The communications subsystem of the CTS is illustrated in Figure 19-2. The experiment package consists of SHF communications transponder, SHF communications transmitter experiment package (TEP), SHF beacon, and antenna subsystem. The communications transponder portion of the experiment consists of the basic communi­ cations system on the CTS; an input multiplexer, receiver, and two 20 watt traveling wave tube amplifiers. Two significant innovations in this transponder system are the use of Field Effect Transistor (FET) amplifier instead of Transferred Electron Ampli­ fiers (TEA) and the first space use of a low noise parameteric amplifier (noise figure of 3.3 dB).

The tube is being constructed along tech­ niques developed at NASA's Lewis Research Center for multi-stage depressed col­ lectors. The output of the 200 watt TWT is based on a 50% efficiency at 12 GHz. The successful operation of such a tube would significantly advance high power satellite technology. The specifications for the 200 watt TWT are given in Table 19-2 and a typical schematic of this type tube is shown in Figure 19-3. 19-9 P13 &O,$WROtM o t o~ ap 1.-­ \"LC SHF TRANSPONDER RBI/TBI R52/T82 200W 20W CHANNEL '\"\"'\" CHANNEL-PIAYMD Figure2SPR ExFiur 1T2RANSCmmniPONsERimn M Em Table 19-2. 200 Watt TWT Specifications 1.

Typical Traveling Wave Tube 'Elements and Power Processor Electrical Interfaces 19-12 The primary mode of operation for the CTS is to drive the 200 watt TWT with one of the two 20 watt TWTs. Under this scheme the CTS transponder receives a TV trans­ mission at 14 GHz from the Ottawa control station via antenna No. 1 and rebroadcasts through antenna No. 2 via the 200 watt TWT. Simultaneously a signal from a low cost remote transmitter is received via antenna No. 2 and rebroadcast to Ottawa from an­ tenna No. I via the other 20 watt TWT. The alternative mode of operation, and backup in the event the 200 watt TWT is inoperative, is to use the 20 watt TWT in place of the 200 watt TWT. In both modes the transponder has two uplink and two downlink pass bands, each 85 MHz bandwidth, as shown in Figure 19-4. The SHI beacon is the final portion of the SHF communications experiment package and it consists of a solid state transmitter feeding a single horn. The beacon operates at either 12 mW or 20Q mW and broadcasts a single unmodulated carrier at 11.7 GHz. 19.2.7 TT&C Subsystem The TT&C Subsystem utilizes S-band transponders compatible with the Space Tracking and Data Network (STDN) unified S-band system. Command signals will be in PCM/FSK/AM format at a frequency between 2025 and 2120 MHz. The telemetry system is PCM/FM/PM format at a frequency between 2200 and 2300 MHz. 19.3"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__589", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 589, "text": "TT&C Subsystem The TT&C Subsystem utilizes S-band transponders compatible with the Space Tracking and Data Network (STDN) unified S-band system.

The telemetry system is PCM/FM/PM format at a frequency between 2200 and 2300 MHz. 19.3 GROUND STATIONS One of the prime objectives of the CTS program is to demonstrate the feasibility of using low cost ground stations in satellite communication systems. The motive be­ hind this objective is twofold; first, to illustrate that broadcasts to remote areas are economically practical, and secondly, to encourage the participation in the experimental program of independent experimenters with limited financial resources but worthwhile experiments. Since the CTS program envisioned for the United States requires that each individual experimenter acquire the necessary ground equipment for his experi­ ment, the availability of lov cost ground terminals influences the number of potential experimenters. In light of this, the ground stations are configured to use commer­ cially available components.

Each country's tentative program is described in Table 19-4. In general, the-experiments are in two classes; technical and social. The technical experiments are to evaluate the performance of the spacecraft and ground stations while the social experiments are to test the usefulness of a satellite communications network in solving social problems. 19-15 / Terminal Control (Ottawa) CD TV remoteQ transmission TV receive only and two-way voice Two-way voice and/or FM sound broadcast receive Diam 9.1 m (30 ft) 3.0 m (10 ft) 2 m (8 ft) 1 M (3 ft) Table 19-3.

The information on these Domsat systems is based mainly on applications before the Federal Communications Commissi6n (FCC) and may become out of date as the sys­ tems become operational. -The data on earth terminals especially may change as the systems progress. The FCC applications are listed as References 1 through 6. 20-1 20.2 AMERICAN SATELLITE CORPORATION (ASC) 20.2.1 Program Description ASC's program is planned to evolve in three phases. The first phase involves the leasing of up to three satellite channels from Telesat Canada or Western U'nion and the construction of four earth terminals. The second phase includes the procurement and launch of at least two Hughes-built 12-channel satellites and the addition of eight earth terminals. The third phase includes plans to utilize 24-channel satellites. Phase I can be of considerable duration. 20.2.2 System Description ASC leases radio frequency (RF) transponder channels on the Western Union Westar satellite. The earth segment is provided by ASC. Earth terminal locations near New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas are planned or exist. Additional terminals are to be placed to serve certain military bases such as Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska. 20.2.3 Spacecraft The Westar satellite, used in the ASC Domsat system, is described in Section 20.5.3. 20.2.4 Ground Terminals An ASC ground terminal includes a 10. 1-meter (33-1/3-foot) diameter antenna"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__599", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 599, "text": "Additional terminals are to be placed to serve certain military bases such as Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska. 20.2.3 Spacecraft The Westar satellite, used in the ASC Domsat system, is described in Section 20.5.3. 20.2.4 Ground Terminals An ASC ground terminal includes a 10. 1-meter (33-1/3-foot) diameter antenna and associated electronic communication equipment. Each ground terminal has the capability of receiving and transmitting multidestination FDM radio carriers which establish connec­ tions with the other stations. In Phase I plans, there are four terminals so that each will transmit one FDM carrier and receive three FDM carriers. In Phase H of ASC plans, the capability of interconnecting with two satellites simultaneously will be added. The ASC system is also to include receive-only terminals which will be capable of being located in regions congested with interfering signals so that operation will be possible over only a portion of the allocated band.

The earth terminals will be owned by AT&T, while the satellites will be owned and operated by the Comsat General Corporation. AT&T will lease satellite channels from Comsat General. On February 28, 1973, an agreement for provision of domestic communications sat­ ellites was signed between AT&T and the Communications Satellite Corporation (now Comsat General Corporation). The FCC subsequently authorized the construction of the satellite system proposed by AT&T whereby the satellite system would be integrated into the existing AT&T system, except for private line service. Comsat then placed an order with Hughes Aircraft Company to design and build the modified Intelsat IV satellites to be used in the AT&T satellite system. The first of these satellites, Comstar I, should be ready for launch in early 1976. The General Telephone and Electronics Company, now GTE Satellite Corporation (GSAT), initially filed an application in December, 1970, for a separate Domsat system 0 with Hughes Aircraft Company as a partner. On April 18, 1974, AT&T, GTE, and GSAT requested authorization from the FCC to combine the two separate systems into one joint Domsat system whereby four AT&T earth terminals and three GSAT earth terminals would use the Comsat General satellites to provide domestic communications satellite service. As of the publication date, the FCC has not reached a decision concerning the joint Domsat system (FCC Docket No. 20201). 20.3.2 System Description The system will initially involve three satellites and seven earth terminals.

The overlap is possible since a horizontally gridded reflector is transparent to vertical po­ larization. The Satcom support subsystem characteristics in Table 20-5 and the weight and power summary of Table 20-6 provide more detail on the satellite. The Satcom satellite communications subsystem is described in more detail by the antenna beam coverage diagram in Figure 20-12, the block diagram of Figure 20-15, and the beam assignments in Table 20-7. 20.4.4 The RCA Ground Terminals The earth segment of the RCA Domsat system is operational in part and is being used in conjunction with leased channels first on the Canadian Telesat (Anik) satellites and presently on the Western Union Westar satellites. There are several kinds of ter­ ninals in the earth segment. These terminals and their characteristics are listed in Table 20-8 facilitating comparision between the CONUS, Alaska, and bush terminals which were planned; and the large Talkeetna terminal which was purchased from Comsat; and the transportable terminals which were already available. A notable feature of certain earth terminal electronics is the single (voice) channel per carrier (SCPC) equipment which results in great operational flexibility for small users.

The earth terminal electronics is described for the various terminals in Figure 20-16 which is a block diagram of an 11-m (35-ft.) dual feed antenna terminal, and Figure 2-17 which is for a 10-in (35-ft.) single feed antenna terminal; and Figure 20-18 which shows the relative simplicity of a receive only earth terminal. 20-22 CDt Figure 20-13.

RCA Receive Only Terminal Functional Block Diagram 20-34 20.4.5 Operational Results The RCA Domestic Satellite System has been in operationsince late December 1973, using RCA earth terminals and leased satellite channels first on the Canadian Telesat (Anik) satellites and presently on the Western Union Westar satellites. Communications services for voice and data traffic within and between Alaska and the 48 contiguous states are provided by RCA Alascom and RCA Globcom. NOTE: The RCA communications satellite, Satcom I, was launched December 12, 1975. Transponder testing is scheduled to begin in January 1976, and com­ mercial traffic is scheduled to begin in late February. 20-35 20.5 WESTERN, UNION 20. 5.1 Program Description The Western Union domestic satellite system program was aimed at providing an early entry into the U.S. marketplace. Satellites almost identical to the Anik were or­ dered from Hughes. The five earth terminals were ordered from ITT Space Communica­ tions. Operations began in July 1974 after launch and initial checkout of Westar I. 20.5.2 System Description The Westar system augments Western Union's extensive microwave relay system which runs across the United States from east to west and also into Texas.

Operations began in July 1974 after launch and initial checkout of Westar I. 20.5.2 System Description The Westar system augments Western Union's extensive microwave relay system which runs across the United States from east to west and also into Texas. The micro­ wave relay system is shown in Figure 20-19. Also shown are the Westar earth station locations. The initial Westar system includes two geostationary satellites in orbit, each with 12 RF channels of 36 MHz bandwidth, and five major earth stations. Each satellite RI channel has a capacity of 1 video channel or 1200 voice channels or 50-60 Mbps digital data in the single-carrier-per-transponder mode. The 12 channel frequency plan is diagrammed in Figure 20-20. 20.5.3 The Space Segment--The Westar Satellite Westar I is on-orbit at 99OW longitude. Westar II was launched in October 1974 and was stationed at 91 0 W longitude. It is presently operating at 123.5 0 W longitude, providing service for RCA. These satellites are almost identical to the Canadian Telesat Anik Satellites. The most significant improvement is an onboard backup despin system which prevents spin-up on loss of pilot. While the early Aniks were designed for launch by a Delta 1914 vehicle, Westars were designed for launch by a Delta 2914 vehicle. A diagram of the satellite is presented in Figure 20-21, and a weight breakdown is given in Table 20-10. A summary of the Westar general characteristics as well as its communications and TT&C subsystems is presented in Table 20-11. A noteworthy innovation is the ground processing and retransmission of sensor-data to attain proper synchronization for the despun antenna. 20-36 THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH EXISTING AND PENDING TERRESTRIAL AND WESTAR MICROWAVE SYSTEMS MAP zOOMPANY EARTH STATION 4c,, m&' \" z0-i9 .10y I1zS'.e Azo ,"}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__618", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 618, "text": "subsystems is presented in Table 20-11.

These components operate in conjunction with a rotary joint. A block diagram of the Westar communications transponder is shown in Fig­ ure 20-23. 20.5.4 The Western Union Earth Segment The Western Union earth stations are at Glenwood (also containing the satellite control center), Estill Fork, Lake Geneva, Steele Valley, and Cedar Hill. A diagram of the 51-foot cassegraine antenna used is given in Figure 20-24. Four of the five earth stations have been designed to operate unattended. The fifth, at Glenwood, serving New York City, is continuously manned, and monitors and controls the others by means of a fault monitoring and control (F/C subsystem), thus assuring economical and reliable operation. The Glenwood terminal can also be characterized by its three antennas which it needs to fulfill its dual role of communications terminal and operations control center. Two of these antennas, 15.5 m (51 ft.) diameter each, are for communications pur­ poses and for ranging and telemetry of in-service satellites. A pictorial diagram of a 15.5 m (51 ft.) diameter antenna is shown in Figure 20-24. The third, known as the Tracking, Telemetry, and Control (TT&C) Antenna, was used for ,the Westar I and II launches, and will be used for future launches. It also functions as a backup TT&C and test antenna for in-service satellites. The other terminals contain two antennas, one for each Westar satellite. The major characteristics of the communications and TT&C earth terminals are summa­ rized inTable 20-12."}, {"id": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs__621", "source": "nasa-compendium-of-satellite-communications-programs.pdf", "chunk_index": 621, "text": "I and II launches, and will be used for future launches.

In April 1974, Westar I was successfully launched, and commercial service was in­ augurated in July 1974.

Generally, there is a threshold below the performance of the communication system is unacceptable. In digital communication systems, the bit error rate of the system often becomes unacceptably high (according to the promised performance by a communication system) below a certain SNR. We have employed link budgets to predict the received power in a communication system. A natural evolution to a link budget to adapt it to determine the received SNR. In this course we have focused on narrowband radio systems where a sinusoidal signal is assumed. In practise, the sinusoid acts as a carrier for the information signal, which is the true \\signal\". Hence, strictly speaking, the SNR refers to this power of the recovered signal power to noise power. We will use the term carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) to refer to the received carrier power.

INTRODUCTION NREN requirements for development of seamless nomadic networks necessitates that NREN staff have a working knowledge of basic satellite technology. This paper applications, technology trends, orbits, and spectrum, and hopefully will afford the reader an end-to-end picture of this important technology. Satellites are objects in orbits about the Earth. An orbit is a trajectory able to maintain gravitational equilibrium to circle the Earth without power assist. Physical laws that were comeptualized by Newton and Kepler govern orbital mechanics. The first satellite was the Moon, of course, but the idea of communications satellites came from Sir Arthur C. Clark in 1945. The Soviets launched the first manmade satellite, Sputnik I, in 1957. The first communications satellite (a simple reflector) was the US. Echo I in 1960. The first “geosynchronous” (explained later) satellite, Syncom, went up in 1962. There are now over 5000 operational satellites in orbit, 232 of which are large commercial (mostly communications) satellites. Satellites have become essential for modern life. Among the important applications of satellite technology are video, voice, IP data, radio, Earth and space observation, global resource monitoring, military, positioning (GPS), micro-gravity science and many others. From direct-to-home TV to the Hubble telescope, satellites are one of the defining technologies of the modem age. Video is the most successful commercial application for satellites, and direct-to-home distribution is the most promising application for the technology at this time. “Spot” images of places on Earth, GPS, and Internet access-both for providers and direct-to-home or oficehave been most successful, while cell phone systems based on fleets of low flying satellites have been a flop.

Mobile phone-like connections for marine and mobile services have been with us for some time, however. Satellite services have some big advantages, such as being available almost everywhere on Earth without wires, being mobile, being the perfect broadcast medium, and being protocol agnostic. The downside to satellite technology is that satellites have either a limited visibility over a spot on Earth, or a long round-trip time, and they broadcast data that can be received by anyone under them. Satellite transmissions are also affected by both terrestrial and space weather. They are subject to a higher error rate than fiber, and they are complex from both a physical and regulatory point of view. Satellites are launched from Earth by the shuttle, from high-flying airplanes, or from ground-based rockets. Once launched, payloads must reach proper elevation and escape velocity to be boosted into orbit.

Satellites in these orbits can communicate with the Earth by “pass of€” to a fleet of like satellites providing full Earth coverage. They can also pass off to a geosynchronous relay satellite, or they can dump data to the ground as they pass over a ground station. Most of these “near Earth” satellites are in orbits that go over or near the poles; some go over the same place on Earth at least several times a day. The coordination and placement of Earth stations to “operate” and take data from these satellites is a major consideration in the life cycle of a satellite.

This was developed and used extensively in Russia. Geosynchronous orbits are the most desirable and the most expensive to obtain. “Geosynch” satellites appear stationary to observers on the Earth. The orbit is always at the equator at a height of 23,400 miles; the satellite thus travels in the same direction and I Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN speed as the rotation of the Earth. These satellites, because they provide continuous coverage, are the workhorses of the commercial satellite industry. Geosynch satellites must be spaced at least 1/2 a degree apart to prevent signal interference. “Slots” are closely regulated by the International Telecommunications Union (T.C.U.). They are highly sought after and expensive to acquire, and since geosynch orbits are also expensive to launch and maintain, most satellites in this orbit are big and complex. Geosynchronous orbits require at least a quarter second round-trip time because of the 23,400-mile distance above the Earth plus the distance to the equator from the ground station. More power is also needed because of the distance (although a larger antenna on some satellites mitigates some of this). Since geosynch satellites are always in approximately the same place with regard to the Earth, it is possible to precisely map a “footprint” so that users can calibrate ground station equipment to minimize power and bandwidth. Geosynch satellites are kept tightly in their orbits by expending fuel. Older satellites are often let to drift north and south while keeping in their east-west slots.

This is because a satellite is less capable of dealing with the overtones derived from transmission. The higher the fi-equency the more bandwidth it takes to send a bit. That is because there that are absorbed by water and free Oxygen. Also, the higher the frequency the smaller is the antenna needed for the same bandwidth, as antenna size is related to the size of the waveforms. The exception to this is L-Band where the signal is omni-directional. K- Band is not used for satellite transmission as these frequencies are absorbed completely by water vapor. Traditional C-Band, the first spectrum opened to satellites for communications, requires a BUD (big ugly dish) at least 3 meters in diameter for even a small bandwidth V-Sat, and up to 20 meters for a proper Earth station. Ku and Ka use small dishes that can be portable. 4. EARTH STATIONS Teleports, gateways, and “flyaways” are names for the terrestrial interface where the signal from satellites meets the ground and where data is uplinked to the satellite. The traditional architecture for satellite systems is to have a central complex with an antenna or antennas controlling transmission to and &om satellites. Smaller antennas communicate to other ground stations or terrestrial networks via. the central teleport. Teleports act as a gateway between terrestrial networks such as the PSTN, the Internet or cable TV infrastructure, 2nd the srtellite. is gicztei atterriattioii of the sipa! “vj: the amospheie ii~ i;v‘e get c!osei to &e frequei~ci~~ 4 Introduction to Satellite"}, {"id": "introduction-to-satellite-communications-technology-for-nres__6", "source": "introduction-to-satellite-communications-technology-for-nres.pdf", "chunk_index": 6, "text": "ground stations or terrestrial networks via. the central teleport.

A reflector and feed: This is the ''dish\" that is the most visible component of the system. The dish focuses the signal on the feed which sends it on. The size and shape of the dish are a function of the frequencies used and the strength of the signal. The larger the dish, the smaller the area of the sky it can see. This seems counter-intuitive but it is true. 2. Outdoor equipment: This equipment isolates the signals to those we are interested in and amplifies the signals (both send and receive). The equipment to change the ffequency range to those the satellite expects (up and down converters) from L-Band can be either indoor or outdoor. 3. Cable: Cable connects the antenna to the inside equipment. 4. A satellite modem that operates in L-Band (this could be separate modulators and demodulators): These modems do more than the common terrestrial versions in doing 1 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN A/D and D/A conversion.

They also define the signal method, do error correction using redundancy coding, do time and frequency multiplexing, and perform link monitoring. Satellite links are often asymmetric, having the ability to receive more dzta than they can send. 5. Tracking gears: Gears move the antenna, if needed. 6. A mtc~owove ~cnsporcnt bt;i!dirzg (radome): A radome is required if the reflectm, feed and outdoor equipment requires covering from wind and snow. 7. The terrestrial interconnect: This could be a router, or a video codex or a multiplexer to combine several input streams. In order for an Earth station to become operational it must go through a series of tests and adjustments. The tests are designed to test whether proper frequencies and time slots (for TDM access) are used. Measurements are made and documented to insure that the power levels are correct. The power is measured in terms of Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRE’). The units are decibels (dBW). Too much power can cause the signal to be distorted and could disrupt other communications. Under-powered transmission can be error prone. The noise level in both directions is measured. This is G/T (the ratio of the gain fi-om the antenna and outdoor equipment to the signal noise). The higher the ratio the better. The definitive test is of course the actual error statistics measured by sending test data in both db3CtiOES. 5.

COMMUNICATIONS ONBOARD A SATELLITE Earth orbiting satellites are a wonder of modern technology. Everything must withstand the rigors of space in addition to the strain of the launch. In space there are extreme cold and heat, radiation and micrometeorites, and storms on the Sun. Orbits must be obtained and maintained and critical systems must be monitored. There are as many “floor plans” to satellites as there are applications for the technology. 6 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN The main systems on a satellite are power, propulsion, guidance, sometimes science instruments, and of course communications and tracking. The minimum communications capability for any satellite, no matter its purpose, is a low-speed link capable of send and receive for commanding, tracking and telemetry. 6. COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES Communications satellites divide bandwidth between “transponders.” A transponder is the hardware needed to take signals in on one set of frequencies and re-send to the ground on other frequencies (like a bent Dipe). Usually a transponder is caDable of sending I and receiving about 45 Mb/sec. These are analog signal processors, so-the modulation technique will determine the bandwidth a user can actually expect. 1. C-band transponders are usually 36 MHz wide 2. Ku-band transponders are usually 54 MHz wide 3. Ka-band transponders are usually 100 MHz wide The total capacity of a “Comsat” is between 1/2 and 2 Gb/sec, much less than a pair of fiber strands. Frequency reuse is obtained by use of beams. They separate the direction of the transmissions and reception by pointing the antenna at the ground in different directions. Thus a satellite can send the same frequencies on a beam to Chicago and also on a beam to New York Additional bandwidth is obtained by use of polarization that doubles usable bandwidth.

Thus a satellite can send the same frequencies on a beam to Chicago and also on a beam to New York Additional bandwidth is obtained by use of polarization that doubles usable bandwidth. Solar weather can very adversely affect communications satellites, sometimes to the extent that a flare will actually render a communications satellite inoperable. Geosynchronous communications satellites have a predictable power signature for areas covered by their transponders. This footprint makes it possible to know the required dish size and power requirements before an Earth station is assembled at a site. Errors can be minimized and higher bandwidth obtained by using a bigger dish, more power, or better coding. 7. DWCTIONS IN THE SATELLITE INDUSTRY The great down-turn that has hit the technology and communications industry in general has not spared the satellite industry. Some nations, such as Japan, have drastically cut back their space research and development. Even the International Space Station may never reach its low goals. Both commercial and government (except military) launch schedules have been cut back making it unlikely that all of the players who build and launch satellites will last the next few years. Even amid this “consolidation, competition, retrenchment and turbulence” there are positive trends that will survive this turndown and thrive in the early 21’‘ century. Some of the trends include the following: 1. Spurred by the military, there will be more big “birds” with more bandwidth and new spectrum. 7 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.

The new paradigm is universal, bi-directional access, including television, Internet and new media over the next-generation satellite systems. There will be more IP in space. Multicast will become accepted after adoption on satellite-based ISP backbcjiies. IP services will be integrated with TV broadcast, first using DVB-S (digital video broadcasting-satellite) technology and then straight IP. Novel applications __ (like the roll out of satellite car radio) will be developed. Earth science applications will require more spectrum and direct access for users internationally. “On demand” will be the next wave. As global warming and other environmental issues come to the forefront, Earth Observing satellites will become more prominent. Satellites have been with us nearly half a century and have evolved considerably. The next 50 years will bring more technological changes that will affect our lifestyles. 8"}, {"id": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards__0", "source": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards.pdf", "chunk_index": 0, "text": "PB89-I13526 SuitabilityofANSIStandards for Quantifying Communication I Satellite System Performance (U.S.) National Telecommunications and Information Administration, Boulder,CO Preparedfor NationalAeronautics andSpace Administration Cleveland,O_ Aug 88 Ul&I)m,,_,mt'_f_(_mmoe Nmmt;_,lmm,t_.

INTRODUCTION Ithasbeen argued that communication satellites arelosing their monopoly inthe long-haul transmission market (Byrne, 1985). With the day-by-day increase inoptical fiber cable miles and long-haul communication providers such asSprint touting the advantages ofoptical fiber communicatio_s, the communication satellite industry future does indeed seem dim. }{owever, one must remember that the imminent demise ofterrestrial m_crowave systems _a_ incorrectly predicted with theadvent ofcommunication satellites. Today, both communication satellites and terrestrial microwave systems coexist inahighly competitive market. Although, theimmediate competitive threat imposed byfiber istotheterrestrial microwave systems, this does not imply tha\" thecommunication satellite industry andservice-providers need do nothing toenhance their product° Toremain aviable andprofitable industry, communication satellites will need toevolve beyond therole ofsimple, loug- haul transmission links. They will need tobecome anintegral part ofdata communication networks such asanIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). *The author iswith the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, National Telecommunications andInformation Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce, Boulder, CO80303-3328. ! _a • r_:._._r_!_,_ ,_,_.__..,..___. _........... _............,,_.,,_,_._._._ ,._,.._._,.._..,_ _..::,_:._........._..___•_._ _,_o._,_,_ _,_ _,__.;__..__._,•__,_.,_.._,_ __._. ..... _ i\" Commensurate with this evolution, theways bywhich communication satell_te sv':tem performance ismeasured andspecified needs tobereevaluated. 1.1 Evolution oftheCommunication Satellite andItsRole Lovell andCuccia (1984) ofNASA have classified communication satellites into thre_ categories: i.Type Asatellites carrying one ormore simple transponders and earth-coverage antenna. 2.Type Bsatellites carrying multiple fixed antennas and multiple transponders, where under ground control the in_erconnectivity ; between thebeams andtransponders canberearranged. ! 3.Type Csatellites similar totype Bbutwith onboard message- i; J switching capabilities. _i The transponders forboth type Aandtype Bsatellites areanalog a'._dsupport i single ormultiple communication channels.

Insome designs, (NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite [ACTS] forexample) thetransponders aredigital andregenerate the signal. The first commercially viable communication satellites were simple analog micrm:ave repeaters ingeostationary orbit. Their main function wastoprovide point-to-point, high volume trunking for telephone and television systems. • Even with today's increased transponder capacity anddown-link power, higher operating frequencies, time-divisio,_ multiple-access (TDMA), digital modulation, and frequency reuse, communication satellites are still notmuch mo,. than repeaters, Unfortunately, these high volume, point-to-p_int satellite tru:,Li.g services are chose most threatened byoptical fiber systems,Traditionally for geographic separations greater then 800 km, point-to-point satellite trunking has been the most economical trm_smission method (Byrne, 1985). i However, with the introduction ofoptical fiber transmission li_ks this distance advantage isdecreasing. The,s0 future communication satellite systems i will have tolook elsewhere fortheir marketshare. i Fortunately, the demand forpoit_t-to-multipoint service isincreasing. ,, Th_s demand has been fueled byhigher frequency andhigher power satellites i1989010985-012 such asthose planned forDirect Broadcast Service (DBS) andadvances inearth station technology reducing the costs ofsmall receive-only earth stations. For $i000 to$2000, almost any broadcast service can bereceived inthe remotest parts ofthe country. Multipoint-to-point, e.g.,oil pipeline monitoring systems (Gonze, 1987), isanother service that communication satellites arebeginning toprovide.

TheNASA ACTS program takes thesatellite be,_ond this simple repeater role byproviding anexperimental advanced communication satellite that will demonstrate improved repeater technology andonboard baseband switching for traffic routing andnetwork control. Thesatellite will operate intheKaband (17to31GHz) with small diameter spot beams andcross polarization _oreduce interchannel interference andtoiucrease frequency reuse. Theonboard switch will operate ineither amicrowave mode, switching atthe intermediate frequency (IF) like type Csatellites (INTELSAT VI), orinabaseband mode, operating asademand-assignment multiple-access (DAMA) _y_cem with digital signal regeneration and forward error control coding. Thus, therole ofthe communication satellite isevolving from one ofasimple point-to-point transmission link tothat ofanetwork switching center, further enhancing the communication satellite's ability to provide point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point network connectivity. Satellites, such asACTS, and inexpensive very-small-aperture terminals (VSAT) will enable communication satellites toprovide economical, thin-route, two-way communication services tosparsely populated andinaccessible areas. These satellite systems will also facilitate two-way mobile communication. Additionally, thesp satellites will fitvery naturally into data networks such asanISDN, where thesatellite itself becomes oneoftheISDN switching nodes. Satellites with onboard ISDN switching capability could beUsed toprovide private ISDN services for large corporations. They could interconnect geographically dispersed locations with high-volume 23B+D Primary Rate ISDN (1.544 Mb/n) ormultiple-megabit per second broadband ISDN circuits.

When satellites provide simple analog repeater service, the users are primarily concerned with thesystem capacity, measured asthenumber ofanalog voice circuits orvideo channels thesystem cansupport. This isafunction of themodulation techniques andthecarrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) ofthe i total satellite link (wh_re C/No isestablished bythe basic link budget calculations). Very often theusers arenotexperienced orinterested inthe details ofsatellite link budget calculations; however, they are very interested inhow well the system meets their capacity and availability requirements. Thus, users generally buy service frol0satellite service providers who design the users'links. Once established, the links are dedicated full time totheusers. The situation for digital satellite transmission links isnot much i different from that foranalog. Capacity isstill theyardstick formeasuring I performance and itstill depends onlink budget calculations. (Th_ signaling rate-dependent, bitenergy-to-noise density ratio [Eb/No] isused inplace of C/No astheprimary link budget parameter.) However, capacity isnowmeasured astheuser-information bitrate with aspecified biterror probability (Pc).

Again theusers typically gotosatellite service providers toobtain thelinks they need.Also,asintheanalog case, once thelinks areestablished, they arededicated full time totheusers. With communication satellites incorporating more ofthenetwork switching functions and thus more users accessing thenetwork onademand assignment multiple access (DAMA) basis,link budget calculations nolonger fully specify system performance. Users are becoming concerned with parameters such as access anddisengagement time andblocking probability. Thetransmission link isalso more dynamic inthese type Csatellites, with forward error-control coding andreduced transmission rates \"switched in\"during rain fades. Quantifying theperformance ofthese advanced type Csatellites canbecome anarduous task. However, ifoneviews these satellite systems asthedigital communication networks they arebecoming, thetask isquite manageable. This isbecause oftwo standards approved bythe American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American National Standards (ANS) X3.]02 andANSX3.141, for specifying and measuring data communication system performance with user- oriented performance parameters. These standards define parameters and measurement methods forquantifying data communication system performance from theuser's point ofview, independent ofsystem design and implementation. ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 provide thedata communication system user a\"common yardstick\" forcomparing howwe_l dissimilar systems--satellite, optical fiber, microwave, orany other transmission media and switching systems--meet their needs. ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 canbeused tohelp identify what each system does best. And theuser does notneed toknow how thesystem isdesigned or implemented. From theservice provider°s point ofview, ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 offer aconvenient means forcomparing their service against acompetitor's. These standards can also beused totrack system degradations n'_d help identify potential bottlenecks. They areused toaugment thelink budget andcapacity calculations forfully describing thesystem performance. 1.3 Purpose andScope ofReport This report focuses on communication satellite system performance measurements and specifications.

Tohelp solve this problem, ANSI approved thetwodata communication systems performamce standards: I.The American National Standard for Information Systems--Data Communication Systems and Services--User-oriented Performance i Parameters, ANSX3.102 (ANSI 1983). i 2.The American National Standard for Information System_--Data Communication Systems andServices--Measurement Methods forUser- oriented Performance Evaluation, ANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987). These two standards form the basis ofth_ \"functional approach\" todata communication system procurement described inSeitz andGrubb (1983). Thebenefits ofusing this functional approach andofthese ANSI standards are many. Tothe data communication system users, their requirements are precisely defined; they donotneed tobecome system designers and they can specify the system that best fits their needs and budgets without being constrained toaparticular design.

Andtothedata communication experimenters andresearchers, they nowhave themethods and tools forconducting and analyzing repeatable data communication system performance measurements onexperimental systems such as ACTS. 2.1 ANSX3I02Approach End-to-end system performance isdescribed bythe performance ofthree system functions: access, user information transfer, anddisengagement. These system functions are quantified bythree performance outcomes: successful performance (speed), incorrect performance (accuracy), and nonperformance (reliability). Seitz andGrubb (1983) define these performance outcomes as follows: i.Successful Performance. The function iscompleted within a specified maximum performance time, and theresult oroutput is exactly what was inte_4ed. Afamiliar example issuccessful connection tothecorrect called party inavoice telephone call. 2.Incorrect Performance. The function iscompleted within the specified maximum performance time, but the result oroutput is somehow different from what was intended. Afamiliar example is the connection toa\"wrong number\" (as aresult ofasystem switching error) inavoice telephone call. 3.Nonperformance. Thefunction isnotcompleted within aspecified maximum performance time. Afamiliar example istheblocking ofa voice telephone call attempt bythesystem (asindicated bya\"all trunks busy\" signal). Asummary ofthe performance outcomes that apply tothevarious system functions isshown inTable i.Incor[ect performance issubdivided into three outcomes: content error, where the information isinerror; location error, where the information was sent tothewrong location; andextra event, where unrequested information was received. Nonperformance issubdivided into two outcomes: system nonperformance, where the system isresponsible for the outage; anduser nonperformance, where theuser isresponsible fortheoutage. Nonperformance outcomes duetouser nonperformance areexcluded from thesample space andsystem performance calculation asthese donotmeasure anyfunctions performed bythesystem.Thebit transfer andblock transfer functions shown inTable iaresubsets oftheuser information transfer function.

Themajor effort inapplying ANSX3.102 toend-to-end data communic_it;o_ system performance measurements isselecting the appropriate performaTwe 71989010985-017 1989010985-018 parameters. Sections 3and4ofthis report address this forseveral classes ofcommunication satellites. Table 2lists, inmatrix _orm, the21ANSX3.102 performance parameters defined inANSI (1983). Listed are 17primary performance parameters that quantify theperformance criteria (speed, accuracy, and reliability) for the three communication system functions (access,user information transfer, anddisengagement). Thetable also shows four ancillary parameters that relate the user's impact onthe speed ofthe three system functions. TheANSX3.102 performance parameters aredefined insuch awaythat they canbeapplied toanydata communication system orservice foralltopologies, protocols, codes, orother design characteristics (ANSI, 1987). They apply to both connection-oriented systems like thepublic-switched telephone network, and connectionless packet-switched networks like ARPANET. Also,unlike most standards, ANS X3.102 gives only the parameter definitions, not specific parameter values.Thevalues oftheparameters aredetermined bythecontext ofthe user's specific requirements. Additionally, only asubset ofthe performance parameters need bespecified ifitfully describes the user's performance requirements. 2.1.1 Access Four primary performance parameters andoneancillary performance parameter are defined for the access function.These parameters are Access Time, Incorrect Access Probability, Access Denial Probability, Access Outage Probability, andUser Fraction ofAccess Time (see Table 2). ANSI (1983) and Seitz and Grubb (1983) give justifications for the selection ofthese parameters andtheir mathematical definitions. Theaccess function isdefined asfollows: Theaccess function begins upo'_ issuance ofan\"access request\" signal oritsimplied equivalent attheinterface between auser andthedata communication system. Itends when the first bit ofsource user information isinput tothesystem (after connection establishment in connection-oriented services).

The accuracy performance criterion isdescribed bytheIncorrect Access Probability, the probability ofthe system making awrong connection. This parameter generally applies toconnection-oriented systems only, where the misconnection istypically due toswitching oraddress errors. The user dialing awrong number isnotincluded inthis parameter because that isnota system-caused error. The reliability performance criterion isdescribed bythe performance parameters Access _Denial Probability andAccess Outage Probability. Access Denial Probability isthe probability that thesystem will block theuser's call, e.g., \"all circuits arebusy.\" Access denial also occurs when thetime toaccess thesystem exceeds theAccess Time threshold depicted inFigure i. Asdefined inANSI (1983), theAccess Time threshold isthree times themean Access Time. Ifanaccess attempt exceeds this threshold itiscounted asan Access Denial. The Access Outage Probability isthe probability that the | system does notrespond totherequest forservice, e.g., theuser does notget a\"dial tone\" when he/she picks upthephone toplace acall. This outage is duetopart orallofthesystem being \"down.\" The ancillary performance parameter associated with access isthe User Fraction ofAccess Time. This isthelength oftime theusers areresponsible forprocessing theaccess request, e.g., thelength oftime ittakes to\"dial\" thenumber andanswer thephone. 2.1.2 User Information Transfer Eleven primary performance parameters and one ancillary performance parameter are defined for the user information transfer function.

Theuser _i information transfer function isdefined asfollows: i Theuser information transfer function begins when theaccess function ends. The user information transfer function ends when the last \"disengagement request\" inaparticular data communication session is issued. Itincludes all formatting, transmission, storage, error control, and media conversion activities performed between start of transfer and completion of delivery, including any needed retransmissions within thesystem. Thespeed performance criterion isdescribed bytheBlock Transfer Time and User Information BitTransfer Rate. The Block Transfer Time istheaverage elapsed time between the start ofablock transfer attempt andaSuccessful Block Transfer, i.e., thelength oftime auser information block isintransit between thesource anddestination users. Aswith alltheblock parameters, a block ofuser information maybeanycontiguous stream ofbits that hasmeaning tothe users, e.g., asingle ASCII character (7bits) ora128-byte X.25 packet.

These parameters areDisengagement Time, Disengagement Denial Probability, andUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time (see Table 2). ANSI (1983) andSeitz andGrubb (1983) give justifications for the selection ofthese parameters and their mathematical definitions. The disengagement function isasfollows: There isadisengagement function associated with each participant ina data communication sessi_m. Each disengagement function begins on issuance ofa\"disengagement request.\" The disengagement function ends, foreach user, when (i)disengagement hasbeen _\"qL'sted forth_it user; and (2) that user isable toinitiate anew access attempt. 151989010985-025 ........... •.............._____:::__:_.....'_:_ __•__:_i \"7\"_\"_..-_7_%_f_-71TI_T_7 '_'_i__'_ ....._ _7._.___\"__ !

The inputs totheprocess are the measurcment objectives and the digltal signals observed atthe user/system interfaces. The outputs from theprocess aretheestimated mean values and associated precision andvariability statistics (e.g., confidence limits, histograms, andregression coefficients) oftheperformance parameters selected tocharacterize thesystem (ANSI, 1987). Three measurement objectives aredefined inANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987): I.Absolute Performance Characterization. Establishing the performance baseline ofthesystem. 2.Simple Hypothesis Test. Measuring toseeifthesystem performance iswithin some previously stated bounds. 3.Ana1_J_[s ofFactor Effects. Measuring toseehowdifferent system configurations affect system performance. 161989010985-026 ]71989010985-027 Systemdesigners, service_oviders, andexperimenters are interested inthe first and third objectives for determining the basic systemperformance characteristics. Users areinterested inthesecond objective fordetermining ifthesystemmeets their performance requirements. Asshown inFigure 3,themeasurement process iscarried outinfour steps: I.Experiment Design. Adetailed experiment plan isdeveloped from the desired measurement objectives. Thespecific performance information tobecollected isidentified and individual test conditions set. 2.Data Extraction. Selected pairs ofdigital user/systeminterfaces aremonitored inreal time.Achronological event history ofthe nature and time relevant interface events occur isrecorded.

(ANSI [1987] presents anindepth description ofthese steps and gives a detailed example oftheANSX3.141 measurement process.) Thefirst step inusing ANSX3.141 formeasuring data communication system performance istodescribe auser-oriented view ofthedata communication system.This isdone bydefining whoorwhat theusers areand thespecific user/system interfaces. ANSI (1983) defines four data communication system user/system interfaces asshown inFigure 4. The,,scrs canrange from human operators toapplication programs running inhost computers. Itisalso possible for the users tobeother data communication systems; here the user/system interfaces arethesubsystem interfaces shown inFigure 5. During acommunication session, information istransferred across the monitored user/system orsubsystem _nterfaces. This information transfer constitutes an_nteraction with the system, referred tobyANS X3.102 as \"interface events.\" Certain keyinterface events areidentified asevents to becounted, timed, orcompared forcalculating theperformance parameter values (Seitz andGrubb, 1983). With the user/system interface andkey interface events identified, the measurement process iscarried out.

Miles (1984) presents adetailed discussion onsample size selection and precision for data communication performance measurements. Additionally, Miles (1984) offers aFORTRAN computer program tobeused incol_unction with the system performance measurements experiment that calculates the required sample size and independence of population samples. Insummary, ANSX3.102 provides ameans ofcomparing \"apples\" and\"oranges\" bydefining a\"common yardstick\" formaking andspecifying system performance measurements, while ANSX3.141 describes auniform way tousetheyardstick. Asdiscussed inSection 4,this yardstick isvery useful fordescribing ways to measure andquantify ti'eACTS LowBur_;_ Rate (LBR) system performance. 3.COMMUNICATION SATELLITE END-TO-END SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DEFINITIONS This section applies the ANS X3.i02 and ANS X3.141 data communication system performance specification andmeasurement ideas detailed inSection 2to several classes ofcommunication satellites.

Since none ofthese systems include any switching ordynamic link control functions, communication system performance issimply equal totransmission link performance. 3.1.i TheLink Budget Thetwo-step process oflink budget andsystem capacity calculation isthe usual method for quantifying communication satellite link performance. The link budget calculation gives the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) for analog systems, andthebitenergy-to noise density ratio (Eb/No) fordigital transmission systems. The system capacity calculation gives the number of voice circuits orvideo channel= ananalog system cansupport andtheuser bit rate adigital system cansu[,port.

User-oriented system performance concerns for types Aand Bdigital satellite links canbegrouped into thethree ANSX3.102 performance categories ofspeed, accuracy, andreliability discussed inSection 2.These categories arequantified by5ofthe21ANSX3.102 system performance parameters: Bit Error Probability, Block Error Probability, Block Transfer Time, User Information Bit Transfer Rate, and Transfer Denial Probability (Table 4). These five parameters areselected entirely from theuser information transfer function category ofANSX3.102. This selection isreasonable because with dedicated point-to-point digital satellite links users have full time access; thus, Access and disengagement functions are r;ot encountered during normal operation. Also since there arenoswitching orstore-and-forward functions, data entering the system follows only one path; thus, there are no opportunities for user bits oruser data blocks tobeduplicated, lost, or misrouted.

Transfer Denial Probability Transfer denial occurs when the transmission quality ofthe link has degraded toapoint that the Bit Error Probability orUser Information Bit Transfer Rate isworse than aspecified threshold (see Section 2). However, fordedicated point-to-point systems, theUser Information BitRate isconstant and thus would not contribute totransfer denial.Increased Pedue tosun outages andrain fades are theprimary cause.Sunoutages occur twice ayear when the satellite eclipses the sun during the spring and autumn equinox, causing theearth station system noise temperature torise, thus increasing the Pe. Sunoutages last about twotosixl_inutes adayforatwo- tofour-day period.Rain fades are due tothe increased propagation loss and thus increased Pecaused bylocal rain storms.Thelimiting case oftransfer denial probability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., thesystem is \"down\" because ofanequipment failure. TheTransfer Denial Probability canbe thought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. There are distinct advantages inusing the ANS X3.102 performance parameters for quantifying type Aand Bcommunication satellite system performance. First,byusing these parameters,theuser isable toevaluate how well these satellite systems meet their requirements, how various configurations orfactors (e.g., QPSK modulation vsBPSK modulation) affect the 261989010985-036 performance, andhow these satellite systems compare with other transmission systems oradvanced switching communication satellites.

Ifthelink budget has been calculated, the Bit/Block Error Probability andUser Information BitTransfer Rate areknown. TheTransfer Denial Probability canbedetermined from rain fade models (see Pritchard andSciulli, 1986) andtheBlock Transfer Time isknown apriori. If thelink budget parameters arenotavailable, link performance canbemeasured byend-to-end system performance experiments similar tothose mentioned in Section 4.3.4 and described inANSI (1987).These experiments are greatly simplified fortype Aandtype Bcommunication satellite systems because the stazt ofblock transfer andtheendofblock transfer aretheonly reference events that need tobeobserved. 3.2 TDMA,SS/TDMA,andDAMA System Performance Parameters Time-dlvlslon multlple-access, SS/TDMA (type C),and DAMA communication satellite systems operate inatime-divlslon multiplex (TDM) fashion with typically only one carrier presented toasatellite transponder atatime. Each earth station inthenetwork buffers itsincoming terrestrial data traffic (ordigital signals from digital speech interpolation [DSI] processors), then transmits ittothe satellite atapreassigned time inahigh-rate burst (120 Mb/s forINTELSAT VI). The primary advantage ofTDMA systems isreduced traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) intermodulation distortion from having only onecarrier ata time. This allows more efficient useofthetransponder andgreater down-link power, because the TWTA can beoperated closer tosaturation. Another advantage isreduced earth station equipment costs forhigh-volume networks (Campanella etal.,1986). There are many TDMA systems currently planned and inoperation. The simplest, such asINTELSAT V(Trusty etal., 1986),use types Aand B communication satellites with global coverageand operate onapreassigned burst t:me plan (BTP) basis. SS/TDMA systems, such asINTELSAT VI(Trusty et al., 1986), use type Ccommunication satellites with switchable spot coverage antennas. These satellite-switched systems maximize the throughput ofthe 271989010985-037 r........... ............7 as-needed basis, thus reducing thenumber ofpermanently assigned transponders.

DAMA systems, such asSatellite Business Systems (SBS) and TELECOM i (Feher, 1983), operate onashort-term orreal-time BTPassignment mode. These demand-assignment systems further enhance the flexibility and throughput of TDMA systems bychanging the system configuration (BTP) i,_tea] time to accommodate changes inthenetwork traffic load. This isaccomplished byusing different preassigned BTPs orgenerating new BTPs inreal time astraffic demands change. From the user's perspective, all TDMA systems operate onaconnection- oriented basis. Once the circuit has been established, the users have full-time access toitand all their information traverses the same path through the system. Detailed information onthe various TDMA network architectures, synchronization techniques andoperation concerns canbefound inFeher (1983). With these advanced communication satellite systems, thelink budget and capacity calculations are still useful tosystem designers and service providers for designing the system. But, these calculations donot fully quantify the system's performance from the user's perspective. Therefore, using ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 becomes very useful forquantifying theend-to- endsystem performance ofthese satellite systems. The following subsection discusses how the 21ANS X3.102 performance parameters relate tothevarious TD_ communication satellite systems. Each performance parameter isexamined and related tospecific system operation events. Table 4lists the performance parameters deemed applicable tothe various TDMA systems discussed. The final selection ofthe performance parameters for quantifying aparticular system isuptotheuser andhis/her specific system performance requirements. However, theend-to-end performance parameters discussed below provide astarting point forquantifying TDMA system performance from the user's perspective and designing system performance experiments around theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. 3.2.1 Access Access methods andtimes forthevarious TDMA systems differ.

This canrange from acouple ofhours tomonths ahead ofwhen the circuit isneeded (Trusty etal., 1986). User access toDAMA systems that generate new BTPs inreal time takes afew milliseconds toafewminutes. Therefore, theapplication ofthefour access parameters islimited totheDAMA systelns generating BTPchanges inreal time. Access Time Access Time forDAMA systems isthetime from user issuance ofacircuit request tothestartoftheuser's data transmission. Thetime synchronizing theuser's earth station tothenetwork isnot included intheAccess Time parameter asthis isnotrequired each time anew circuit isestablished. Access Time isone ofthe most significantparameters for quantifying DAMA system performance. Incorrect Access Probability Incorrect _ccess Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability of establishing a_zircuit with thewrong destination. Transmission errors during thecircuit request orgeneration and distribution ofthenew BTPs are the mechanisms for establishing anincorrect connection. However, inproperly designed DAMA networks, these errors arekept lowbytheuseoferror detection andcorrection techniques. Additionally, ifanerrored BTPisimplemented, the network will lose synchronization and\"crash\" before theincorrect connection wasmade. Therefore, duetoitslowprobability ofoccurrence, theIncorrect Access Probability parameter isnot included inthe set ofDAMA system performance parameters. Access Denial Probability Access Denial Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability ofnot establi&hing acircuit tothedesired destination. Theprimary cause ofaccess denial islack ofsystem capacity toaccommodate anadditional circuit.

The Access OutageProbability, along with theTransfer Denial Probability discussed below gives anindication ofsystem availability andtherefore, isincluded in thesetofDAMA system performanceparameters. 3.2.2 User Information Transfer Theuser information transfer forallTDMA systems ishandled thesame way asforanyconnectlon-oriented digital communication system,Thepath through thesystem fortheuser's data does notchangefortheduration ofthecall. However,theparameters areaffected differently bythevarious TDMA systems, andnotallparameters pertain toallsystems. BitError Probability Bit Error Probability istheprobability that atransmitted bitwill be received inerror. This isthe same asPeused inlink performance measurements andlink budget calculations oftypes AandBsatellite syste.,,s. AsBit Error Probability isone ofthe most: zommon measures ofdigital communication system performance, itisincluded inthe setofTDMA system performance parameters. BitMisdellvery Probability Bit Misdel_.very Probability isthe probabillty that asingleuser information bitisdelivered tothewrong destination. Inconnectlon-orlented systems, likethevarious TDMA systems discussed, user information bitsfollow only onepath through thesystem.Also, asTDMA systems process theuser data inmultibit subbursts, itisunlikely that asingle bit would bemisrouted. Therefore, Bit Misdelivery Probability isnot included intheset ofTDMA system performance parameters. 301989010985-040 BitLoss Probability The BitLoss Probability istheprobability that auser information bit entering the system does notreach theintended destination. Again, asTDMA systems areconnection-oriented, user information bits have only onepath to follow. However, ifthe TDMA frame-synchronizing unique word (UW) isnot detected for asignificant number offrames, the local terminal clock will begin todrift, causing theframe boundaries toshift and theTDMA control buff_ tooverflow, thus loosing user data bits.

(Feher i1983] discusses uniqueword detection andprobabilities ofmissesandfalse alarms.) Also,if theuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe earth station clock, a \"clock sllp\" can occur.This iswhen theclock reading data out ofaTDMA buffer differs from theclock writing datainto thebuffer. Iftheread clock isslightly slower then thewrite clock, thebuffer will eventually overflow andhits will belost. Additionally, deep fades onthelink would cause large blocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost. BitLoss Probability isincluded inthe setofTDMA system performance parameters. ExtraBitProbability < TheExtra BitProbability istheprobability that areceived data bitwasa i duplicate bit orabit intended for another destination. Like the Bit I l Misdelivery Probability andBitLoss Probability, theExtra BitProbability is very low for connection-oriented systems. However, ifthe TDMA frame- synchronizing UWisdeclared present, when inreality itisnot, the TDMA control buffer empties prematurely, thus sending extraneous orduplicate bits. Also, extrabits can begenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheread clock is slightly faster then thewrite clock, thebuffer will empty, causing data bits tobeclocked outtwice andtobecounted asextra bits. The Extra BitProbability and theBitLoss Probability give ameasure of the UWdetector performance and the local earth station clock stability. Therefore, Extra Bit Probability isincluded inthe set ofTDMA system performance perameters. BlockTransfer Time BlockTransfer TimeforTDMA systems isthetime required fordatablocks i! tobefeed into andtraverse thesystem. Thecounting ofBlock Transfer Time 311989010985-041 starts with auser information block crossing the originating user/system interface and ends when the same block crosses the destination user/system interface. Any additional delay beyond the 270 mspropagation delay ofa single-hop satellite circuit and themodulation time gives ameasure ofthe additional buffering required inTDMA systems. Therefore, Block Transfer Time isincluded inthesetofTDMA performance. Block Error Probability Block Error Probability isclosely related totheBit Error Probability, theprobability that ablock ofuser information isreceived inerror. Oneor more incorrect bits inablock constitute ablock error. Therefore, the measurement ofBlock Error Probability isalso included"}, {"id": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards__28", "source": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards.pdf", "chunk_index": 28, "text": "time gives ameasure ofthe additional buffering required inTDMA systems.

Block Error Probability Block Error Probability isclosely related totheBit Error Probability, theprobability that ablock ofuser information isreceived inerror. Oneor more incorrect bits inablock constitute ablock error. Therefore, the measurement ofBlock Error Probability isalso included inthe TDMA system performance parameters. Block Misdelivery Probability Block Misdelivery Probability isthe probability that areceived user information block was inteuded foranother destination. Theprimary cause of ? block misdeliveries are undetected errors inthe circuit request address information orBTPgeneration anddistribution. Hewever, errors intheaddress information would cause anincorrect access and thus becounted inthe Incorrect Access Probability calculation. Errors inBTP generation and distribution would allow TDMA bursts orsubbursts tobetransmitted atthe wrong time, misrouting data, andthus misdelivering auser's information block. However,asmentioned for the Incorrect Access Probability parameter, BTP errors would cause the TDMAnetwork tolose synchronization and fail. Therefore, due toits low probability ofoccurrence, Block Misdelivery Probability isnotincluded inthesetofTDM_ system performance parameters. Block Loss Probability Block Loss Probability for TDMA systems isthe probability that an information block does notreach thedestination within tbespecified maximum transfer time due toexcessively long transfer delays orlost blocks. The specified maximum transfer time isthree times the Block Transfer Time (ANSI, 1983). Since the B]ock Transfer Time isexpected toberelatively constant, theprimary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probabl]ity would be thesystem mlsrouting orloslng blocks. Hisrouting blocks wasdiscussed for Block Misdeli_ery Probability. Losing blocks would belikely during deep fades onsystems notusing anyform ofARQprotocol. IfanARQprotocol isused, a transmission error cancause anegative acknowledgement (NAK) tobechanged to apositive acknowledgement (ACK),thus blocks requiring retransmission would be lost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware and software \"crashes\" where thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. Block Loss Probability isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. Extra Block Probability Extra Block Probability istheprobability that aduplicate block ofuser information isdelivered tothe destination user.

Insystems using an _Qprotocol, anACKthat islost orchanged toaNAKcauses theunacknowledged information blocks tobcretransmitted. Extra Block Probability isincluded in thesetofTDMA system performance parameters. User Information BitTransfer Rate TheUser Infor,aation BitTransfer Rate forTDMA systems isdefined asthe total number ofsuccessful bit transfers divided bythe time required to transfer them. Itisthe same asthe Rbparameter used tospecify the throughput oftypes AandBcommunication satellites. Because _heTDMA systems areconnection oriented,norate conversion occurs; thus, theinput andoutput data rates areequal asrepresented bycase iofFigure 2.Therefore, either theinput oroutput maybeexamined formeasuring thetransfer rate. TheUser Information BitTransfer Rate isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. Transfer Denial Probability Transfer denial for TDMA systems isthe same as_or types Aand B communication satellite systems (see Section 3.1.2). Itoccurs when the transmission quality ofthe link hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError Probability orUser Information BitTr_sfer Rate isworse than thespecified threshold (see Section 2). Increased Peduetosunoutages andrain fades are again theprimary cause.Because theUser Information BitRate isrelatively constant,itwould not contribute totransfer denial. The limiting case of 1989010985-043 transfer denial probability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., I the system is\"down\" because ofanequipment failure. The Transfer Denial Probability issimilar totheOutage parameter used interrestrial microwave systems and can bethought ofastheinverseofsystemavailability. Therefore,itisincluded inthesetofTDMA system performanceparameters. 3.2.3 Disengagement Disengagement, like access, depends onthe specificnetwork design and user/system interfaces. Also, llke access, disengagement isapplicableonly to theDAMA systems generating BTPchanges inreal time. Disengagement Time Disengagement Time isthe elapsed time fromauser _ssuing acircuit disconnection request towhen that user can make another circuit request.

Theprimary causes fordisengagement denial arethesame asthose forincorrect access--errors inthe request orBTP generation and distribution. Because these errors are rare due tothe network error detection and correction techniques, Disengagement Denial Probability isnotincluded inthesetofDAMA system performance parameters. 3.2.4 Ancillary Parameters The ancillary parameters quantify theimpact onsystem performance due to theuser's interaction with thesystem. The following discussion identifies andestimates theuser's influence onsystem performance, described bythefour ancillary performance parameters, forthevarious TDMA systems. li UserFractionofAccessTime TheUser Fraction ofAccessTime isapplicabletoDAMA systems.Itisthe time ittakes auser toissue anaccess request andenter the destination 34 i1989010985-044 address information (i.e., \"dial thenumber\"), andforthedestination user to answer. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, this parameter would besmall, thus Access Time would bedominated bythe DAMA system operation. But, iftheusers arehuman operators with telephones,Access Time would bedominated bytheusers interactions. TheUser Fraction ofAccess Time indicates how much involvement theuser has inthe system operation. This parameter isincluded inthesetofDAMA system performance parameters. User Fraction ofBlockTransfer Time TheUser Fraction offlock Transfer Time isthetime ittakes togenerate a block ofuser's data. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, the user information blocks areusually ready fortransfer;thus, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time would besmall. However, ifthe users are human operators, where theblocks areassembled attheuser's terminal andtheblock assembly depends ontheoperator's typing speed, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time becomes asignificant part oftheoverall Block Transfer Time.

These areprimarily using thesatellite asatrunk between ISDN switches oraswitch and the local user/network interface. For the broad bandwidth interswitch trunks, simple type Aandtype Bcommunication satellites, orany oftheTDMA systems areusable. Fortherelatively lowbandwidth links between ISDN switches anduser/network interfaces, narrow-band TDMA systems using only apart ofatransponder (Pritchard andSciulli, 1986) andvery-small-aperture terminals (VSATs) areappropriate. The next step isfor the satellite itself tobecome anISDN switch. Advanced satellites, like NASA's ACTS with onboard switching, (see Section 4) would provide this capability. These satellites inaVSAT network would support ISDN user/network interfaces atthebasic 2B+D (144 kb/s) channel rate orprimary 23B+D (1.544 Mb/s) channel rate.

Theperformance oftheB-channels (connection oriented circuit switched) canbequantified bytheperformance parameters identified forDAMA satellite systems. Theperformance oftheD-channels (packet switched) will require thecomplete setof21performance parameters tofully describe their performance. End-to-end system performance experiments for these satellite-augmented ISDNs canbedesigned using theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. These experiments would befundamentally the same asDAMAsatellite and ACTS system performance experiments. 4.ACTS OVERVIEW, OPERATION, ANDEND-TO-END SYSTEM P_FO_CE DEFINITIONS TheAdvanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) isthethird phase ofthe NASA 30/20 GHz program. Phase one was thedevelopment ofadvanced 30/20 GHzcommunication satellite technologies andlaboratory proof-of-concept 36 i1989010985-046 (POC) models.

The final architecture andprotocols ofcommercia] systems maybevastly different from ACTS. However, ACTS will provide astarting point for designing such an advanced communication satellite systems. ACTS will basically operate asaswitched digital communication network. Assuch, itbecomes desirable toquantify its performance from theuser's perspective. This will provide abasis for evaluating how acommercial advanced communication satellite system performs from theuser's perspective andwill help identify theperformance impact ofthevarious ACTS technologies. The primary focus ofthis section istopresent astandard method for quantifying ACTS system performance. 371989010985-047 The section isdivided into three subsections. The first gives abrief system overview and operation description ofthe ACTS low burst rate (LBR) mode. Thesecond discusses howthe21ANSX3.102 performance parameters, introduced inSection 2,relate toperformance oftheACTS LBRmode. Andthe third discusses the basic design requirements for anACTS LBR system ! performance experiment using theframework ofANSX3.141. 4.1 ACTS Overview andOperation This subsection provides abrief introductory description of the ACTS LBRsystem and anoverview ofits operation. Inukai, etal. (1988), Naderi and Campanella (1988), and Wright (1986) offer additional in-depth information onthecapabilities andoperation ofACTS. 4I.i ACTS LBRSystem Overview .

Through theorder wires, theuser's request service, in64kb/s increments, from 64kb/s upto approximately 6.1 Mb/s. Therefore, from the user's per_-ective the ACTS network behaves more like acircuit-switched network then apacket network. Another advanced technology feature ofACTS isthemultibeam communication package (MCP). Multiple small uoverage area (approximately 150kmindiameter) spot and scanning beam antennas with cross polarization areused instead of global orwide area coverage antennas. This allows greater frequency reuse and higher gain antennas onthesatellite. Figure 6illustrates theproposed ACTS coverage area. During each l-ms TDMA frame, all earth stations requiring service are illuminated. Like true DAMA satellite systems, theACTS circuit routing andcoverage area canbeprogramed inreal time toaccommodate changes inuser traffic demands. 3819890109851048 391989010985-049 During each TDMA frame thespot beam (orscanning beam inthescan sector) stops (dwells) oneach area with active earth stations. During thedwell, each earth station transmits and receives itsuser traffic. Onthe terrestrial side, theearth stations receive acontinuous data stream from theusers (upto 6.144 Mb/s or96equivalent 64kb/s voice circuits). Theearth stations buffer and segment this incoming data into 64-bit-long words. These words are packaged into messages. Atapredetermined slot inthe TDMA frame, the messages aretransmitted inaii0Mb/s burst. These bursts arereceived atthe satellite, demodulated and demultiplexed back tothe 64kb/s baseband, and stored intheBBP input memory. During thenext frame, the contents ofthe memory aretransferred through theBBP routing switch totheappropriate BBP output memory. Then during thethird frame, thecontents oftheBBPoutput memory are transmitted inaii0 Mb/s burst inaTDM fashion during the appropriate down link spot dwell.

Another ACTS techno _ demonstration isindependent rain fade compensation for the uplink and down link. This isdone with adaptive forward error correction (FEC) coding andburst rate reduction. Forexample, ifarain fade isdetected onthe uplink, theuplink signal isencoded with arate-I/2 cenvolutional code andtransmitted atareduced burst rate, thus increasing the link budget margin. When ::hesignal isdemodulated onboard thesatellite, it isdecoded andtheoriginal baseband bits arerecovered. Iffade compensation isrequired onthedown link, thesignal isencoded onboard thesatellite and transmitted atalower burst rate tothe destination earth station, again increasing thelink budget margin. Since itisunlikely that theoriginating terminal uplink and destination terminal down link will suffer rain fades simultaneously, thesignal isonly encoded onthelink that requires it;the clear link istransmitted uncoded atthenormal burst rate. With onboard signal regeneration, FECcoding, andburst rate reduction, it ispossible tosupport single-hop VSAT-to-VSAT communications. With type Aand Bcommunication satellite systems, ifaVSAT wishes tocommunicate with another VSAT, thetraffic must first berouted toalarge central hubterminal where it isregenerated and retransmitted tothedestination VSAT. This involves two satellite hops, thus increasing the propagation delay and making voice 401989010985-050 communications difficult (Glen etal., 1976). However, with ACTS, the satellite performs thefunction ofthecentral hub station, thus reducing the number ofh)ps andfacilitating acceptable voice communication. 4.1.2 ACTS LBRSystem Operation TheACTS LBRsystem uses portions oftheTDMA frame asorder wire channels tocarry network control information. Figure 7shows theflow ofthis control information through the various TDM_ bursts ofthe uplink and down link frames.

TheACTS LBRTDMA frame isdivided into 1728 slots orwords, each 64bits long, equating tothe110.592 Mb/s transmission rate. Every 75th frame (every 75ms)isdeclared asuperframe. TbeMCSsends oneoutbound order wire message per frame, user earth stations send one inbound order wire message per superframe. Figure 10 shows the time sequence for establishing, using, and disconnecting a64kb/s _CTS LBR circuit. The sequence begins with auser signaling theoriginating user earth st_tion thathe/she wishes toplace a call. Theoriginating user's earth station transmits, via theinbound order wire, acircuit requestmessage containing thedestination user's earth station identification number and the circuitidentification number. The circuit identification number isused toidentify thecircuit throughout itsexistence andconsists oftheterrestrial channel number andtheoriginating user's earth st_zion identification number. Thecircuit request message also hasastation- co-station communications field forterrestrial circuit signaling information. After receiving and processing the circuit request message, the MCS allocates uplink anddown link capacity andassigns TDMA frame slots. Italso stores thi:_ assignment information inanactive circuit tile listing the current resources allocated toeach circuit inthenetwork. Itthen sends a c_rcuit assignment message via the outbound order wire tothe circuits originating anddestination earth stations.

Aswasdone inSection 3 for the various Tbe_ satellite communication systems, each ANS X3.102 performance parameter isexamined andrelated totheACTS LBRmode operation. Included inthis discussion isthe examination ofhow and towhat extent various mechanisms within the ACTS LBR system affect theestimates for the performance parameters.

Table 5identifies theperformance parameters deemed applicable totheACTS LBRsystem. 4.2.1 Access The exact method ofuser access tothe ACTS LBR system depends onthe specific user/system interface used. The originating user requests a connection then waits until thecircuit isestablished andthedestination user hasanswered before transmitting anydata. Since theACTS LBRsystem isatrue DAMA satellite system generating new BTPs inreal time, access function performance isofinterest. Generic descriptions ofthefour performance parameters associated with the access function are given inSection 2,Seitz and Grubb (1983), and ANSI (1983). Access Time Access Time fortheACTS LBRsystem istheelapsed time from auser issuing aservice request tothestart oftheuser's data transmission. Itisassumed that theuser's earth station issynchronized tothenetwork; thus, only the call request _ust beprocessed. Asdescribed inSection 4.1.2, thecircuit is available foruseonly after thenewBTPhasbeen implemented. Ifmany circuit requests must beprocessed, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil allofthe requests canbeserved. Thus, Access Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic load, the number ofconnection/disengagement requests, and the number of 481989010985-058 49IIIIHIIIIIII- -HillI_'_'\"_'\"_\" '+'_e-':'+\" :\"_...... 1989010985-059 stations requiring FEC coding (FEC coding requires additional BTP changes).

Incorrect Access Probability Incorrect Access would occur intheACTS LBRsystem ifthere areundetected bit errors inthe inbound order wire address information totheMCS orthe BBPTP information from theMCStotheDRP. However, because cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) are used within the order wire and control information fields, undetected errors would befew. WRen anerror isdetected, therequest is ignored andaccess isdenied. Therefore, because ofthis lowprobability of occurrence and thedifficulty inmeasuring thenumber ofincorrect accesses, theIncorrect Access Parameter isnot included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters.

Inthis case theBTPmaynotbeable toaccept anyadditional user traffic, orthe source ordestination earth stations might not beable to accommodate theextra bandwidth required foranadditional circuit. System capacity isreduced aud thus Access Denial Probability isincreased ifany I earth stations intheparticular dwell area require fade compensation. Also, ifthe destination earth station does not have any terrestrial circuits available, itwill block thecall (byissuing adisengagement request). Minor system/component failures would also cause Access Denial, e.g., the destination earth station is\"down\" ornot yet synchronized tothenet .rk. Additionally, biterrors ontheinbound order wire during acapacity request would cause theMCStoignore therequest, thus denying access. ! Access Denial due toexcessive delays ispassible. The threshold for T access denial, asshown inFigure i,isdefined asthree times themean system i Access Time. Therefore, under excessively heavy traffic conditions thecall ,_{ request processing time oftheMCS may exceed this threshold, thus denying 501989010985-060 T3 ? access. Also, iftheMCSdetermines that thecall cannot becompleted, the request isdiscarded. Measuring theAccess Denial Probability isuseful fordetermining thetrue system capacity andidentifying hardware andsoftware bottle necks.

AccessOutage Probability Access outages intheACTS LBRsystem canoccur foranumber ofreasons: theoriginating user's earth station is\"down;\" thecapacity requestmessages arerejected duetohigher channel error rate from aheavy, local rain storm; the MCS isnot operational; orthe satellite isscheduled for some other experiment andthus notavailable forLBRuse.

Therefore, Access Outage Probability isnot included in thesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.2 User Information Transfer The user information transfer for the ACTS LBR system islike other connection oriented digital communication systems. Thepath throu6n thesystem fortheuser's data does nutchange fortheduration ofthecall. The ANS X3.102 block-oriented user information transfer parameters are associated with transporting user defined information units. Normally users define block lengths that arecompatible with their data processing equipment orhigher layer protocols, regardless ofhowthecommunication system packages their data. However, because theACTS LBRsystem handles alldata in64-bit increments, when looking atsystem level performance, ablock isdefined as 64user bits. This does notseverely limit theusefulness ofthese performance parameters asmost common user defined blocks areinteger multiples of64bits. Generic descriptions oftheiiperformance parameters associated with the user information transfer function are given inSection 2and inSeitz and 511989010985-061 i Grubb (1983). These bit and block parameters are transfer described mathematically inANSI (1983). BitError Probability The Bit Error Probabi]ity isthe same parameter that isused inlink performance measurements andlink power budget calculations oftypes AandB satellite systems. Itisafunction ofthechannel signal-to-noise ratio and transmission rate (see Appendix). The ACTS LBR system has aBit Error Probability design goa] of]0-6 Because BitError Probability isoneofthe most common measures ofdigital communication system performance itisincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. BitMisdelivery Probability Inconnection o_iented systems, such asACTS, once auser information bit enters the system ithas only on_ path tofollow and thus will reach the desired destination. Also, because theACTS LBRsystem handles theuser data in64bit blocks, itwo1:id bevery unlikely that asingle bit would be misrouted.

Therefore, BitMisdelivery Probability isnotincluded intheset ofACTS performance parameters. BitLoss Probability Again, once auser information bitenters thesystem ithasonly onepath tofollow. However, iftheuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe local earth station clock, ortheearth station clock isnotsynchronized with ACTS, a\"clock slip\" canoccur.Iftheread clock isslightly slower then the write clock, thebuffer will eventually fill andlose bits. Additionally, deep fades onthelink would cause large blocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost, thus contributing tothevalue ofthis parameter. Even though theprobability oflosing abitintheACTS LBRsystem islow, BitLoss Probabi].ity isincluded inthesetofsystem performance parameters. Coupled with theBitError Probability, theBitLoss Probability gives agood indication ofthe transmission link performance and thesystems immunity to fades. 521989010985-062 Extra BitProbability Like theBitMisdelivery Probability andBit loss Probability, theExtra BitFrobability isvery lowforconnection oriented systems.However, extra bits canbegenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheearth station's terrestrial interface elastic buffer read clock isslightly faster then thewrite clock, thebuffer will empty, causing data bits tobeclocked outtwice andcounted as extra bits.

Block Transfer !i Time isoneofthe significant ACTS LBRperformance parameters andtherefore included inthesetofparameters.

Because ofthis andthedifficulty ofcollecting enough data tocalculate the probability with ahigh degree ofreliability, the Block Misdelivery Probability isnot included inthe set ofACTS LBR system performance parameters. Block Loss Probability The primary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probability would be misrouted orlost blocks. Block loss would bepossible during deep transmission link fades.

Additionally, iftheusers areusing anARQprotocol andatransmission error causes aNAKtobechanged toanACK, anyblocks requiring retransmission would belost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware andsoftware \"crashes\" where thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. TheBlock Loss Probability fortheACTS LBRsystem isexpected tobelow, with themain cause being transmission fades. Block Loss Probability isan easy parameter tomeasure and therefore isincluded inthe set ofACTS LBR system performance parameters.

Since thelikelihood oftheACTS LBRsystem generating anextra block is lowandconcerns about theperformance ofuser's ARQprotocol areoutside the ACTS LBR system, the Extra Block Probability isnot included intheset of ACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 541989010985-064 User Information BitTransfer Rate FortheACTS LBRsystem theUser Information BitTransfer Rate isthebasic user rate of64kb/s, where the input rate and output rate are equal as represented bycase iofFigure 2.Therefore, User Information BitTransfer Rate isincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. Transfer Denial Probability Transfer Denial for the ACTS LBR system occurs when the transmission quality ofthelink hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError Probability or User Information Bit Transfer Rate are worse than aspecified threshold. ANSI (1983) defines this threshold fortheBitError Probability asthefourth root ofitsspecified value, andfortheUser Information BitTransfer Rate as one third ofitsspecified value. Sunoutages and rain fades cause theBit Error Probability toincrease, thus contributing totransfer denial. The limiting case oftransfer denial iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., the system is\"down\" due toequipment orsoftware failure. Transfer Denial Probability canbethought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. Because system availability isoften used tospecify communication s_te]lite system performance, Transfer Denial Probability becomes avaluable parameter andistherefore included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.3 Disengagement Thedisengagement function fortheACTS LBRsystem isthesame asforother connection oriented data communication system. Generic descriptions oithetwo performance parametecs associated wit:h thedisengagement function aregiven in Section 2and inSeitz and Grubb (1983). These parameters are described mathematically inANSI (1983).

The user's earth station then issues aCircuit Disconnect message totheMCSvia theinbound order wire. TheMCSinturnissues aDisconnect Acknowledgment to theearth stations viatheoutbound order wire. Thecounting ofDisengagement Time ends when theusers issue another access request,Ifthere are manv 5b1989010985-065 circuit requests, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil alltherequests are processed; thus, Disengagement Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic load, the number ofconnection/disengagement requests, andnumber ofterminals requiring FECcoding. Disengagement Time isasignificant performance parameter relating totheACTS LBRsystem performance. Therefore, itisincluded inthesetof ACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. Disengagement Denial Probability Disengagement denial for the ACTS LBRsystem could occur due to transmission bit errors during aCircuit Disconnect request orDisconnect Acknowledgment. IftheMCS receives aninvalid Circuit Disconnect request, i.e., thecircuit identified intherequest isnotontheactive circuit list, therequest isignored. Theearth station issuing therequest will repeat the disengagement request ifitdoes notreceive aDisconnect Acknowledgment within aspecified time. During deep fades, several Circuit Disconnect requests could beissued before theMCS acknowledges. Thus, there isthepossibility that a Disengagement Denial would bedeclared due toexcessive request pro_essing delay. Because theACTS LBR system uses CRCs ontheorder wire commands andFEC coding during fades, Disengagement Denial Probability would beinsignificant. Therefore, Disengagement Denial Probability isnot included inthe set of ACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.4 Ancillary Parameters Because these parameters rely entirely ontheuser, they arenotincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. This isnot toimply that they areunimportant. Anestimate oftheir impact onsystem performance isuseful for identifying performance problems and developing methods to improve the systems ease ofuse. The following discussion identifies and roughly estimates some oftheuser's influence onsystem performance forthe four ancillary performance parameters.

Table 6lists some ofthe ACTS LBR system factors (system configurations) andtheir levels that could bemeasured. Themost significant factors arethedifferent data rates, theeffect ofthefade compensation, and performance asafunction oftraffic load. 4.3.1 ACTS User/System Interfaces Thefirst task when designing auser-oriented system pe_formance experimeht istoidentify theuser/system interface.

The primary interface point isthe ACTS Central Office (CO) equipment, which looks and functions like a terrestrial, telephone system central office. Thespecific u.._r interface data rates andprotocols depend oiltheinterface options implemented int,,eACTS CO, but thebasic intent isforACTS toappear totheusers like aterrestrial telephone system.

The following isa mapping oftheACTS system operation into these reference events. [ i Access Request AnAccess Request occurs whenthe originating user signals the earth station that he/she wishes tocall another user. Theoriginating user's earth station then formats and transmits acircuit request message, which contains thedestination address, via itsinbound order wire totheMCS. Acircuit is established following theprocess outlined inSection 4.1.2. Theoccurrence of anaccess request signifies thestart oftheaccess time measurement. Nonoriginating User Commitment Theoriginating user receives a\"ring-back\" signal while thedestination user isbeing signaled. The Nonoriginating User Commitment occurs when the nonoriginating (destination) user answers the call. Incorrect access is eliminated asapossible access outcome when the desired destination user answers thecall. SystemBlocking Signal System Blocking Signals areissued only when theoriginating user's earth station cannot accommodate theca]l. Theoriginating user isnotnotified if thecall isblocked within theACTS LBRsystem (destination earth stations or i MCS). IftheMCScannot process thecall request, therequest isignored and theoriginating user will eventually abandon thecall. User Blocking Signal AUser Blocking Signal isissued when thedestinationuser iseither busy (the originating user receives a\"busy tone\") ordoes notanswer.Asdefined inANSI (1983),acall attempt blocked bythedestination user isexc]uded from thesystem performance measurements. i !1989010985-071 Start"}, {"id": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards__50", "source": "nasa-suitability-of-ansi-standards.pdf", "chunk_index": 50, "text": "stations or i MCS).

User Blocking Signal AUser Blocking Signal isissued when thedestinationuser iseither busy (the originating user receives a\"busy tone\") ordoes notanswer.Asdefined inANSI (1983),acall attempt blocked bythedestination user isexc]uded from thesystem performance measurements. i !1989010985-071 Start ofBlockInput ToSystem The Start ofBlockInput toSystemoccurs when the first bit ofuser information crosses theoriginating user/systeminterface. Themeasurement of access time isstopped when this event occurs. Start ofBlockTransfer Because theACTS LBR system isconnection-oriented, the Start ofBlock Transfer coincides with the Start ofBlock Input tothe system. The measurement ofblock transfer time isstarted when this event occurs. EndofBlock Transfer The End ofBlock Transfer occurs when the last bit oftheuser-defined information block crosses the destination user/system interface. The measurement ofblock transfer time isstopped when this event occurs. Disengagement Request ADisengagement Request occurs when either theoriginating ordestination user signals his/her earth station todisconnect thecall. Theearth station then formats and transmits acircuit disconnect message via theinbound order wire totheMCS. Theearth station originating thedisconnect request waits for con[irmation from the MCS before taking any further action. If confirmation does not arrive before atime out expires, the earth station retransmits the circuit disconnect message. The first Disengagement Request issued signifies thestart ofthedisengagement time measurement. Disengagement Confirmation Upon reception ofacircuit disconnect message, the MCS determines the validity oftherequest bychecking its list ofactive circuits forthe one identified inthedisconnect message. Ifthecircuit isonthelist, theMCS sends adisconnect acknowledgment message viatheoutbound order wire toboth earth stations using the circuit. Ifthe circuit isnot onthe list, the circuit disconnect message isdiscarded. TheDisengagement Confirmation allows both users toplace other calls. The measurement ofdisengagement time is stopped when the user making the originaldisengagement request isable to pla__.other ca]is. 6219890109R5-077 4.3.3Typical ACTSLBRSession Theabovereference events areextremely useful fordeveloping call session profiles.

With these session profiles and details about the specific user/system interfaces, the relevant interfaceevents needed for the data extraction step ofthemeasurement process canbeidentified. Asystem level session profileforatypical ACTS LBRcall isillustrated inFigure I0, with the applicable primary and ancillary reference events identified. (see ANSI [1987] foradiscussion onancillary reference events.) Inthis session, theoriginating user initiates thecall, transfers data, and then disengages thecall. Nouser data oracknowledgments aretransferred from thedestination user back totheoriginating user. Figure 12illustrates in greater detail theACTS LBRsystem actions during asuccessful access request. Thesession begins with theoriginating user going \"off hook,\" thus issuing anAccess Request (primary reference event I)asthe interface event. The originating user receives a\"dial tone\" from thelocal ACTS CO,indicating that he/she may enter the destination user's address. The system processes the request, signaling the destihation user. The originating user receives a \"ring-back\" indicating that thedestination user isbeing signaled.There are noprimary reference events associated with this system event atthe originating user's interface. .I Thedestination user co_,_its tothesession byanswering thecall (going \"off hook\"),thus initiating reference event 2astheinterface event.The originating user receives theindication that thedestinatlon user iswilling tocommunicate. Again there isnoprimary reference event associated with this interface event. The originating user starts the communication secsion, thus initiating reference events 5and6.There isnoprimary reference event defined forthe interface event ofthedestination user receiving thedata. Thecommunication session continues inthis fashion until thelast bitof user information has been transferred across the origination user/system interface.

Thedestination user then issues a disconnectrequesttoitslocal interface. Finally, after processing the disconnectrequests, the MCS issues a disconnectacknowledgment (primary reference event9)toboth user's earth stations. Ifthere isaneed toaccommodate additional circuitrequests, the MCS will develop and distribute anew BTP. Atthis time the system is available foranother call. Session profiles similar toFigures i0,12,and 13canbedrawn forthe ACTS LBRsystem high-volume trunk andbroadcast modes. Themain difference is the need for multiple access and disconnectrequests toestablish the extra circuits. Access requests canbeblocked atseveral locations intheACTS LBRsystem, thus contributing tothe Access Denial Probability and Access Outage Probability discussed inSection 4.2.1. Acause ofaccess blocking isshovel in Figure 14where theMCSignores thecircuit request. This would beduetothe system operating close tooratcapacity orthecircuit request message was received inerror and thus ignored. Inthis case theoriginating user will eventually goback \"onhook,\" abandoning thecall attempt iftheconnection is notmade. Another form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination earth station cannot process the call request. This woula bedue toequipment problems with its local COorlack ofavailable COtrunks. Asshown in Figure 15,when thedestination earth station isblocking thecall, itsends a circuit disconnect message totheMCS. Noindication ofblocking issent to theoriginating user, however, and they will eventually goback \"onhook,\" abandoning thecall attempt. Onefinal form ofaccess blocking occurs when thedestination user isbusy. Asshown inFigure 16,thedestination ACTS COnotes that thedestination user isbusy andsends a\"busy tone\" back totheoriginating user indicating user blocking (primary reference event 4).

Theoriginating user's computer automatically calls the destination user's computer, transfers apreset number ofpseudorandom datafiles, and then disconnects the call. Both user/system interfaces are monitored. Ateach step oftheaccess, transfer, anddisengagement functions, therelevant interface events arerecorded and time stamped. Files ofthese time stamped reference events along with copies ofthetransferred data files are stored inboth user's computers. Inthe data reduction step ofthe measurement process, estimates ofthe\"speed\" parameters aregenerated from the time-stamped reference event files and estimates ofthe \"accuracy\" and \"reliability\" parameters aregenerated bycomparing thesource anddestination copies ofthepseudorandom data files. 5.CONCLUSION Ithasbeen established that theANSI system performance standards canbe used tomeasure andcompare theperformance ofvastly different communication systems, most notably communication satellite systems.

Intermodu!ation distortion ismore prevalent inFM/FDM/FDMA systems with multiple carriers andcontributes tothequantities known asAM-AM andAM-PM ] co_.0ersion and crosstalk.

Problems with intermodulation distortion highlight the advantages of i digital modulation andTDMA systems, _ith most digital modulation techniques, _ the signal has aconstant envelope, thus reducing the AM-AM and AM-PM conversion and intermodulation products. With TDMA systems there isonly one carrier present atatime, thus intermodulation distortion ise,,en further J reduced.

Pritchard andSciulli (1986) dothis forvarious channel multiplex hierarchies. They also expand these basic equations tocover multiple channel percarrier andtelevision applications, including preemphasis andpsophometric weighing factors typically specified FMmultiplex systems. System capacity calculations fordigital transmission systems aresomewhat simplified. Thebasic unit ofmeasure isthebitenergy-to-noise density ratio (Eb/No). ForBPSK Eb/No isdirectly related toC/No by Eb/No =C/No xTb [12] where Tb=thetransmitted bitduration inseconds and =i/Rb (the inverse ofthetransmitted bitrate). For power limited satellite communication systems, Figure A-I shows the theoretical relationship between biterror probability andEb/No. Inpractical systems this relationship also depends onthemodulation techniques anderror correction coding used, Feher (1983) andWhalen (1971) discuss atlength, the I:i relationships ofPe,Eb/No, modulation, andcoding. With therequired Pe,andknowledge ofthemodulation techniques anderror correction coding used, the required Eb/No can befound from graphs like Figure A-I. From this, and thesatellite link C/No, thechannel transmitted bitrate canbefound by 801989010985-089 Figure #-i.Biterror ratevs.Eb/No. 811989010985-090 Rb-(CINo)/(Eb/No). [13] Theuser's data rate isrelated tothetransmitted bitrate bythemodulation technique anderror correction coding used. InTDMA systems, theuser's data rate also depends onthelength oftheTDMA frame andnumber ofoverhead bits inthevarious control andsynchronization fields. Feher (1983) andPritchard andSciulli (1986) discuss TDMA frame structures, synchronization techniques, andsystem capacity calculations. Using the_elationsh_p ofEb/No andPefrom Figure A-l, theadvantage of onboard digital signal regeneration iseasily shown.

A.The sum of gains and losses in various parts of the system has to result in satisfactory performance (typically, output S/N or BER). 2.The design of any communication link is based on: A.Meeting of minimum C/N ratio for a specific percentage of time. B.Carrying the maximum revenue earning traffic at minimum cost. 3.Link-power budget calculations take into account all the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the propagation medium to the receiver in a communication system. Also taken into the account are the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, and the loss or gain due to the antenna. Link calculations often determine the maximum distance at which a transmitter and receiver can successfully operate.
