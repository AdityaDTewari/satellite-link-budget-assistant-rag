These programs will be followed by a half hour of panel discussions, conversation with village viewers, and suggestions for future programs. The audio part of the programs will be presented in several native ILhguages and English simultaneously. The other part of this activity will br ng elevision and radio programs to Alaska ,at the time they are broadcast in the c6ntiguous'48 states.

While the telemedicine experiment will build on the work begun in Alaska with ATS-1, the second objective--health education--involves a consortium of four 13-101 states: Washington, Alaska; Montana, and Idaho. t Only Washingtonpresently has a medical school. 13.4.5.5.1 Telemedicine The experiment in telemedicine will be. conducted3 at five"}
