These parameters are described mathematically inANSI (1983). Disengagement Time The counting ofDisengagement Time for theACTS LBR system starts when users signal their earth station that:they wish todisengage the call. The user's earth station then issues aCircuit Disconnect message totheMCSvia theinbound order wire. TheMCSinturnissues aDisconnect Acknowledgment to theearth stations viatheoutbound order wire. Thecounting ofDisengagement Time ends when theusers issue another access request,Ifthere are manv 5b1989010985-065 circuit requests, theMCSmaynot issue anewBTPuntil alltherequests are processed; thus, Disengagement Time mayvary with thenetwork traffic load, the number ofconnection/disengagement requests, andnumber ofterminals requiring FECcoding. Disengagement Time isasignificant performance parameter relating totheACTS LBRsystem performance. Therefore, itisincluded inthesetof ACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. Disengagement Denial Probability Disengagement denial for the ACTS LBRsystem could occur due to transmission bit errors during aCircuit Disconnect request orDisconnect Acknowledgment. IftheMCS receives aninvalid Circuit Disconnect request, i.e., thecircuit identified intherequest isnotontheactive circuit list, therequest isignored. Theearth station issuing therequest will repeat the disengagement request ifitdoes notreceive aDisconnect Acknowledgment within aspecified time. During deep fades, several Circuit Disconnect requests could beissued before theMCS acknowledges. Thus, there isthepossibility that a Disengagement Denial would bedeclared due toexcessive request pro_essing delay. Because theACTS LBR system uses CRCs ontheorder wire commands andFEC coding during fades, Disengagement Denial Probability would beinsignificant. Therefore, Disengagement Denial Probability isnot included inthe set of ACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.4 Ancillary Parameters Because these parameters rely entirely ontheuser, they arenotincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. This isnot toimply that they areunimportant. Anestimate oftheir impact onsystem performance isuseful for identifying performance problems and developing methods to improve the systems ease ofuse. The following discussion identifies and roughly estimates some oftheuser's influence onsystem performance forthe four ancillary performance parameters.
