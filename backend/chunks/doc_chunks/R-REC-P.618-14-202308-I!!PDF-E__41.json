At frequencies above 10 GHz, the ionospheric time delay (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) is generally smaller than that for the troposphere, but may have to be considered in special cases. Range determination to centimetre accuracy requires careful consideration of the various contributions to excess range delay. The water vapour component amounts to 10 cm for a zenith path and a reference atmosphere with surface water vapour concentration o f 7.5 g/m3 and 2 km scale height Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 27 (see Recommendation ITU -R P.676). This contribution is the largest source of uncertainty, even though the dry atmosphere adds 2.3 m of the zenithal excess range delay. For current satellite telecommunication applications, additional propagation delays contributed by precipitation are sufficiently small to be ignored. 6 Bandwidth limitations In the vicinity of the absorption lines of atmospheric gases, anomalous dispersion produces small changes in the refractive index. However, these refractive index changes are small in the bands allocated to Earth -space communications, and will not restrict the bandwidth of systems. Multiple scattering in rain can limit the bandwidth of incoherent transmission systems due to variation in time delays of the multiple -scattered signals; however, the attenuation itself under such circumstances will present a far more serious problem. A st udy of the problem of bandwidth limitations imposed by the frequency dependence of attenuation and phase shift due to rain on coherent transmission systems showed that such bandwidth limitations are in excess of 3.5 GHz for all situations likely to be enco untered. These are greater than any bandwidth allocated for Earth -space communications below 40 GHz, and the rain attenuation will therefore be far more important than its frequency dependence. 7 Angle of arrival Elevation -angle errors due to refraction are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834.
