The parabolic collimator was rotated in opposition to the direction of spacecraft spin by a 128-step synchronous stepping motorand encoder controlled by the Mechanical Antenna Control Electronics, MACE. The MACE system was essentially identical tO the, PACE system employed on ATS-1. The measured in-orbit gain of this antenna was about 17 dB with a beamwidth of approximately 20. The PACE system displayed a capability of pointing the antenna beam towards the earth within about ±0.7 degrees. Antenna system reliability was, in general, quite good. During the satellite's first year in orbit, several malfunctions of the despinning mechanism were observed due to stalling of the stepping motor. No thermal effects could be related to this anomaly. It was hypothesized that a failure of the electric damper circuit associated with the stepping motor Regulator 13-20 No. 2 was responsible for the abnormal behavior. A switchover to backup electronics eliminated these malfunctions. -Prime objectives .ofthe microwave communications experim.ents-were -defined in Paragrdph 13.2. 1. The fifil obj,&itive, pr6vidfig support to 6ti6r, dnliokd experi­ ments, was readily accomplished -through numerous transmissions 'ofWideband data from othet satellite experiments. The spacecrat teldvisi6dcahn'ras were the chief beneficiaries of this hiodd of operation.. Multiple access experiments of-primary interest and their basic results are described in Table 13-14. (7)(14) Additionally, measurements of system noise power ratio and muliiplex channel linearity,, envelope delay, harmonic distortion, and frequency response were carried outiwi{h satisfactory results. The experiments indicated that CCIR and CCITT standards on communications transmission can be met with-this type of system. Frequency-control and-w-high-level-of-inherent frequency siability are necessary to eliminate mutual interference on the uplink and to allow accurate demodulation-to baseband of the SSB signal containing no reference carrier. Automatic level control is .ncessary to assure a proper balance of modu­ lation indexe for all signals accessing the satellite's PM"}
