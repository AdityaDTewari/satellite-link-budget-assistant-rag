This group of earth ter­ minals is provided with transmit carrier power monitoring equipment to control its own transmit signal power. Modifications to the AN/MSC-46 tracing receivers will permit tracking the biphase modulated beacon signal from the satellite. Four of these earth terminals will also receive the"}
