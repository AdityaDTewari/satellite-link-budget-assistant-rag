Historical Summary of Program Activities as of Mid-1974 The figure dramatically displays the very short duration of the Score and Courier programs conducted during the early history of satellite comniunibations. These pro­ grams represented the initial attempts'to employ active satellites for communications. During this early era, the Echo and West Ford programs also displayed the long life times attainable through employing passive satellites to establish a communications system. However, the Telstar, Relay, and Syncom programs soon proved that highly reliable active satellites were feasible and, in view of the higher system capacities provided, all subsequent programs have followed their lead. Some modest interest in passive satellite technology has been retained by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) but no technology developments or future satellite launchings are presently planned. The technology demonstrated in the Telstar, Relay and Syncom programs led, in a relatively short time, to the development of operational systems. Subsequent programs providing these systems have included Intelsat, Initial Defense Communi­ cations Satellite Program (IDCSP), Skynet, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) program, the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Phase. II, and Telesat programs. Additionally, a Canadian domestic satellite system is operational, and the U. S. domestic satellite systems, one leasing channels from the Canadian Satellite (Telesat or ANII9, are operational. Satellite experimentation has"}
