The technique is analogous conceptually to that of ray tracing. The wire-grid modeling technique(10' 11) is based on the premise that a solid conducting body may be substituted by a grid of thin wires con- figured to correspond to the geometry of the scatterer.. Using this grid the unknown currents excited by the incident field may be determined by a system of simultaneous equations. Satisfactory application of this tech- nique requires sufficiently short wire grid segments about 0.1 wavelengths. Once the currents on the grids are established, the corresponding reradiated fields can be calculated and then added to the primary field resulting in the total field of the antenna. 4-11 The technique using the magnetic field integral equation (12,13) is similar to that of the wire mesh. The advantages of this method are that it is theoretically more exact (neglecting mutual coupling), it imposes no restrictions on the materials of the medium, and it provides polarization insight because of its utilization of field vector formu- lation. Although use of this latter technique has shown that individual deviation between the theoretical and experimental pattern of an antenna obstructed by a spacecraft can differ by as much as 5 dB, on the average the agreement is considerably better. One particular advantage of the integral equation formulation is that it is sufficiently general with respect to the primary sources and consequently any source antenna may be used as an input to the analysis. In addition, once the matrix describing the scattering surface has been generated, it can be reused at relatively little additional expense in terms of computer utilization to determine the antenna location for an optimal combined radiation pattern. Clearly, studies of this form are bpyond the scope of this study."}
