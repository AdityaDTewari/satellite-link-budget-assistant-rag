This isbecause theabove equation implicity assumes that rainfall ishomogeneous over the propagation path, which isusually nottrue. Byassuming asimple Gaussian model fortherain rate with•distance along thepath, Hodge (1977) derived an expression forattenuation ratio that includes aninhomogeneitycorrection factor, anduses thehigh correlation between attenuation andpeak rain rate toeliminate therain rate: A2a2/A1v_./ b2/b_-I _'1=a,_a, / Thisyields abetter fittoempirical data. 6.3.4.4 Elevation AngleScalin9.Step5,theelevation angle scaling between theoperationalelevation angle Bopandthemeasured dataangle Bmeas issomewhat complex., sinceDisinversely proportiona) tocosB.The first order, thecosecant rule isrecommended, namely A(O2) csc02 sinOI =csceI=sine2i.\". ;T\" g. . )i_..:-:!.'.: . }-:.:::., iL?:i_;T •\".,. }::::.ii ,:.:\",,j. ,:..:.,• !L_,'....

Figure 6.3-10 shows anexample of applying thedistribution extension technique. Theupper twocurves are cumulative rain-rate andattenuation statistics derived from more than 600 total minutes ofmeasurements over theJuly through December 1974 period. The bottom curve inthefigure isthemeasured distribution ofrain rate forthe entire six-month period (265,000 minutes). Comparison ofthetworain rate distributions shows that they arevery similar inshape. This indicates that thevain rate measurements made during attenuation measurements area statistically significant sample ofthetotal rainfall, andthat using the distribution extension technique isvalid. Theextended attenuation distribution, constructed asdescribed inparagraph 6.3.4.2, isshown inthe figure. 6.3.5 Fading Duration System designersrecognize that atsome level ofrain rate Rmthe entire system margin will beutilized.Thecumulative rain rate statistics indicate thepercentage oftimetherain rate exceeds Rm.Inthis section, atechnique ispresented forestimating anupper bound ontheduration ofthe periods that therain rate exceeds agiven Rm.This isequivalent tothe duration offades exceeding thedepthcorresponding toRm.
