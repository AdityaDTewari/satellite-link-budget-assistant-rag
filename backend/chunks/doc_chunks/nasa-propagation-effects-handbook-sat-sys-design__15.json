However, thelarger drops tend todominate thespecific attenuation atthehigher rain rates ofmost concern forthesystem engineer, andsothis deviation tends nottobe reflected intheintegral over drop diameters utilized inspecific attenuation calculations. Joss, etal(1968) have found significant variations ofNDandA fordifferent types ofrainfall based ononeyear's measurements atLocarno, Switzerland. These results arepresented inTable 2.3-1; however, the. climatic regions where theJoss statistics apply havenotbeen determined. Therefore, itappears best toutilize theLaws andParsons results, realizing that incertain areas oftheU.S. andCanada they have notbeen verified.

These include: (1)optical systems requiring imaging orscattering light from raindrops, (2)replicating techniques where apermanent record ofeach drop size ismade such asthe flour method (Laws andParsons -1943), dyed filter paper (Marshall and Palmer -1948), sugar coated nylon orfoil impactors, (3)capacitive •techniques duetochanging dielectric constant, and(4)impact types of sensors (Rowland -1976). Todaytheimpact-type ofsensor(calledadisdrometerafter drop distribution meter), isthefavored technique. TheApplied Physics Laboratory hasdeveloped twostyles ofdisdrometer with decided advantages overthe commercially available Distromet Ltdunit. These three types have been described byRowland (1976) andtheir calibration hasbeen compared. A typical experimental result fortwodisdrometers measuring thesame rain event on9March 1975, isshown inFigure 2.3-2.
