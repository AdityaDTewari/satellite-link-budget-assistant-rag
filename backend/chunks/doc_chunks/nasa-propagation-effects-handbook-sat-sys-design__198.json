Therain margin istheincrease insystem transmission parameters (such aspower orgain) needed tooffsetthe attenuation caused byrain andother precipitation. Note that since precipitation also increases theeffective noisetemperature ondownlink paths, themargin should include this effect aswell. Ifthesystem employs diversity (particularly, butnotexclusively, space diversity),there isan 381 effective \"diversitygain\" which canbeobtained. This diversity gain canbe subtracted from therainmargin. Allofthese calculations aredescribed in detail inChapter 6ofthis Handbook. The(possibly adjusted) rain margins must beapplied ontheupanddownlinks inaccordance with theperformance suballocation decisions made intheprevious phase. Once again, this isbest il]ustrated through theexamples. Weaddress thedigital system example first. Wewill assume no measured attenuation orrain rate statistics areavailable, andwill usethe analytic estimation technique ofFigure 6.3-1 (theGlobal Model).

Forthis case, we calculate thehorizontal projection distance ofthepath tobe9.9km. The point rain rate exceeded inregion D3for0.5_ ofthetime is7.8mm/hr. The attenuation values exceeded forthis time arepredicted at2.9dBfor12GHz and4dBfor14GHz. Thecomposite C/Nforthecircuit canbeless than 9dB for1%ofthetime orless. Using anequal allocation philosophy, the carrier-to-noise ratio notexceeded oneither linkfor0.5% ofthetime should be12dB. With thecurrent initial parameter values, thedownlink clear air C/Nis13.7 dB. Therain attenuation expected would drop this tog.7dB,so •atleast 2.3dBofdownlink rainmargin isneeded. Inasimilar manner the required uplink margin isfound tobe1.2dB. Theuplink margin could easily beprovided byincreasing theground terminal transmitter power. Thedownlink margin canbegained either through anincrease insatellite EIRP orground station G/T. Rather than attempting toagain increase thesatellite EIRP, we shall exercise ouroption for5-meter ground station antennas, which provides 4.4dBmore gain. (Note that ground stations located indrier climates may meet theavailability requirements with 3-meter antennas.) Since agiven ground terminal"}
