The positional control of the satellite, the switching off of spaceborne apparatus, and the transmission of telemetric data from the satellite are done with the telemetric command system. Commands reach the satellite in an encoded form and are addressed to the corresponding activating mech­ anisms within the spacecraft. 11. 2. 1. 1 Communications Control All the operations required for reading the satellite's systems for a communica­ tions session (orientation of the antenna platforms, switching on the relay apparatus, control of the power-supply system, thermal regulation, etc.) are handled automati­ cally upon signals from a program-logic device. This device (computer) also deter­ mines the length of the communications session. The on-board device is fed with programs sent by command from the ground. When necessary, an operator on earth 11-6 - -SCHEDULE NO.PAGE -OF- TITLE Molniya-1 Communications Satellite Launches and Status CLASSIFICATION AS OF DATE I Unclassified January 1973 ITEM CY-651CY-661CY-67 CY- CI +6 CCY-71-r CY-72 CY-73 rMAJOR MILESTONES N. 12 2 13 2 2 144 L 2L 3t4 12 13 4 ...---. ... .
