ACTS will beavailable free ofcharge to private industry, universities, and local, state and Federal Government agencies forconducting experiments anddemonstrating the feasibility ofits advanced systems. ACTS isnot intended tobearevenue-generating communication satellite. Itsprimary purpose istodemonstrate newtechnologies and ideas that maybe incorporated inanoperational advanced satellite system. The final architecture andprotocols ofcommercia] systems maybevastly different from ACTS. However, ACTS will provide astarting point for designing such an advanced communication satellite systems. ACTS will basically operate asaswitched digital communication network. Assuch, itbecomes desirable toquantify its performance from theuser's perspective. This will provide abasis for evaluating how acommercial advanced communication satellite system performs from theuser's perspective andwill help identify theperformance impact ofthevarious ACTS technologies. The primary focus ofthis section istopresent astandard method for quantifying ACTS system performance. 371989010985-047 The section isdivided into three subsections. The first gives abrief system overview and operation description ofthe ACTS low burst rate (LBR) mode. Thesecond discusses howthe21ANSX3.102 performance parameters, introduced inSection 2,relate toperformance oftheACTS LBRmode. Andthe third discusses the basic design requirements for anACTS LBR system ! performance experiment using theframework ofANSX3.141. 4.1 ACTS Overview andOperation This subsection provides abrief introductory description of the ACTS LBRsystem and anoverview ofits operation. Inukai, etal. (1988), Naderi and Campanella (1988), and Wright (1986) offer additional in-depth information onthecapabilities andoperation ofACTS. 4I.i ACTS LBRSystem Overview . TheACTS LBR system isatrue DAMA digital communication network using a _ii. l-ms TDMA frame format. Thenetwork isastar topology with thesatellite as :_ thecentral switching hubandtheindividual earth stations astheends. Itis aconnection oriented. Theuser's data aresent inpacket-like segments with address and control fields, butsince there isonly one switching node, the packet path does notchange from packet topacket. The address andcontrol fields ofthepackets form an\"order wire,\" functioning like thecommon channel interoffice signaling systems used bylong-haul carriers. Through theorder wires, theuser's request service, in64kb/s increments, from 64kb/s upto approximately"}
