It includes the ability to deactivate carrier transmis­ sion to the satellite during periods of talker inactivity and a decentralized control concept allowing self-assignment of available satellite channels. The SPADE system has been assigned to transponder 10 of INTELSAT IV satellites. This particular transponder does not have access to the spot beam antennas. SPADE is compatible with standard manual or automatic international signaling and switching systems. User applications, where the satellite channel requirements vary widely over the period of a day, find SPADE quite attractive. Each of the INTELSAT IV transponders, in conjunction with the earth coverage satellite antennas and the fourth generation ground complex, provides about 600 fall duplex voice channels when FDMA-FM is employed, 800 full duplex voice channels when SPADE is used, or 1 FM color televi­ sion channel, including the TV audio. Planning for the INTELSAT IVA system is more complex than IV because of transmission constraints resulting from frequency reuse techniques. For IVA there are two possible up-link modes: hemispheric (East and West) and global. The down-link has three modes: hemispheric (East and West), spot (NW, NE, SW, and SE), and global. In order to provide such services as SPADE, TDMA, TV, and telephony to earth stations outside the normal hemispheric cbverage zones, four transponders have been designated as global beam channels in IVA. With some con­ straints, the remaining 8 co-transponder pairs (10 transponders) can be switched to either a hemispheric or spot beam on the down-link. That is, of the potential 1,000 MHz bandwidth mode available by frequency reuse techniques, 160 MHz (four 40 MHz transponders) will be lost in order to provide unique services on a global scale. Within these bounds, the 20-transponder INTELSAT IVA is"}
