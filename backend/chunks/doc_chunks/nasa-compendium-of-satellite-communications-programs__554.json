Among these is the successful devel­ opment of thin-wall Ilver waivegtuide filters, providing a large reduction in1weight without degratation inl performance.LOCX The repeater is an all-microwave, fixed gain, 12 chamnl design whore each channel is essentially an independant amplifier with a bandwvidth of 36 Main. The only active equipment common to all channels is a wideband receiver which establishes the system noise temperature, translates the 60GHz carriers to 4GHz, and ampli­ fies the 4 G0hz carriers to an intermediate power level prier to Ihnalhzation. Separation into channels is accompfised by two nmultiplexers for the even and odd numbered channels, each of which consists of a hank of six circulator-coupled waveguide filters. A high efficemncy TWT amplifier with a saturated output power of 5 watts is provided is each channel for final power amplifiation. After power amplification, the channels are summed by two low loss multiplexers, again odd and even, each of which consists of a bank of six waveguide filers. Receiver re­ dundancy is provided, and two spare channels are available since the satellhte is sized for ton channel operation at the end of the 7 year mission life. Figure 18-7.
