As can be seen from the curve a minimum value of zero exists for user antenna beamwidths less than 570, and increases to 76% at 9 = 1000. Maximum visibility time increases rapidly from 48% for a 300 beam to a constant upper bound of 85% at 0 = 400. The upper bound is the same for all beamwidths since for Case 2 it is required that r * LT> 0, i.e., : (r, L) < 900. Figure 3.7 describes the maximum visibility times for a user orbital 0inclination of 99 .As with Case 1 the minimum communication time is zero for all beamwidths considered. The maximum remains constant at 46% for beamwidths less than about 55%. At this point, the curve rises sharply to 87% for 0 t 700. This seemingly strange behavior can be explained by noting that for small beamwidhts only one TDRS at a time can fall near enough to the orbit plane of the user for communications to be possible. Thus, the lower level of the maximum visibility curve (46%) represents communications with just one TDRS. When the beamwidth is sufficiently large"}
