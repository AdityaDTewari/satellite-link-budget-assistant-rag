Furthermore, these rain cells donotoccur immediately adjacent tooneanother. Thus, onemight expect that the probability ofsimultaneous fading ontwopaths tospatially separated earth terminals would belessthan that associated with either individual path. This hypothesis wastested first byWilson (1970) using radiometric noise emission measurements todetermine therain attenuation onseparated paths and byHodge (1974a) using actual earth-space paths. These andother ensuing experiments have clearly demonstrated that path diversity isaneffective technique forimproving system reliability inthepresence ofrain attenuation. Atypical path diversity earth terminal configuration isshown in Figure 6.5-1 along with thedefinitions which will beused inthelater discussions. Theparameters aredefined asfollows: AZ=azimuth ofearth-space path (degrees) EL=elevation ofearth-space path (degrees) d'=separation between earth terminals (km) B'=orientation ofearth terminal baseline (degrees 0sB<180) =major axis ofpredominant rain cell orientation (degrees 0s¢<180) 6.5.1.2 OtherDiversitYConcepts. Sixalternative approaches (Brandinger-lg78 andEngelbrecht-1979) have also been suggestedastechniques forimproving reliability inthepresence ofrain attenuation. Thefirst, angle diversity, uses oneground sitewith more than oneearth-space path to satellites located inseparated orbitalpositions; thus, thepaths are orientedalong different azimuths. Ifarain cell islocated ononepath at some distance from theterminal, theresult will bequite similar tothat for path diversity; however, ifarain cell islocated near theterminal, little improvement results. This approach isnotaseffective aspath diversity but mayfind utilityincases where multiple satellites areavailable. Thesecondapproach, frequency diversity,isbased onthefrequency dependence ofrainfall attenuation. Inthis case channel assignments both 255 \\ l RAINCELLORIENTATION \\1 I I Figure 6.5-1.
