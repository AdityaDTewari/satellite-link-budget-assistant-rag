Satellite-to-Satellite Experiment Confi.guration(4 2) The GEOS-C will be equipped with a-radar altimeter, cubed-corner reflectors used for LASER tracking, a doppler transponder, and C-Band radar transponders. Consequently, the orbit of this spacecraft can be determined -with high precision for geodetic purposes. (42) To accomplish the second objective, that of developing the technology and demon­ strating the feasibility of a data relay system, data from Nimbus will be relayed via ATS-6. The data transmission capacity of the Nimbus to ATS-6 link is determined by the power of the transmitter and antenna gain available on the Nimbus spacecraft; this capacity is more than sufficient to provide highly reliable transmissions of nor­ mal 4 kbps data from Nimbus to the ground via ATS-6. To perform a more meaning­ ful evaluation of T&DRE return link performance, test data will be transmitted at rates of 50, 100, 200, and 400 kbps. 'Signal detection at the ATS ground station will be done using a high-performance carrier tracking phase demodulator which will track the residual carrier component of the transmitted signal under all system doppler conditions.

Information gained from this experiment Will C ,- RFi. Information gained from the Radioprovide for more' effective' use and regulation of Frequency Interference experiments will enable more effective use and regulation of radio radio transmissions. -It will thus aid the develop- transmissions. The experiment will measure the mutual interference between satellite and ment and implementation of advanced spacecraft terrestrial"}
