A Typical Thin Route Station -Block Diagram stations, but in a modular fashion such that any one or a group of subsystems could be .transported to any location desiring service. For example, in addition to having a complete television station, should television transmission be required from an existing fixed. station not presently equipped for this function, a complete television transmission up-chain consisting essentially of modulator, up-converter and high power amplifier could be air shipped together with the necessary interconnection items and quickly in­ stalled in the existing building. The provision of message service is covered by a small facility configured to trdnsmit and receive two voice channels. These two stations are to be operational by mid-1974. The transportable television station has as basic requirements, the ability to be road transported and the ability to provide two simultaneous television transmissions with associated audio. The transmission quality from this station is less than the highest quality available in the Telesat system. It can be set up and made ready for service within .two working days with a technical crew of two to set up and operate the communications facilities, howecer, additional support is required during antenna erection and dismantling. The television station is comprised of the following equip­ ment: 1. A 9.8-meter (32-foot) diameter focal fed antennawhich has been designed for ease of erection on a variety.of locations. When dismantled, the antenna is assembled in a configuration which"}
