In addition, there were three component failures, none of which affected system operation; one of the four earth sensors behaved erratically, one of the redundant de­ coders of the TT and C subsystem produced extraneous outputs at times,jand one SHF TWT suffered a reduced power level, probably due to helix current changes caused by temperature sensitivity. The UHF terminals developed for the TACSATCOM program were considered as advanced development models, while the SHF terminals were considered as feasibility models. Basically, the terminals met most of the electrical and mechanical require­ ments. The UHF equipment was fairly reliable, but the reliability of the SHF terminals and the TATS modem designed for TACSATCOM use were not as high as desired. 14-22 CITED REFERENCES 1. Statement of Maj.
