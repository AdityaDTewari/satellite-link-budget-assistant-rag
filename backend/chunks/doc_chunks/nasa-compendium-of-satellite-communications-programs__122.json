Major characteristics of the predominant participating terminals are described in Table 6-7 (17-26) For communication purposes, circular polarization, corresponding to that of the satellite, was employed at all terminals. This choice avoids the difficulties that Faraday rotation in the ionosphere could present. All of the terminal designs reflect an intense prevailing interest in reducing receive system noise to the very minimum and accurately tracking a moving satellite. The Andover terminal included three separate tracking antennas with their individual associated autotrack systems in addition to a 6apability for computer­ derived programmed tracking. The autotracking systems were all, broadly speaking, of the monopulse type. Major subsystems of the Andover terminal are shown in the block diagrarm of Figure 6-2.
