In addition to the factors indicated in the table, structural blockage during maneuvers was found to be an occasional problem in aircraft and shipboard terminals. Performance of the three major types of modems evaluated in the tactical satellite communications environment is summarized in Table 9-20 In all cases, the table indicates performance on a channel perturbed by additive white Gaussian noise alone. 9-43 Table 9-18, Noise and Interference to UHF Tactical Satellite Communications Test Nature of Results 1. Vehicular Terminal Receive System Noise Receiver noise temperatures varied between 3600 K and 5300K. Contribu- Temperature tions by environment were as low as 3000 K and occasionally an order of magnitude higher. Total system noise temperatures ranged between about 7000K and 3,7000K. RFI was an occasional problem. Both AN/TRC-24 and'AN/ARC-27 terminals were sources of interference. 2. Shipborne Terminal Receive System Noise Total receive system noise temperatures varied between about 6000K Temperature and 2000K. RFl was not a serious problem but was occasionally encountered. Shipboard radars such as the AN/SPQ-5A, AN/SPS-29, and AN/SPS-43; communications terminals such as'the AN/GRC-27, pbrtable electri6 generators and ar6 welders could produce interference. 3. Airborne Terminal Receive System Noise Total receive system noise temperature including RFI was about 1000 K Temperature over water and lightly populated areas, about 2000 0K over fairly heavily populated land areas, and abouf 10, 000 K at low altitudes directly over industrialized t6wns. Specific high. power UHF ground communications tiansmitters and the Time Division Data Link (TDDL) transmitters, located around the perimeter of the U. S. caused interference problems. 4. Uplink Interference to Synchronous Satellites Measured on, LES-5 and LES-6. * Largest signalscome from TDDL sites- in the ait-defense system. Many other signals also detected. There was no piling-up"}
