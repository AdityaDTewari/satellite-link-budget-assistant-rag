Themacroscopic characteristics include items such asthesize, distribution andmovements of rain cells, theheight ofmelting layers andthepresence oficecrystals. Themicroscopic characteristics include thesize distribution, density and oblateness ofboth •rain drops andicecrystals. Thecombined effect ofthe characteristics onboth scales leads tothecumulative distribution of attenuation anddepolarization versus time, theduration offades and depolarization periods, andthespecific attenuation/depolarization versus frequency. Inthis chapter, wediscuss howthecharacteristics aredescribed andmeasured, andhowthemicroscopic andmacroscopic aspects are statistically related toeach other. Wealso describe howonemajor propagation effect, specific attenuation, canbeestimated. This informationp will serve asbackground fortherain andattenuation models ofthenext chapter. ° Precedingpageblank 2.2 2.2.1TYPESANDSPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONSOFRAIN Stratiform Rain Inthemidlatituderegions, stratiformrainfall isthetype ofrain which typically showsstratified horizontal extents ofhundreds ofkilometers, durations exceeding onehour andrainrates less•than about 25mm/h (1inch/h). This rain type usually occurs during thespringandfallmonths andresults, because ofthecooler temperatures, invertical heights of4to6km. For communications applications, these stratiformrains represent arain rate which occursforasufficiently long period that thelinkmargin maybe required toexceed theattenuation associated with aone-inch perhour rain rate. Asshownbelow, this ismuch easier todoatfrequencies below the22 GHzwater absorption line, than forfrequencies above theH20line. 2.2.2 Convective Rain Convective rains arise because ofvertical atmospheric motions resulting invertical transport andmixing. Theconvective flow occursina cell whose horizontal extent isusuallyseveralkilometers. Thecell usually extends toheights greater than theaverage freezing layer atagiven location because oftheconvective upwelling.Thecell maybeisolated orembedded in athunderstorm region associated with apassing weather front. Because ofthe motion ofthefront andtheslidingmotion ofthecell along thefront, the high rain rate durationisusuallyonlyseveralminutes, These rains arethe most common sourceofhigh rain rates intheU.S. andCanada. 2.2.3 C_clonicStorm Tropicalcyclonicstorms(hurricanes)sometimepassovertheeastern seaboard during theAugust-October time period.These circular storms are typically 50to200kmindiameter, move at]0-20kilometers perhour, extend tomelting layer heights upto8I_andhave high (greater than 25ram/h) rain rates..!.•L _i,___ ... _. i.-.¸•.¸ _ :U..\"- •.\" ,L-•. i-_-_ 2.2.4 Long-TermDistributions Thestratiform andcyclonic rain types cover large geographic locations andsothespatial distribution oftotal rainfall from oneofthese storms isexpected tobeuniform.
