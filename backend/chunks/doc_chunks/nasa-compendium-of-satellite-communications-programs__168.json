When the rocket motor failed to separate, spin axis conversion immediately started to occur. Before it was completed, .a few initial commun ications tests were conducted. The X-band repeater and antenna switching system functioned properly but the tumbling mode that was as­ sumed destroyed LES-I's usefulness. LES-2 was successfully launched along with the Lincoln Calibration Sphere (LCS)-1 later in 1965. This satellite was almost identical to LES-i. With the benefit of a revision of the satellite's ordnance circuitry, it was placed into the type of orbit that had been plannedLfor LES-1. Numerous communications experiments were conducted with this satellite and all objectives listed in Table 9-1, with the exception of Item 5, were accomplished. The satellite contained no experiment measuring the space radiation environment. LES-4 was launched along with LES-3, Oscar 4, and OV2-3 as a secondary payload aboard the third flight test of the Titan HIC. LES-3 was a UHF Lincoln Experimental Satellite operating as a radio signal generator. Oscar 4 was an amateur radio communications satellite for use by \"Hams\" throughout the world. OV2-3 was a scientific satellite to gather data on solar and geomagnetic activity by measuring changes in cosmic ray and trapped particle fluxes. The objective was to place LES-3 and LES-4 into near synchronous (i.e., 33,706 kilometers (18,200 nautical miles)), cir­ cular orbits having a 0° inclination. After a near perfect injection into parking and transfer orbits, the Titan HI C third stage failed to ignite and LES-3 and LES-4 were ejected into highly elliptical inclined orbits. 9-3 Table 9-2.
