Determinations were made by observing the flashes of sunlight reflected from the three mirrors mounted on the satellite's surface. 6.5 EXPERIMENTS The experiments conducted on the .Telstar project can be grouped into four: major categories as displayed and defined in Table 6-8. The radiation experiments, described in the table, contributed considerable data towards characterizing the particles within the inner and outer Van Allen-belts, Additionally, valuable knowledge of the effects of radiation upon solid-state devices (i. e., upon solar cells and transistors) was gained. The most spectacular radiation experiment result, however, was the discovery, from the data on Telstar I, that-high altitude huclear testing dramatically intensified the radiation environment in the Van Allen belts. (2)(27) The space experiments, defined in Table 6-8, monitored such items as attitude of the spacecraft spin axis in inertial space, spin rate, temperatures at the spacecraft surface and' of critical, internal components, satellite RF power levels, and variations in spacecraft circuitry and components. Changes in spin axis attitude, due to the residual magnetic moment of the spacecraft, were recorded. Spin rate decay, resulting from eddy currents generated in the satellite as it rotates in the earth's magnetic field, was observed. The decay was greater on Telstar I because of its lower orbit. Skin temperatures varied between about 2470 K (-150 F) and 2780 K (400 F). 6-10 Table 6-8. Summary of Program Activities t Type Program Activity Objective Nature of Activity Satisfied , 1.
