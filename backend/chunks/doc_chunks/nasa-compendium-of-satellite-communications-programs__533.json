A single modem will be installed in non-nodal terminals. New PSK modulation equipment will be used in Stage lb to support the wideband digital and imagery traffic requirements in a PSK/FDMA mode of operation. This new PSK modulation equipment will allow a more efficient use of the satellite's RF band­ width than do the present MFSK modems. These modems will be capable of operating at a number of data rates from 19.2 kbps to 1.8 Mbps. Stage lb protected traffic will be provided on a terminal-to-terminal basis using existing AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. As in Stage la, dedicated links will be provided between selected users and will pass low data rate hardcore traffic 17-23 only. It will be necessary to locate multiple PN equipment at a node if more than one protected link is to be established between the node and other terminals. The capacity on these links will be commensurate with the capabilities of the present AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 equipment and the satellite power split with the analog traffic. Stage Ic begins with the introduction of the PCM, TDM, and PSK modulation equipment on the first Phase H satellite communication link. No further modifications to the Phase I terminals beyond those made in Stages la and lb are considered nec­ essary to accommodate this new future equipment. Since this new digital equipment will be phased into the Phase II DSCS over an extended period of time, the initial period of Stage ic will be a hybrid operation; i. e. , a mixture of analog and digital operation on separate RF carriers. The extent of this period will depend on the availability of the equipment and the necessary procurement of funds. To improve the efficiency of the digital transmissions"}
