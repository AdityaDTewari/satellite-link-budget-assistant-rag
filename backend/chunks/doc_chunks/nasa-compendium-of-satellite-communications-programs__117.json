Specific objectives were as indicated in Table 6-1. Table 6-1. Telstar Program Objectives Number Description 1 Demonstrate broadband transmission through communication satellites. 2 Test operational communications satellite reliabilities. 3 Obtain operational experience with satellite ground terminals. 4 Increase knowledge of satellite tracking techniques. 5 Provide scientific measurements of radiation in space. Two active spacecraft, Telstar I and Telstar H,-were successfully launched into medium altitude elliptical orbits during the course of the program as indicated by Table 6-2. (1)(2) Numerous communication demonstrations and detailed experiments were successfully conducted with Telstar I during its 7-month lifetime and considerable data on radiation Jn the.inner Van Allen-belt obtained. Before Telstar I finally failed from higher than expected radiation (which had resulted from the high altitude nuclear tests), an initial malfunction of the command circuit was successfully diagnosed from the ground and the satellite was commanded back \"on.\" This ground diagnosis represented a first in satellite communications. Program 6-1 objectives were for the most part met in the Telstar I experiments. Telstar II, launched after the failure of Telstar I, extended the previous experiments and demonstrations. Table 6-2.
