(41) 13.4.3.1 Antennas- The antennas used with the communications system are located in two areas: (1) the prime focus feed, on the top surface of the EVM, which illuminates the 9­ meter (30-foot) parabolic reflector, and (2) the earth viewing horns on the bottom sur­ face of the EVM that receive and transmit signals directly to and from the earth. Figure 13-16 shows the antenna layout on the top surface. Figure 13-17 shows the bottom view of the subsystem. The antennas connected with the Radio Beacon and interferometer experiments are not shown, on 'Figure 13-17. The composite feed assembly shown in Figure 13-16 is used in conjunction with the reflector to provide efficient antenna performance over a broad range of fre­ quencies and a wide variety of beam shapes, sizes, and functions. Although individual feed elements are used for each frequency band to permit optimum performance, a great deal of commonality exists among the radiating elements. To satisfy polariza­ tion, weight, and size requiremeits, cavity-backed cross-dipole elements are used for S, L, and UHF feeds. These elements offer simple and reliable radiators capable of operating at the frequency bandwidths, and polarizations defined-by the experi­ ments. With the exception of VHF radiators, the feed layout enables placement of all radiating elements in the parabola's focal plane, and minimizes interaction between neighboring feeds. 13.4.3.2 Physical Description The components that comprise the communications subsystem are located in the uppermost section of the EVM.
