Figure 15-6 ( 4) is a simplified diagram of the essentials of the communications chain. The low noise receiver is preceded by a \"waffle-iron\" type low pass filter giving 93 dB of protection against the transmitter signal spaced only 500 MHz away. The duplicated transmitter subsystem is designed to provide accurate control of power output from 100 W to 20 kW, with control of power shared between the FM and PN paths. Channel combining is performed at SHF to avoid the risk of FM and pseudo­ -noise intermodulation that could arise with a common upconverter stage. The operational requirements of frequency flexibility and high stability are met by deriving the local oscillator signals from frequency synthesizers in the 100­ to 150-MHz band, which are locked to a high stability (1 part in 10 0)master oscil­ lator at 1 MHz. The Type I and Type IUstations have a duplicated master oscillator and one spare synthesizer (as a compromise between full redundancy and economy) for the three operational local oscillator sources (receive, PN, and FM transmit). 15.4.2 Type III and IV Earth Terminals The SKYNET Types I and IV earth terminals"}
