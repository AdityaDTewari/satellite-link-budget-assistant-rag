A iflly Variable, demand-access, SPAD-'s~tem was -demonstrated for the first time when the INTELSAT IV satellites were placed into operational service. As-implied SPADE is'a demand assignment muiltiple access system. The de­ mand assignment feature is an effective method for increasing network capacity, and telephone companies have used the concept for many years. Thus, 800 satellite channels can be made to service from 2400 to 3200 individual user trunks on a de­ mand basis. The key to this capability -ofallowing earth stations to operate on the carrier to.provide the required channel to two user trunks, is a SPADE channel unit frequency synthesizer. This module is capable of generating any one of 800 carrier frequencies (at IF) on command from a computer or other remote calling source. Thus, when a call is being established, the channel unit is instructed to operate on the allocated frequency. The digitized voice then modulates (quadraphase PSK) that carrier and is translated to 6 GHz together with all other operating channel unit out­ puts. 10-12 With the SPADE operation voice channels are carried at 64 kbps with a bit error . rate of 1 x 10-4This rate is unacceptable for wideband digital data. For data, there­ fore, forward-acting error coders are used to enhance that channel performance. 48 or 50 kbps data is passed through a rate 3/4 convolutional encoder, and the net data rate is then SPADE compatible at 64 or 66. 7 kbps. The resulting bit error rate is - better than 1 x 108 at the 48/50 kbps"}
