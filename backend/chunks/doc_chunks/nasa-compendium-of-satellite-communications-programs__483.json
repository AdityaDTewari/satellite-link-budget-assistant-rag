Table 15-5 (5)( 6)(9)gives the FM performance characteristics of the demodulators used by the mobile and shipborne terminals. Since communications reliability is of paramount importance, adequate link margins were allowed for unpredictable losses due to weather, misalignments and equipment degradation. Estimates of 2 dB for excess path attenuation and lO0 K for excess noise were used for earth stations in the U. K. and Singapore which are served by a suitably placed geostationary satellite. Losses were greater for an earth station with a radome because of the attenuation of a water film on the surface. Re' ductions in signal/noise ratios of up to 6 dB have been observed witha radome under wet conditions. Margins for both \"up\" and \"down\" links had to be allowed if a local rain squall were not to upset the power balance of the entire system.. 15.2.1 Control Subsystem. The SKYNET System exercises control of the spacecraft, the earth station com­ plex, and the traffic. Accurate control of the spacecraft is essential for successful 15-6 NOTE: ALL STATIONS CAPABLE OF COMMUNICATION WITH ONE ANOTHER Figure 15-1. SKYNET PN/SSMA Links Table 15-4.
