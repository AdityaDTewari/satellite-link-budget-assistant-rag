For PLACE, a special multiple access capability is provided for simultaneous C-band to L-band and iL-band to C-band operation. The receiver linearity is such that received multiple carriers do not produce significant intermodulation components. The received multiple carriers are translated to baseband and then phase modulated. onto a single carrier. Baseband information bandwidth is 1.5 kHz to 1.5 MHz. Auto­ matic gain control maintains the phase modulation at a 0. 85-radian rms independent of the number of carriers. In performing the data relay experiment, simultaneous S-band to C-band and C-band to S-band operation is provided. Also the C-band to S-band signal can be repeated on C-band. (41) Signals for the satellite instructional television experiment are received at C-band and simultaneously transmitted on UHF and C-band. The UHF transmission is for the primary experimental use while"}
