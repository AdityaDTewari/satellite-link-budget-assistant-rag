Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is used to access the sat- O ellite. Initially, the carriers are on pre-assigned frequencies; however, demand assignment techniques and voice activation may ultimately be used to increase system flexibility and capacity. As an alternative to telephone message service, these stations are capable of data transmission at 2400 bps, and in addition, they have the capability of expansion to provide for television receive and radio program transmit and receive. A photograph of a typical Thin Route station is shown in Figure 18-21. Fig­ ure 18-22 shows a block diagram of a Thin Route station with television and radio program features that could be added at a later date shown in dashed lines. 18.5 TRANSPORTABLE EARTH STATION FACILITIES Transportable earth station equipments have been acquired for television trans­ mission and message communications in order to increase the flexibility in the provi­ sion of communications services. The facilities have been designed as two complete 18-37 Figure 18-19.
