The impact of the spinning spacecraft upon the original experiment objectives was that: a) all satellite loop tests had to be performed using a sampling technique that was synchronized to the spacecraft spin rate; b) the earth station AGC time constant had to be small compared to variations in the received signal to allow maximization of the sample time; c) fading at rates.greater than about one half the sampling rate, but not as great as those that could be observed in one sampling interval, were impossible to record; and d) FDM two-way voice or multiple access voice demonstrations could not be completed. The tests were completed and their results are summarized in Table 13-28. (32) The results indicated that accurate navigation and high quality communications are feasible at L-Band. However, more data may be required to allow refined system designs. 13. 3. 6 Operational Results ATS-2, 4, and 5 were experimental satellites, therefore, no operational traffic was carried. Operation of C-Band, L-Band and millimeter wave terminals was quite satisfactory. Spacecraft operation, in the case of ATS-4, was very limited and all equipment appeared to be performing well. On ATS-2 and 5, however, operations were more extensive and some anomalies were encountered. The anomalies on ATS-2 included a missing and a broken stabilization boom, unplanned environmental measurements package turnoffs, inadvertent gravity gradient regulator turnoffs, and an inability tb retract gravity gradient booms. The missing and broken booms were the result of the whipping action produced by spacecraft tumbling. The equipment turnoffs were determined to be due to low battery voltage caused by poor spacecraft aspect angle relative to the"}
