Estimates (CCIR-1978,Rpt.564-1) indicatethat theshort-term variations intheangle-of-arrival maybeoftheorder of0.02 degrees (0.37 milliradians) at1degreeelevation. This ishigher than thetheory predicts (see Figure 6.6-12), buttheeffect doesdecrease rapidly with increasing elevation angle. Crane (1976) reports values ofoBwithin thebounds of Figure6.6-12for 7GHzmeasurements made atvarying elevation angles with a 37mdiameter antenna. Generally, forbeamwidths greater than 0.01 degree andelevation angles above 10degrees,theangle-of-arrival fluctuations aremasked byother fluctuations. 6.6.5Fadin9andGain DegradationDesign Information 6.6.5.1 Fade Distribution Function Estimation.Theestimates ofgain reduction andsignal variance parameters, RandS2,have been presented.

Thefade distributionfor turbulence-induced fluctuations isassumed tobelog-normal, with mean and median being equal. Thefade distributions resulting from theOhio State University ATS-6 30GHzbeacon measurements (Devasirvatham andHodge-1977) indicate that this log-normal assumption isvalid forelevation angles above approximately 2°.Asimilar observation wasmade concerning the7.3GHzfade distribution above 4oelevation angle observedbyMcCormick andMaynard (1972).
