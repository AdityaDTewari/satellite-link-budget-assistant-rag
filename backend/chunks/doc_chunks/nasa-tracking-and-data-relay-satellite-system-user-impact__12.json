Several revolutions of the user's orbit are examined to determine the true maximum and minimum values of total visibility time. For convenience the results are expressed in terms of a percentage of the orbital period. 3-1 Spacecraft / / Rte Earth r TDRS - User Orbit Figure 3.1. Maximum User Antenna Gimbal Angle o 3-2 3.2 Mathematical Model(4) The approach taken is to determine the radius vector to the user as a function of time in an earth fixed coordinate system and to compare this vector with the constant radius vectors to each TDRS. By comparing these two vectors and rejecting the orbital period times when the earth intervenes between them, mutual visibility as defined above is determined. For a circular orbit the anomalistic mean motion n can be written as 2 3 R e 2n =no 1 ( 1 --sin2i) where n = Keplerian mean motion = e / a30 J2 = coefficient of first zonal harmonic of earth's potential R = earth's equatorial radiuse a = circular orbit radius i = orbital inclination P = earth's gravitational parameter Refering to Figure 3.2, at any time t the true anomaly v is simply V = n t, 3-3 Earth- /r User S/C11 Equator Greenwich Meridian Figure 3.2.

Thus, the radius vector i to the user spacecraft in the earth fixedsystem is described as r, a cos 0 cos r2 = a cos 0 sin A r3"}
