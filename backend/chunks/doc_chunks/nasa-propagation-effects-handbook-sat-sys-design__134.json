Incases where multiple measurements arereported, therange ofthe appropriate parameters isindicated. Afifth method, rapid response raingauges, hasbeen attempted, buthasnotbeen accurate forpredicting diversity gain. Thetworeasons cited (Allnutt-1978) are: 1)therainfall rate ontheground cannot beaccurately converted toarainfall rate onthe path, and2)therainfall-rate model giving thedrop-size distribution isnot accurate enough tocalculate theattentuation onthepath. 6.5.4 Path Diversity DesignFactors 6.5.4.1 Separation Distance. Diversity gain depends strongly upon theearth terminal separation distance, d'.Thediversity gain increases rapidly asd' isincreased over asmall separationdistance, i.e., uptoabout 10km; thereafter thegain increases more slowly until amaximum value isreached, usually between about 10and30km(Fig. 6,5-3). This maximum value is generally quite close tothat value associated with uncorrelated fading atthe individual earth terminals.i_iii_ _:.,•. ,f]: i. ,...\" •o Incontrast totheuncorrelatedcase, onemayargue that correlated fading mayoccur forpaths separated bydistances associated with typical rain cell separation distances. Such aneffect maybeinferred from therainfall statistics ofFreeny andGabbe (1969); however, these statistics are associated with point rainfall rates rather than path average rainfall rates. Again, nodefinitive report ofthis effect hasbeen published todate. 6.5.4.2 Baseline Orientation. Theperpendicular separation between parallel paths isgreatest when theearth terminals arelocated onabaseline perpendicular totheprojections ofthepaths ontheearth's surface. This arrangement minimizes thepossibility ofboth paths passing through thesame rain cell. Nevertheless, thedependence ofdiversity gain onbaseline orientation isquite weak except, possibly, forvery short separation distances. 262 4D 20 18 16 z.12 6 4 2 0 24681012141618202224 SITESEPARATION DISTANCE, d'(km) Figure6.5-3.
