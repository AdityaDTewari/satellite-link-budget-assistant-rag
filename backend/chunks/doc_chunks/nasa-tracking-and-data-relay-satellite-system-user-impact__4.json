INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) User Impact and Network Compatibility Study conducted by Hughes Aircraft Company, Space and Communications Group for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard Space Flight Center, under Contract NAS 5-20357. This study was to identify and examine antennas for the user spacecraft which satisfy TT & C data rates and have minimum impact on the user. The intended scope of the study also originally included considerations of compatibility with the NASA network ground stations and significant effort on antenna configurations which reject or protect from earth generated radio frequency interference (RFI).
