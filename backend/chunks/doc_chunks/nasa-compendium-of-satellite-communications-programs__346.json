Frequency-control and-w-high-level-of-inherent frequency siability are necessary to eliminate mutual interference on the uplink and to allow accurate demodulation-to baseband of the SSB signal containing no reference carrier. Automatic level control is .ncessary to assure a proper balance of modu­ lation indexe for all signals accessing the satellite's PM transmitter. Adequate short term frequency stability was found to be the most difficult requirement to meet but numerous special tests at NASA ground terminals indicated that much can be done to reduce instabilities. As expected, the higher receive antenna gain and EIRP of the ATS-3 satellite afforded greater performance capabilities thaafxleriegced with ATS-1. Experiments employing the spacecrafts' wideband frequency translation repeater measured Krequency division multiplex and television system performance. The frequency-divi.ion multiplex tests were conducted employing. a simulated loading of up to 1200 one-way voicd channels at RosniaA add up'to 24*0 6'e-way channels at Moj ave 'aht ,Cooby Creek.
