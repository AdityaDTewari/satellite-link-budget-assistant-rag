The feed assem­ bly consists of a three-horn aperture which accommodates both receive and transmit frequencies. The arrangement of the horns in the horizontal dimension assures that the antenna pattern, approximately 30 by 8 0 , is wider in that plane than in the perpendicular one. The shape of the pattern in the wide dimension is determined by the separation between the feed centers. The beam is pointed toward Canada about 7.60 off the equator. 18-7 Table 18-2.
