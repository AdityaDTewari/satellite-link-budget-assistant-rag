RESF-APX_'_ &TECb4N(_.Q(_Y INC produced byboth thetroposphere and ionosphere, sometimes termed signal fluctuation (orfast fading), arecaused byinhomogeneity intheindex of refraction along thepropagation path; under extreme conditions, this inhomogeneity may result ininternal atmospheric multipaths. The tropo- spheric effects areproduced inthelowest altitude region (first few kilometers) ofthepath bylocal features suchashigh humidity gradients and temperature inversion layers leading tosmall height intervals in which therefractiveindex profiledepartsmarkedly from theexpected generalexponential decrease with altitude. Toafirstapproximation, therefractive index structure ishorizontally stratifiedand theregions ofdepartureappear asthinhorizontal layers. Superimposed onthese layers, therefractive index ataparticular height will changeslightly inanoscillatory manner duetointernal waves and inarandom manner due toturbulence. The internal multipath effects producing fastfading are experiencedwhen rays propagate over aconsiderable distanceathighly oblique angles through thenear-horizontally-oriented smallerscale inhomogeneities. Though thisusually affects line-of-sight propagation more atlowelevation nngles[below 5°elevationatfrequencies below X-band), theamplitude fluctuations depend onwavelength andmay signi- ficantly affecthigher frequencies [above I0GHz) atincreasingly higher elevations. Theeffects are seasonally dependent andarevariable from day-to-day aswell asgeographically. 2.3.1 Ionospheric Scintillation Ionospheric inducedscintillation, also produced byinhomogeneity intheionospheric refractive index due toelectrondensity irregulari- ties,ismostly produced near theheight ofthemaximum electrondensity (F-region) oftheionosphere. Again, this may beexperienced atlow elevations where much oftheionosphere istraversedoratanyelevation when disturbed ionospheric conditions[suchasthosecl_ssedas\"spread-F\") areexperienced. There areparticular geographic regions where such conditionsprevail (e.g., equatorialregions orhigh latitudes where the propagation pathsintersect the auroralzones) andbecome significant in path selection and/ordesign.
