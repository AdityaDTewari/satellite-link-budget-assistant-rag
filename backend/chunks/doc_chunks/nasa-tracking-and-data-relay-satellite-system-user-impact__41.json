This type of antenna appears to lend itself well to stowage and deployment along its axis. Typical characteristics of a 2.25 GHz quadrifilar helix antenna are given in Table 4.8. Table 4.8 Quadrifilar Helix Antenna Characteristics Element length 233 cm Antenna diameter 26.6 cm Peak gain 3 dB Polarization Circular Beamwidth 130 degrees Weight 660 gm Materials Beryllium copper tubing (23) 4.3.7 Monofilar Helix Antenna The helical antenna has the advantage of being smaller in cross- section than other types of radiators with comparable gain and are less complex than dipoles and slot antennas. The axial mode helical radiator is formed by winding a wire in a helix with a pitch angle of from 11 to 16 degrees and a diameter of the order of X/3. A metallic ground plane whose dimensions are of the order of X is placed at one end of the helix. The helix is usually fed by a coaxial line whose outer conductor terminates on the ground plane and whose inner conductor passes through the ground plane to form the helix. The helix itself may be wound on a dielectric tube or supported by dielectric spokes extending from a tube along the longitudinal axis of the helix. 4-35 GROUND PLANE HELICES (PLATED) AND ON THIN FIBERGLASS TUBE Figure 4.14. Monofilar helix antenna 4-36 An example of a monofilar helical satellite antenna design is the Hughes HS-350 antenna, shown in Figure 4.14. This helix, used at S-band, achieves 13 dB gain, weighs 3.3 kg, and measures 30.5 cm long by 5.34 cm in diameter. 4.3.8 Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Antenna (24) The S-band antenna for the GMS consists of an array of cavity- backed slot radiating"}
