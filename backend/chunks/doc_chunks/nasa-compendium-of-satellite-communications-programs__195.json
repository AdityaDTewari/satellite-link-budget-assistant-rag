A functional block diagram of a'TATS flodem is givef inFigure This modem was specifically designed for the military tactical communica­ tions environment and 6ontinued to be used in extensive testing on TACSAT I (see Section 14.5). It was designed to allow a high level of random multiple 'access with a minimum of acquisition and synchronization difficulties, provide a high degree of resistance to RFI, and supply good performance in the face of multipath fading. As designed, it provided little resistance to jamming. Table'9-14. Signal Processing Using TATS, Multiple Access Code Division"}
