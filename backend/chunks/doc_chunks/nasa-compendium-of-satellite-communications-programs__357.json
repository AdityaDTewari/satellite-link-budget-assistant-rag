These categories are listed and defined in Table 13-18.(28), (29), (30) The objectives of the SHF C-Band experiments were the same as indicated in the \"General Descrip­ tion\" of the spin stabilized ATS (see Section 13.2.1). The objectives of the L-Band experiments were to demonstrate the feasibility of air-to-ground communications at these frequencies and to investigate propagation effects. The objective of the milli­ meter wave experiment was to investigate propagation at 15 and 32 GHz. Three active repeater satellites (i.e., ATS-2, ATS-4, and ATS'5) were launched during the ATS program for the express major purpose of evaluating gravity gradient stabilization. The status of these spacecraft is reviewed in Table 13-19. Table 13-18. Experiment Categories Number Description 1 Gravity-Gradient Stabilization at Medium and Synchronous Altitude 2 C-Band, L-Band, and Millimeter Wave Radio Communications and Propagation 3 Meteorological Experiments 4 Measurements of the Earth Environment 5 Technology Applicable to Spacecraft Stabilization and Stationkeeping 6 Miscellaneous Spacecraft Technology ATS-2 (i. e., ATS-A prior to launch) failed to reach its intended, 6000' nautical mile circular orbit when the second stage of the launch vehicle failed to restart leaving the spacecraft in a highly elliptical orbit having a relatively low perigee. This pre­ cluded proper testing of the gravity gradient control system although the stabilization booms were successfully deployed. Limited data was obtained on most of the 13-31 remaining spacecraft experiments including data on the C-Band communications, meteorological, and environment measurements experiment. Table 13-19.
