An automatic carrier balance capability provides automatic leveling of each transmitted carrier with an accuracy of *0.2 dB. The AN/MSC-60 terminal has been designed with extensive and sophis­ ticated automatic fault location, monitors and alarms. An interface has been provided for remoting the analog and digital signals relating to the many parameters that are monitored. 17-19 Figure 17-5.

However, the initial models procured will-be equipped with five transmit and nine receive converters. These terminals are designed to be deployed to nodal locations, replacing selected AN/MSC-46 terminals. The higher inherent availability of these terminals, together with their performance capability, will in­ crease the overall performance of Phase IL 17.4.4.2 AN/MSC-60, Medium Transportable (MT) The AN/MSC-60 (MI) was to be the medium-weight counterpart of the AN/MSC-60 heavy terminal. Both terminals are basically similar in electronic design and have"}
