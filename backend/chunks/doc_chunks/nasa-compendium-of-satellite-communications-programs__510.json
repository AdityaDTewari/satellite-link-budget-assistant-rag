A simplified diagram of the essentials of the communications chain is shown in Figure 16-5. 2. Phase III. Specifications for the ten additional Phase Ill earth terminals have not yet been released. The following design considerations apply to the Phase III earth terminals: * A major objective of Phase III terminal design will be to minimize future modifications. * Insofar as is possible, the new terminals should share the same sub­ systems as the Phase II modifications. This will increase cost ef­ fectiveness by reducing training, logistics, design and operational maintenance costs. * The transmitter and receiver should be fully capable of supporting a 40-megahertz PN link. * Both 13-(42-) and 6.1-meter (20-foot) terminals should be designed to employ subsystem redundancy wherever practical to achieve the high degree of availability required. * The receiver should be designed so that carriers anywhere in the satellite frequency band (7250 to 7750 MHz) can be received simul­ taneously. 16-19 Table 16-10.
