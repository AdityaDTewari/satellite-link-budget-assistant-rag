Strategic military communications were advanced when the DSCS Phase I satellites became operational in early 1974. Further advances will be realized in the future when the planned DSCS Phase I satellites are introduced. Developing tactical systems did not become a formally announced goal of the U. S. military until 1965 when the Tacsatcom program was established. The experi­ mental UHF satellites of the LES program and the Tacsat satellite followed in direct response to that goal. However, some of the major system concepts, and in particu­ lar the modulation concepts evaluated in these experiments, began to evolve in the West Ford program and the SHr portion of the LES program. The latter two evalua­ tions also contributed data of general scientific interest and information applicable to the development of strategic military systems but in a larger sense they represented the beginning of tactical military system experimentation. 1-10 NASA has been responsible for the purely scientific programs conducted to date. These programs have investigated technology applicable in all types of satellite communications systems. NASA became active in satellite communications at a very early date through the Echo passive satellite program. As the general interest in active satellites intensified in the early 1960s, the Relay and Syncom programs came into being to investigate these types of satellites in medium and synchronous altitude orbits, respectively. Towards the mid-1960s the questions on the type of satellite and orbit to employ had been resolved and approaches to realizing high gain satellite antennas, spacecraft stabilization, and multiple access became the vital issues. An Advanced Syncom program was initially conceived by NASA to study these problems. However, this soon evolved into the ATS program, which added a multitude of other space experiments to"}
