The core of the design is a central thrust tube to which are mounted the apogee motor and the forward and aft equipment platforms. The forward platform is thermally isolated from the rest of the structure to insure a stable surface for the antenna mounts while the aft platform contains the apogee motor nozzle and reaction control system. Surrounding the structural core are the north and south equipment platforms with jettisonable enclosures outside which provide the stow­ age for the extendible solar array. The east and west faces of the spacecraft carry the majority of the body mounted solar cells which provide housekeeping power until station acquisition and the deployment of the solar sails. The east and west faces also contain the spinning attitude sensors. Upon station acquisition the solar sails are deployed. They consist of 30 panels, 26 active and 4 blank, which are extended concertina fashion. Deployment is accom­ plished by means of a single 0. 02-cm (0. 007-in.) thick stainless steel Bi-Stem boom with 3.5 cm (1-3/8 in.) diameter and deployed length of 762 cm (300 in.) located on the shadowed side of each sail. 19.2.2 Thermal Subsystem Throughout the various phases of the CTS mission there will be a wide variation in the amount of heat dissipated by spacecraft components. This necessitates the use of protective devices such as super insulation blankets, jettisonable covers, radiator plates, second surface mirrors, thermal coatings, heat pipes, and heaters to insure the proper operation of spacecraft systems throughout the mission. All major heat dissipating components are mounted on the north-south panels which are covered with silvered quartz second surface"}
