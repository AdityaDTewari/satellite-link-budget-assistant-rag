ITU-R P.676 -13 13 Alternatively, β𝑖 can be calculated directly without calculating α𝑖 using Snell’s law in polar coordinates as follows: β𝑖=sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1 𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖sinβ1) (19b) and similarly, α𝑖 can be calculated as follows: α𝑖=sin−1(𝑛1𝑟1 𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1) (19c) In the Earth -to-space direction, equations (19a) or (19b) and (19c) may be invalid at initial apparent elevation angles < 1° (i.e. initial apparent zenith angle, β1,>89𝑜) when the radio refractivity gradient 𝑑𝑁/𝑑ℎ is less than −157 N-units/km, which may occur when radiosonde data from certain regions of the world susceptible to ducting are used as the atmospheric profile. In these cases, the radio wave is reflected by the atmosphere and follows the curvature of the Earth (i.e. travels in ducts) , and the argument of the inverse sine function in equations (19a) or (19b) and (19c) is greater than 1. Equations (19a), (19b), and (19c) are valid for all non -negative apparent elevation angles when any of the six reference standard atmospheres in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 are used as input, since these reference atmospheres do not have refractivity gradients characteristic of ducting. Figure 4 shows the zenith attenuation calculated at 1 GHz intervals for the mean annual global reference standard atmosphere in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 . The “Standard” atmosphere is the mean annual global reference atmosphere with ρ𝑜 = 7.5 g/m3, and the “Dry” atmosphere is the mean annual global reference atmosphere with ρ𝑜 = 0 g/m3. 2.2.2 Negative apparent elevation angles Equation (13) assumes the height increases between the earth station and space. However, for negative apparent elevation angles from an elevated earth station, the height decreases"}
