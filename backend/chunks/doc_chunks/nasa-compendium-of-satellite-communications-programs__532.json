Equipping two of these terminals with additional FM modems and an FDM multiplex to provide a limited capability during Stage la began prior to the first satellite launch. These modified terminals will be self-contained in that they will be provided with FM modems, FDM multiplex, and ancillary equipment to handle up to 12 voice channels. Operation of contingency terminals during Stage la will be via the satellite's NB-to-NB satellite communications channel. Protected traffic (i. e., antijam) will be provided during this stage on a terminal­ to-terminal basis using existing AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. This equipment will operate using PN/PSK/CDMA. These links will be dedicated between selected users. The protected traffic on these lines will be commensurate with the capabilities of the present AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 equipment. New FM modems will be provided for all Stage lb nodal terminals and all AN/ TSC-54 terminals. These modems will be capable of providing 3, 6, or 9 4-kHz analog circuits at a lower quality (e.g., TTNR = 33 dB) or 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 DSC quality (e. g., TTNR = 44 dB) 4-kHz analog circuits. Up to three modulators and up to seven demodulators will be installed at nodal terminals to provide service for the number of transmit and receive carriers required. A single modem will be installed in non-nodal terminals. New PSK modulation equipment will be used in Stage lb to support the wideband digital and imagery traffic requirements in a PSK/FDMA mode of operation. This new PSK modulation equipment will"}
