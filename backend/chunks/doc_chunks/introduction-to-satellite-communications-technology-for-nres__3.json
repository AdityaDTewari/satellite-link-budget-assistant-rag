This was developed and used extensively in Russia. Geosynchronous orbits are the most desirable and the most expensive to obtain. “Geosynch” satellites appear stationary to observers on the Earth. The orbit is always at the equator at a height of 23,400 miles; the satellite thus travels in the same direction and I Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN speed as the rotation of the Earth. These satellites, because they provide continuous coverage, are the workhorses of the commercial satellite industry. Geosynch satellites must be spaced at least 1/2 a degree apart to prevent signal interference. “Slots” are closely regulated by the International Telecommunications Union (T.C.U.). They are highly sought after and expensive to acquire, and since geosynch orbits are also expensive to launch and maintain, most satellites in this orbit are big and complex. Geosynchronous orbits require at least a quarter second round-trip time because of the 23,400-mile distance above the Earth plus the distance to the equator from the ground station. More power is also needed because of the distance (although a larger antenna on some satellites mitigates some of this). Since geosynch satellites are always in approximately the same place with regard to the Earth, it is possible to precisely map a “footprint” so that users can calibrate ground station equipment to minimize power and bandwidth. Geosynch satellites are kept tightly in their orbits by expending fuel. Older satellites are often let to drift north and south while keeping in their east-west slots. Satellites allowed to dnfi are said to be inclined orbits. This might require some tracking by ground equipment, but when the drift is large enough, it allows the satellites to be seen"}
