ITU-R P.676 -13 3 3 that, for values of surface temperature, surface pressure and surface water vapour density or integrated water vapour content statistics known from long -term historical data or from the maps in Recommendation ITU -R P.2145 , the approximate method in Annex 2 should be used to estimate statistics of the slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 350 GHz; 4 that, in the application of Recommendation ITU -R P.1853 , the method in Annex 2 should be used to estimate the Weibull approximation to the slant path water vapour attenuation. Annex 1 Line -by-line calculation of gaseous attenuation 1 Specific attenuation The specific attenuation at frequencies up to 1 000 GHz, due to dry air and water vapour, can be accurately evaluated at any value of pressure, temperature and humidity as a summation of the individual spectral lines from oxygen and water vapour, together with small additional factors for the non-resonant Debye spectrum of oxygen below 10 GHz, pressure -induced nitrogen attenuation"}
