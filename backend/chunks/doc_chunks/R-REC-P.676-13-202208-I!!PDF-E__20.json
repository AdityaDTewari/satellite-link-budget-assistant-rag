The downwelling space -to-Earth microwave brightness temperature looking up and the upwelling Earth -to-space microwave brightness temperature looking down can be calculated similar to equation (13). Layer 1 is typically at the surface of the Earth, and laye r k is at the top of the atmosphere (typically 100 km). The aggregate microwave brightness temperature is the sum of the microwave brightness temperatures of each atmospheric layer multiplied by the loss between t hat atmospheric layer and the observation point. It is assumed that the atmosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium and scattering is negligible. In the following paragraphs, 𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗) is the microwave brightness temperature of the jth layer defined by: 𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗)=0.048 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧[1 exp (0.048 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧 𝑇𝑗)−1] (K) (26) 18 Rec. ITU-R P.676 -13 where 𝑻𝒋 is the physical temperature of the jth layer. 𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗) can be well -approximated by 𝑇𝑗 for 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧 <0.42 𝑇𝑗; j is the specific attenuation (dB/km) of the jth layer given in equation (1), and 𝑎𝑗 is the path length (km) through the jth layer given in equation (17). The difference between the physical temperature, 𝑇, and the microwave brightness temperature of a blackbody source, 𝑇𝐵, is shown in Fig. 7. For a given frequency, 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧, 𝑇−𝑇𝐵→0.024 𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧 as the physical temperature, 𝑇, increases. 4.1 Downwelling microwave brightness temperature If the profiles of physical temperature, pressure and water vapour along the path are known, the downwelling microwave brightness temperature, which is the sum of: a) the cosmic microwave brightness temperature attenuated by the atmospheric attenuation and b) the downwelling atmospheric microwave brightness tempera ture, can be calculated as follows : 𝑇𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 =𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,2.73) 10−(∑ 𝑎𝑗𝛾𝑗k 𝑗=1 10) +∑ 𝑇𝐵(𝑓𝐺𝐻𝑧,𝑇𝑗)(10𝑎𝑗𝛾𝑗 10−1)10−(∑ 𝑎𝑖𝛾𝑖𝑗 𝑖=1 10)𝑘 𝑗=1 (K) (27) However, it may be more convenient to implement the net microwave"}
