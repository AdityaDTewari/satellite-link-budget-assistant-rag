STD terminals will be installed at 68 communities scattered through the eight participating States. Of these terminals, 56 will be at rural schools. The others will be located at the 12 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations in the region, enabling these stations to carry the programs during the actual satellite broadcasts or to videotape and play them at some other time. 13-94 Twenty-four of the rural schools, three per State, have been selected as \"In­ tensive Sites.\" During a segment of live broadcasting, these sites will have two-way audio communication capabilities through the use of the ATS-3 satellite, which has been in orbit since the late 1960s. This enables the programmers to respond instan­ taneously to and participate in the actual programming. Participants at one Intensive Site will be able to- communicate simultaneously both with Denver and with partici­ pants at other Intensive Sites. One of the key features of the demonstration, this capability will be studied for its implications on future educational and telecommuni­ cations activities. The other 32 rural schools, as well as the 12 PBS stations, are designated Receive-Only Terminals. They will receive the same radio and color TV signals as the Intensive Sites, but will not have two-way capability. The STD also will originate adult, community-oriented programming to the 56 participating rural schools one evening every third week, focusing on subjects of concern discovered in surveys of the communities.
