These ter­ minals employed newly developed 500-MHz bandwidth cooled parametric amplifiers, as well as 500-MHz bandwidth high power traveling-wave tube transmitters, capable of over 6 kW of multicarrier power. The INTELSAT IV spacecraft have advanced satellite communications technology by demonstrating the feasibility of fixed narrow beamwidth (i.e., 4. 5 ) antennas mounted on a mechanically despun platform and a highly channelized satellite repeater (i. e., 12 independent transponders). The narrow-beam antennas provide coverage to a fixed, relatively restricted arda'of th earti with high antenna gain significantly in­ creasing satellite EIP. The 12 transponders, each having a 36-MHz bandwidth, allow users with substantially different communication requirements to operate inde­ pendently of each other in separate satellite channels (e. g., television distribution in one channel, high-capacity telephone trunks in another, 'and ilow-duty cycle individual voice links in still another).
