Approximately one year after launch, the ATS-6 will be moved eastward to 350 east longitude which is over the eastern edge of Lake Victoria, located in Kenya, East Africa. From this position, the spacecraft will be \"visible\" to the subcontinent 13-58 1 * of India. It will then be used by the Indian Government 4 hours a day for 1 year to conduct the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE). For SITE, ATS-6 will be used to broadcast instructional and educational tele­ vision programs to 5000 villages and cities in seven states throughout India. About 2400 villages will receive the programs directly from ATS-6 using small, low-cost ground stations. The remaining 2600 villages will be located near rediffusion trans­ mitting stations and will receive the programs using conventional VHF television sets. Programs will stress improved agricultural techniques, family planning and hygiene, school instruction and teacher education; and occupational skills. Because of the large number of languages and dialects spoken in India, each video channel will be accompanied by two audio channels in different languages. In mid-July, 1975 the ATS-6 will be used to track and relay TV and other data from the Apollo-Soyuz spacecraft as they orbit the earth in a 10-day joint U. S. -U. S. S. R. experiment to advance international cooperation in manned flight. (37) * 13.4.2 Spacecraft Figure 13-13 shows the ATS-6 spacecraft's size and structural elements. Fig­ ure 13-14 details the communications package located in the Earth Viewing Module (EVM). Spacecraft characteristics are summarized in Tables 13-29 through 13-31.
