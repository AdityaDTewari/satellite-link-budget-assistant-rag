(2) Nominal value. Ranged up to 20000 K on some ships. (3) Antenna switched depending on elevation angle. (4) After positioning, antenna is slaved to ship's gyro-system to follow movement In azimuth plane. (5) On some large ships a dual antenna system, one forward and one aft of the ship's superstructure is used. The antenas are automatically switched to provide an unobscured satellite view. (6) Submarine used UIlF SATCOM antenna system employing a helx antenna (4 to 5 dB gain) for high elevation angles and a dipole antenna (2 dB gain) for low eleva­ tion angles. (7) Derived value based on data available. Table 14-9. Characteristics of SHF Earth Terminals Terminal AN/HSC-57 Parabolic 9 c n 'IA jsn1 diameter 33.5 dB 54((I) 3.4'@ 3 O pts.
