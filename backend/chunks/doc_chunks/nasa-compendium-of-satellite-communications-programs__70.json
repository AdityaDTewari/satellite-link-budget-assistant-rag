Therefore, any of the commonly conceived multiple­ access techniques (e. g., time, frequency, and code-division multiple access) could have been employed. Frequency division was used because of its ready compatibility with common existing earth terminal technology. For a perfectly spherical reflector with a smooth skin, there are likewise no satellite-imposed restrictions on the RF modulation technique employed. However, for a deformed reflector with a wrinkled skin, both fading and limitations on the coherent bandwidth are imposed. Frequency modulation (FM) is normally effective in the face of fading as long as the coherent bandwidth of the channel isn't exceeded. Large margins are required for an opera­ tional system of this sort. Margins, for a perfectly reflecting sphere, must account for variations in range, atmospheric and ionospheric attenuation and noise, antenna tracking and polarization losses, and ground terminal performance. For an imperfect sphere such as Echo I, margins must be further increased to account for signal fading due to scattering off the balloon surface and changes in the instantaneous reflective cross sectional area. 3-9 Signal processing techniques were basically the same for Echo II as for Echo I. Performance was improved somewhat primarily due to an average reflective cross sectional area that was 3 dB larger, slightly shorter ranges to the satellite, and the fact that the balloon shape did not deteriorate as a function of time. Additionally, both frequency and space diversity were tried as means of combating coherent fading. Table 3-6.
