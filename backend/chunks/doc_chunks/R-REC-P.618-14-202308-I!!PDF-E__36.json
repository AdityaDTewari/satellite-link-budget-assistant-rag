ITU-R P.618 -14 The sky noise temperature at a ground station antenna may be estimated by: Tsky = Tmr (1 – 10–A/10) + 2.7 × 10–A/10 K (69) where: Tsky : sky noise temperature (K) at the ground station antenna A : total atmospheric attenuation excluding scintillation fading (dB) Tmr : atmospheric mean radiating temperature (K). When the surface temperature Ts (K) is known, the mean radiating temperature, Tmr, may be estimated for clear and cloudy weather as: Tmr = 37.34 + 0.81 × T S K (70) In the absence of local data, an atmospheric mean radiating temperature, Tmr, of 275 K may be used for clear and rainy weather. The noise environments of stations on the surface of the Earth and in space are treated in detail in Recommendation ITU-R P.372. For satellite telecommunication systems using the geostationary orbit, earth stations will find that the Sun and, to a lesser extent, the Moon, are significant noise sources at all frequencies, and the galactic background is a possibly significant consider ation at frequencies below about 2 GHz (see Recommendation ITU -R P.372). In addition, Cygnus A and X, Cassiopeia A, Taurus and the Crab nebula may contribute to the sky background noise temperature. Refer to Recommendation ITU -R P.372 to determine the earth station system noise temperature from the brightness temperatures discussed above. 4 Cross -polarization effects Frequency reuse by means of orthogonal polarizations is often used to increase the capacity of space telecommunication systems. This technique is restricted, however, by depolarization on atmospheric propagation paths. Various depolarization mechanisms, es pecially hydrometeor effects, are important in the troposphere. Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization by the ionosphere is discussed in Recommendation ITU-R P.531."}
