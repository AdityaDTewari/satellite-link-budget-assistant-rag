With co_unication satellite systems incorporated inISDN, itisuseful to examine end-to-end system performance with tools such asANSX3.102. Work has already begun inthis area with CCITT Recommendation G.821 foranend-to-end bit error rate (BER) ofix10.6onsatellite trunks for ISDN service (Ports, 1987). Theperformance oftheB-channels (connection oriented circuit switched) canbequantified bytheperformance parameters identified forDAMA satellite systems. Theperformance oftheD-channels (packet switched) will require thecomplete setof21performance parameters tofully describe their performance. End-to-end system performance experiments for these satellite-augmented ISDNs canbedesigned using theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. These experiments would befundamentally the same asDAMAsatellite and ACTS system performance experiments. 4.ACTS OVERVIEW, OPERATION, ANDEND-TO-END SYSTEM P_FO_CE DEFINITIONS TheAdvanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) isthethird phase ofthe NASA 30/20 GHz program. Phase one was thedevelopment ofadvanced 30/20 GHzcommunication satellite technologies andlaboratory proof-of-concept 36 i1989010985-046 (POC) models. Phase two was the development and refinement ofthese technologies forspace applications (Moy, 1986). Andphase three, ACTS, isthe flight test bed forverifying the technology developments ofthe first two phases. Some ofthetechnology developments demonstrate are: Ka-band operation with 30GHz up-link and 20GHz down-link radio frequency (RF) components dual power, 20GHz, space-qualified traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA) Baseband Processor (BBP) foronboard baseband switching oftheuser's data traffic demand assignment multiple access (DAMA) operation multibeam communication package (MCP) with cross-polarized, scanning, spot beam antennas tofacilitate frequency reuse rain fade compensation via independent up-link anddown-link forward error correction (FEC) coding andlink power control. NASA issponsoring the development and construction ofACTS. NASA will launch ACTS with thespace shuttle andprovide operational support during a two- tothree-year experiment period. ACTS will beavailable free ofcharge to private industry, universities, and local, state and Federal Government agencies forconducting experiments anddemonstrating the feasibility ofits advanced systems. ACTS isnot intended tobearevenue-generating communication satellite. Itsprimary purpose istodemonstrate newtechnologies and ideas that maybe incorporated inanoperational advanced satellite system.
