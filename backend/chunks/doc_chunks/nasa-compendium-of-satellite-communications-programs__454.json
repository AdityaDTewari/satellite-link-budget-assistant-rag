(I ) A series of prior successful satellite developments and experiments in the Lincoln Experimental Satellite Program (see Section 9) led to a contract in January 1967 for the development of a prototype ver­ sion of an operational shtellite, the Tactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT). Specific objectives of the Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSATCOM) pro­ as listed in Table 14-1.(2)(3)(4)gram were Table 14-1. TACSATCOM Objectives Number Description 1 Develop, test, and experiment with space and surface hardware in UHF and SHE bands. 2 Develop, demonstrate, and evaluate operational concepts for use with many mobile tactical ter­ minals. These include problems of multiple access and power control. 3 Provide UHF voice link between the Apollo spacecraft and recovery aircraft, ships, and ground stations. An active repeater satellite was launched into a geostationary orbit (Table 14-2) and positioned over the United States. A successful testing program was conducted using this satellite, called TACSAT 1. The experiments involved a number of mobile terminals, specifically developed for the program, that can be divided into UHF and SHF types and subdivided by platform type. These are listed in Table 14-3.(5)(6) In addition, various other existing terminals were used for the TACSATCOM experiments. TACSATCOM is no longer a functioning system. TACSAT I provided service until 14-1 December 1972. Its 3-3/4 years of active life represented a longer period than that originally planned for experimental and operational testing. Up to the present there are no definite plans for a TACSAT 2, and it appears that Tactical Satellite Communications development will continue for the time being by the three services under their individual programs; for example, FLTSATCOM.
