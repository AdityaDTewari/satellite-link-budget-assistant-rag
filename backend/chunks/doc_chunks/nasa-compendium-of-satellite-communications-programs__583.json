All major heat dissipating components are mounted on the north-south panels which are covered with silvered quartz second surface mirrors to provide high infra-red emissivity (> 0. 8) 19-5 NORTH DEPLOYED SOLAR ARRAY MAIN BODY SUPER HIGH FREQUENCY GIMBALLED ANTENNAS / EAST WEST 1.4 M 0 (.6 FT) SHF BEACON ANTENNA TELEMETRY, TRACKING,a & COMMAND ANTENNA 6.52 M (21.4 FT) SOUTH DEPLOYED SOLAR ARRAY / ITCH1 1.3 M (4.3 FT) Figure 19-1. CTS Configuration On Station Showing Extendible Array Fully Deployed 19-6 and lower solar absorptivity (< 0. 08). The two most critical thermal problems are maintaining the dimensional stability of the forward deck and providing for the dissi­ pation of heat from the high power TWT. The forward deck must be stable to reduce the pointing error of the antenna system so it is thermally isolated from the rest of the spacecraft structure and insulated from space by multi-layer insulation blankets. The TWT waste heat dissipation problem is to be solved by direct radiation cooling from radiator plates connected to the multi-stage depressed collector (MDC). The MDC assembly extends beyond the aft platform directly exposed to the space environment to enhance the direct radiation cooling. 19.2.3 Antenna Subsystem The SHF communications antenna system consists of two gimballed 71.1 cm parabolic reflectors with 2.50 beamwidth mounted on the front deck and capable of positioning the electrical boresight anywhere within a 14. 50 cone about the normal to ° the deck. The pointing error relative to the deck is less than +0.1 which is suffi­ cient to provide an overall boresight pointing accuracy of ±0.2 0 Each antenna is capable"}
