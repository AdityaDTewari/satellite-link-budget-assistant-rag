Organizations participating in this experiment include: 1. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center 2. Department of Commerce/Maritime Administration (MarAd) 3. Department of Transportation a. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) b. U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) c. Transportation Systems Center (TSC) 4. European Space Research Organization (ESRO) 5. Canadian Department of Communications and Ministry of Transport During this experiment, performance tests will be conducted on several com­ munications and position-location techniques using the ATS-6 and ATS-5 spacecraft with airborne- planes and ships at sea. Other tests will include ground-based simula­ tion and engineering exercises. From its position at 94 degrees west longitude over the Galapagos Islands, ATS-6 will provide two-way communications between mobile units and ground stations located in a 1,081-kilometer (672-mile) wide area extending from the east coast of the U. S. two thirds of the way across the mid-Atlantic Ocean. Tests conducted between the ground stations and the aircraft and ships underway are designed to determine the effects of ionospheric, noise, and multipath disturbances as well as the geographic location of the tracked units on both L-Band communications and position l6cation techniques. Tests will encompass: * Communications link performance * Multi-access performance 13-112 \" Power and frequency control techniques * Quality and ranging precision for the various techniques under test Position location tests require altimeter readings from aircraft and accurate range measurements from each of the two ATS spacecraft and the aircraft or ship being tracked be known. Precise spacecraft location is obtained by a trilateration technique in which"}
