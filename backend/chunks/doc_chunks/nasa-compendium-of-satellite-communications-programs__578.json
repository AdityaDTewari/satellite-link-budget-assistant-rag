The United States portion of the project will be administered by NASA and will provide the launch vehicle, launch support, environmental test support, and a high power (-200 watts) TWT amplifier. The Canadian effort, directed by the Department of Communications, will be responsible for the design and construction of the spacecraft. Pursuant to this goal, Canada entered into an agreement on May 18, 1972 with the European Space Re­ search Organization (ESRO) which provides for European cooperation in the CTS proj­ ect through the development and supply of two 20 watt traveling wave tubes (TWT), a parametric amplifier, and the solar cell blankets to be used on CTS. The primary objective of the CTS'program is to provide a vehicle for experi­ mentation on the flexibility of satellite communication systems in the 12/14 GHz rekion. The program is expected to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of TV transmission at 12 GHz from satellite to low cost ground terminals, (2) demonstrate the feasibility of TV trans­ mission at 14 GHz from transportable and low cost fixed terminals to the satellite, and (3) develop and flight test components for use in future communications satellites. Ad­ ditionally, the CTS program will include experiments with audio broadcasts, two way telephony, and wideband data links. To meet these objectives the United States and Canada have agreed to initiate experimental programs designed to illustrate the adaptability of satellite systems to the distribution of information to sparsely settled areas. The programs are to"}
