This test was basically a ranging test to determine line-of-position of the ship. L-band ranging signals were transmitted from the Mojave ground station and relayed through ATS-5 to the ship. The MARAD project (Maritime Administration) was also conducted by Al. This was a successful test of real-time high speed (100 wpm) teletype (TTY) using standard equipment and relayed through ATS-5, two-way (not simultaneous), from Mojave to the Manhatten. The TT;f aboard the ship was unattended and running continuously. Among the other tests and experiments that have been conducted are the iono­ spheric propagation tests, an on-going experiment involving three ground stations at Quito, Lima, and Mojave that accepted fading and fading rate data from ATS-5 on L-band and VHF simultaneously; the Federal Aeronautics-Administration/Boeing Air­ craft Company experiment at L-band from ATS-5 to an aircraft involving measurements of multipath effects and tone ranging; the millimeter wave experiment conducted by Westinghouse for GSFC concerning the propagation correlation with rain, fading, and weather conditions at 31. 65-GHz uplink and 15 3-GHz downlink; and the AII/Wallops Island experiment in relative position (ranging).

(3 7 ) The 1974, at 9 a.m. primary objective of the Applications Technology Satellite-6 (ATS-6) is to demonstrate the feasibility of 9.1-meter (30-foot) diameter deployable spacecraft antenna with good RF performance up to 6 GHz. (38) In addition, the spacecraft is to provide an earth-synchronous-oriented platform stabilized along three axes for advanced tech­ nology and scientific experiments. The launch vehicle was a Titan IC missile. The * life expectancy of"}
