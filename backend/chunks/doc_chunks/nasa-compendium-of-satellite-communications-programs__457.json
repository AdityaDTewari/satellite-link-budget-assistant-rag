The modes were narrow-band FM voice, TATS, and broadcast alert. Table 14-5 presents the signal-processing techniques utilized in each mode. 14-4 Table 14-5.

The SHF band had a frequency plan that permitted great versatility in modes of operation. The frequency plan is shown in Figures 14-1 and 14-2. ( 5 ) InFigure 14-1, the composite plan for utilizing the 10-MHz satellite bandwidth is shown. Figure 14-2 shows the specific carrier frequencies for Bands A and B, which are the 50-kHz and 1-MHz satellite operating bandwidths, respectively. The center of these bands is coin­ cident with channel 3 shown in Figure 14-1. 14-5 ___"}
