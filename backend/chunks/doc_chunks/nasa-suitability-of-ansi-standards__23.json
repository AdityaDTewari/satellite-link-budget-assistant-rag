Secondly, these parameters canbeused tospecify theuser's requirements, giving theservice provider astarting point forthelink design. And finally, these parameters are relatively easy toobtain. Ifthelink budget has been calculated, the Bit/Block Error Probability andUser Information BitTransfer Rate areknown. TheTransfer Denial Probability canbedetermined from rain fade models (see Pritchard andSciulli, 1986) andtheBlock Transfer Time isknown apriori. If thelink budget parameters arenotavailable, link performance canbemeasured byend-to-end system performance experiments similar tothose mentioned in Section 4.3.4 and described inANSI (1987).These experiments are greatly simplified fortype Aandtype Bcommunication satellite systems because the stazt ofblock transfer andtheendofblock transfer aretheonly reference events that need tobeobserved. 3.2 TDMA,SS/TDMA,andDAMA System Performance Parameters Time-dlvlslon multlple-access, SS/TDMA (type C),and DAMA communication satellite systems operate inatime-divlslon multiplex (TDM) fashion with typically only one carrier presented toasatellite transponder atatime. Each earth station inthenetwork buffers itsincoming terrestrial data traffic (ordigital signals from digital speech interpolation [DSI] processors), then transmits ittothe satellite atapreassigned time inahigh-rate burst (120 Mb/s forINTELSAT VI). The primary advantage ofTDMA systems isreduced traveling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) intermodulation distortion from having only onecarrier ata time. This allows more efficient useofthetransponder andgreater down-link power, because the TWTA can beoperated closer tosaturation. Another advantage isreduced earth station equipment costs forhigh-volume networks (Campanella etal.,1986). There are many TDMA systems currently planned and inoperation. The simplest, such asINTELSAT V(Trusty etal., 1986),use types Aand B communication satellites with global coverageand operate onapreassigned burst t:me plan (BTP) basis. SS/TDMA systems, such asINTELSAT VI(Trusty et al., 1986), use type Ccommunication satellites with switchable spot coverage antennas. These satellite-switched systems maximize the throughput ofthe 271989010985-037 r........... ............7 as-needed basis, thus reducing thenumber ofpermanently assigned transponders. DAMA systems, such asSatellite Business Systems (SBS) and TELECOM i (Feher, 1983), operate onashort-term orreal-time BTPassignment mode. These demand-assignment systems further enhance the"}
