Figure 1 shows the specific attenuation using the prediction method, calculated from 0 to 1 000 GHz at 1 GHz intervals, for a pressure of 1 013.25 hPa, temperature of 15 C for the cases of a water vapour density of 7.5 g/m3 (Standard) and a dry atmosphere (Dry). Near 60 GHz, many oxygen absorption lines merge together at sea -level pressures to form a single, broad absorption band, which is shown in more detail in Fig. 2. This Figure also shows the oxygen attenuation at higher altitudes, with the individual lines becoming resolved as the pressure decreases with increasing altitude. Some additional molecular species (e.g. oxygen isotopic species, oxygen vibrationally excited species, oz one, ozone isotopic species and ozone vibrationally excited species, and other min or species) are not included in the line -by-line prediction method. These additional lines are insignificant for typical atmospheres but may be important for a dry atmosphere.
