Inthis case, thelink C/Nmust be3dBgreater than thecomposite C/N. If allowed bysystem architecture, theuplink maybeassigned aC/Nvalue several dBmore than that ofthedownlink because resources forachieving ahigh C/N (e.g., high-power amplifiers) aremore readily available ontheground. 7.3.5.2 Power Budget Equation. Thepower budget equation relates thevalues ofC/NorC/kT forindividual uplinks ordownlinks tophysical system parameters. Itdefines thetrade-offs possible between system components performance levels andisthebasis ofthecurrent phase ofsystem design. In decibel form, thedownlink power budget equation is: where:C/N=Pt+Gt+Gr-Lfs-L1-Lrain -10logloJkB(Tr+Tsky)) Pt = Gt = Gr = Lfs = L1 = Lrain = k = B ._ Tr = Tsky =satellite transmitter power, dBW satellite antenna gain, dBi ground receiving terminal antenna gain, dBi free space path loss, dB attenuation losses which areconstant, especially gaseous absorption, dB attenuation from rain, dB Boltzmann's constant, 1.38 x10-23J/K (10lOglok =-228.6 dB-K'I-Hz -1) bandwidth, Hz receiving terminal noise temperature, K skynoise temperature, K Tocalculate C/kT, thebandwidth Bissimply left outoftheequation.
