SKYNET-1 Communications Transponder The received signal is 1. Isolated by polarization diversity in the orthomode transducer 2. Downconverted to IF 3. Split into separate channels for amplification and hard-limiting 4. Recombined and up-converted to output frequency 5. Amplified to output power in the TWT 6. Introduced into the communications antenna through the orthomode transducer A signature tone timing signal is frequency modulated on the beacon carrier and in2 troduced into the communication band in the channel summer. The communications antenna consists of the RF assembly mid the motor drive assembly (MDA). RF energy is circularly polarized, collimated into' a plane wave­ front and focused upon the flat plate reflector. The beam axis, reflected through a 90 0 angle, is continuously directed toward the subsatellite point by the despun mo­ tion of the radiating aperture. A rotary choke joint at the lower' end of the MDA housing permits efficient transfer of energy between the spacecraft fixed and despun waveguide sections. A hydrazine reaction control subsysteni provides for attitude control and stationkeeping and, in addition, permits the relocation-of the SKYNET satellite to a more optimum location if system requirements change. Three redundant antenna pointing control systems are provided -earth horizon sensors, sun angle sensors, and a backup earth-to-satellite, command link. A UHF subsystem, also redundant, is provided for telemetry tracking and command serv­ ices (TT&C). Figure 15-4(12) is"}
