Sections 3and4ofthis report address this forseveral classes ofcommunication satellites. Table 2lists, inmatrix _orm, the21ANSX3.102 performance parameters defined inANSI (1983). Listed are 17primary performance parameters that quantify theperformance criteria (speed, accuracy, and reliability) for the three communication system functions (access,user information transfer, anddisengagement). Thetable also shows four ancillary parameters that relate the user's impact onthe speed ofthe three system functions. TheANSX3.102 performance parameters aredefined insuch awaythat they canbeapplied toanydata communication system orservice foralltopologies, protocols, codes, orother design characteristics (ANSI, 1987). They apply to both connection-oriented systems like thepublic-switched telephone network, and connectionless packet-switched networks like ARPANET. Also,unlike most standards, ANS X3.102 gives only the parameter definitions, not specific parameter values.Thevalues oftheparameters aredetermined bythecontext ofthe user's specific requirements. Additionally, only asubset ofthe performance parameters need bespecified ifitfully describes the user's performance requirements. 2.1.1 Access Four primary performance parameters andoneancillary performance parameter are defined for the access function.These parameters are Access Time, Incorrect Access Probability, Access Denial Probability, Access Outage Probability, andUser Fraction ofAccess Time (see Table 2). ANSI (1983) and Seitz and Grubb (1983) give justifications for the selection ofthese parameters andtheir mathematical definitions. Theaccess function isdefined asfollows: Theaccess function begins upo'_ issuance ofan\"access request\" signal oritsimplied equivalent attheinterface between auser andthedata communication system. Itends when the first bit ofsource user information isinput tothesystem (after connection establishment in connection-oriented services). It includes all activities traditionally associated with physical circuit establishment (e.g., dialing, switching, andringing) aswell asanyactivities performed at higher protocol"}
