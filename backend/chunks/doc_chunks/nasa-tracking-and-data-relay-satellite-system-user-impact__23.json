For these bands the same antenna types are applicable; the only differences being a scaling of size and weight. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are based on data presented in Section 4.4. Not all configurations of the same generic type of antenna are included. For example, only a disc-on-rod antenna is included for endfire type antennas, although there are many others -- helix, pokyrod, yagi, etc. Typical families of antennas representative of different types are summarized in Section 4.4. This collection although not exhaustive serves as a basis of comparison of different generic types by categorizations according to gain, size, weight, etc. 4.2.1 Antenna Environments and Antenna/Spacecraft Interaction The immediate area in the vicinity of the antenna elements is considered the antenna \"environment.\" The detailed constituencies and characteristics of this environment have a profound effect on the shape of the resulting antenna radiation pattern. As frequencies become higher and consequently wavelengths smaller, the interacting effect between the antenna elements and the surrounding environment begins to decrease thus allowing the radiation pattern to become more purely the result of the antenna elements themselves. (6) Thus, the effects of booms, other antennas, protruding equipment, supporting structures, and even the basic spacecraft structure itself present a variety of critical interacting influences. For the most part ascertaining these effects analytically is difficult and experi- mental techniques must be resorted to by the spacecraft designer. 4-5 Table 4.1 Classification of Omnidirectional Antennas $cc 0 0 0 0 * cd 4 V0"}
