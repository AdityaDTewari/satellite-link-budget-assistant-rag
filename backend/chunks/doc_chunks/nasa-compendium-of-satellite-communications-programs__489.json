Most electrical design features, Apart from redundancy, are commonly used with the, Type 11 station to simplify training and maintenance support. The Type I antenna is a 13-meter (42-foot) diameter parabolic reflector with a Cassegrain feed system mounted on a fully steerable azimuth elevation mount which is, installed on a three-legged gantry. Azimuth rotation is accomplished by two dc motors driving in a countertorque configuration to minimize backlash. The elevation drive consists of two mechanically coupled recirculating ball screws. The Type II antenna mount is fundamentally different. To meet the original air-transportability specification, a double-walled inflatable radome was used with a non-orthogonal mount. This mount allowed the antenna to be more readily de­ mounted into pieces of.a size suitable for the aircraft, and also produced a smaller swept volume than a standard azimuth-elevation mount, thus requiring a smaller radome. The profile of the Type I main and subreflectors has been shaped from the para­ boloid to ensure a nearly uniform illumination of the main reflector. With this tech­ nique, overall antenna efficiency and gain are increased. The composite four-horn feed consists of four horns, four circular polarizers and diplexers, transmit power dividers and static split combination networks. The Type I and Il station receiving systems are similar except that the system is duplicated in the Type I station, with a remotely controlled waveguide changeover 15-18 Table 15-8.
