Additionally, this spacecraft will investigate uplink RFI at 6 GHz, millimeter wave propagation at 20 and 30 GHz, and signal attenuation at 13 and 18 GHz caused by atmospheric hydrometers. The CTS satellite will include a super-efficiency power transmitting tube, pro­ viding a 200-watt minimum output at 12 GHz, extendable solar power arrays of approxi­ mately 1. 5-kilowatt initial capability, and three-axis stabilization using flexible appendages. High power RF transmitters at frequencies about 10 GHz and prime power sources of kilowatt size or greater represent technology that will be needed for educational and community TV satellite broadcast systems, interplanetary space probes, and large earth-orbiting platforms. In addition to the advanced technology experiments, CTS will provide the vehicle for investigating numerous user applica­ tions. These may include educational TV, biomedical networks, law enforcement networks, and service for the handicapped applications. 1-24 The U. S. Domsat program provides the potential for supplying point-to-point trunk and multipoint message telephone; telegraphic and wideband data; and network, educational, and community antenna television services that complement and improve the services presently provided by terrestrial facilities. Eight applicants filed for permits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to construct U. S. domestic satellite systems by the March 15, 1971, filing deadline. The Commission's invitation to file covered systems \"for multiple or specialized common carrier ser­ vices, for lease to other common carriers, for private use, joint coopeiative use, or any combination of such services. \" As of the fall of 1974, five participants were still in evidence on the Domsat scene. Three of these were actively participating in domestic satellite communications, one via its own satellite (Western Union via Westar), the other two via leased circuits on Westar or Telesat (Anik).
