In addition to a redundant wideband communication system, the spacecraft had a radiation experiment package, electrical power system, command and telemetry systeni, and supporting structure. Satellite operating frequencies are given in Table 7-3. The characteristics of the spacecraft and the ground stations are described in Sections 7. 3 and 7. 4, respectively. Table 7-3.

The orbit was selected to meet the following requirements: 1. To maximize satellite mutual visibility above a 5-degree horizon between U.S. and Europe. A minimum of 100 minutes per day during the first 30 days was the achieved design objective 2. To provide acceptable mutual visibility times for the test stations and smaller ground stations 3. To traverse a radiation environment suitable for evaluation by the on-board radiation experiments 4. To minimize the simultaneous occurrence of mutual visibility times and eclipses 7-4 5. The sun look angle was to lie between 90 + 15 degrees for the first 30 days in orbit with a maximum deviation of + 31 degrees for a year's orbit 6. The launch trajectory was to be consistent with the range safety require­ ments at the Atlantic Missile Range. Relay 11 was launched into a slightly higher orbit because of improved launch vehicle performance. 7.3 SPACECRAFT Except as noted, the Relay I and Relay II spacecraft exhibited no essential differences. The principal characteristics of the spacecraft are presented in Table 7-4. Two completely independent microwave transponders were provided for increased reliability; their configuration is shown in Figure 7-1. Two modes of operation"}
