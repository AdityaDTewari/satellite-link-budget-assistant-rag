As development and launching of the initial five satellites proceeded, and NASA began to look towards the future, the main thrust of the ATS program objectives became more exclusively communications oriented. NASA's ATS research effort is now directed towards advanced techniques for bringing satellite communications to an ever-increasing number of small, perhaps mobile, users having multiple access to the satellite system; toward broadcast satellite applications, both radio and tele­ vision; toward more efficient techniques of frequency utilization through investigation of millimeter wavelengths; and toward satellite aids to lunar, planetary, and inter­ planetary communications. ATS-6, a high power, three-axis stabilized spacecraft featuring a deployable 9.1-m (30-foot) parabolic reflector antenna, was sent into a near perfect, earth syn­ chronous orbit on 30 May 1974. Paragraph 13.4 discusses the ATS-6 program in de­ tail. (37) ATS-F', a backup to ATS-6, is partially fabricated and is awaiting funding approval, (48) 13.2 SPIN STABILIZED SATELLITES 13.2. 1 General Description The experiments carried on the spin stabilized Applications Technology Satel­ lites can be grouped into seven major categories. These categories are listed and defined in Table 13-1. (3)(4) Primary objectives of the SHF (C-Band) communications experiments were to: (1) evaluate a multiple access system having a 1200-channel capacity in voice, teletype, data, and facsimile modes of operation; (2) evaluate 13-2 wideband transmission techniques;(3) investigate polarization and transmission phenomena; and (4) provide a communications transmission capability in support of other ,applications technology satellite experiments. Major VH communications objectives were to demonstrate the feasibility of continuous air-to-ground and ship­ to-shore voice communications through a satellite. The satellite VHIF transponder also provided the opportunity to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of a meteorological network in which data from small unmanned stations are collected at a central station for dissemination to all interested stations within"}
