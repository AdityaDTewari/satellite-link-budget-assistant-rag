The primary technological experiment of the CTS program, however, is in the transmitter experiment package (TEP). The TEP consists of a high efficiency SHP 200 watt TWT and its power processor. The tube is being constructed along tech­ niques developed at NASA's Lewis Research Center for multi-stage depressed col­ lectors. The output of the 200 watt TWT is based on a 50% efficiency at 12 GHz. The successful operation of such a tube would significantly advance high power satellite technology. The specifications for the 200 watt TWT are given in Table 19-2 and a typical schematic of this type tube is shown in Figure 19-3. 19-9 P13 &O,$WROtM o t o~ ap 1.-­ \"LC SHF TRANSPONDER RBI/TBI R52/T82 200W 20W CHANNEL '\"\"'\" CHANNEL-PIAYMD Figure2SPR ExFiur 1T2RANSCmmniPONsERimn M Em Table 19-2. 200 Watt TWT Specifications 1.
