There islittle experimental datafor cloud attenuation, andvirtually nolongterm statistics.Fortunately,the additional attenuation duetoclouds appears tobeonly afraction ofthat due toclear airformost types ofclouds, andasmallerfraction ofthat dueto rain. Thegreatest amount ofcloud attenuation intheabsence of precipitation seems tobecaused bycumulonimbus clouds, which accompany thunderstorms. Thecloud attenuation accompanying athunderstorm maybea prologueorepilogue ofthegreater attenuation ofthethundershower, ormay beexperienced without theaccompanying rainfall. Therelative frequency of these three possibilities would, ontheaverage, dependupon theazimuth of theground station beam compared with theprevalent direction oftravel of local thunderstorm activity.
