As a multi-purpose telecommuni­ cations system providing television, radio, voice, data and facsimile transmission services, it was originally designed to meet the initial requirements of Telesat's cus­ tomers and to be interlinked with existing terrestrial systems. However, as further requirements have been raised, changes have been made to some of the earth stations and many additional facilities are being implemented. 18 2 *\"ANIK Launch Handbook,\" Hughes Aircraft Company, October 1972 Figure 18-1.
