Rather, only thetotal time isgiven. Thenature ofrain attenuation, however, issuch that theexceedance periods areusually ontheorder of minutes inlength. Different phenomena besides rain give rise toattenuation variationsoccurringonatime scaleofseconds.

Needless tosay, applicable millimeter-wave attenuation measurements spanning many years seldom exist. Itistherefore necessarytoestimate statistics, using whatever information isavailable. 210 Anestimate oftherainattenuation cumulative statistics maybe determined inseveralways.Theoptimumwaydependsontheamountofrain and/orattenuation dataavailable, andonthelevelofsophistication desired. However, itisrecommended thatthesimplest calculations becarried outfirsttoprovideanapproximation forthestatistics andalsotoactasa checkontheresultsofmoresophisticated calculations. Theflow chartsinFigures 6.3-Iand6.3-9 will assist with deciding which calculation procedures aretobepursued. Thestepsarenumbered sequentially toallow easy reference with theaccompanying discussions in Sections 6.3.2, 6.3.3 and6.3.4. These aretheprocedures given: AnalyticalEstimates(Section 6.3.2, Figure 6.3-1). Requires onlyEarth stationlocation, elevation angle, andfrequency. EstimatesGiven Rain Rate Statistics (Section 6.3.3, Figure 6.3-1). Requires cumulative rain rate exceedance statisticsfor vicinity oftheEarth stationlocation. Estimates Given RainRate andAttenuation Statistics (Section 6.3.4, Figure 6.3-9).Requires attenuation statistics which may beforfrequency andelevation angle different from those needed. 6.3.1.3 Other Considerations. Generally theyearly cumulative statistics are desired. Theworst-month or30-day statistics aresometimes also needed, but arenotderivable from thedata presented here. Worst 30-day statistics are discussed inSection 6.3.7. Theattenuationevents duetoliquid rain onlyareconsidered here. Liquid rain isthedominate attenuation-producing speciesbecause itsspecific attenuation isconsiderably higher than snow,ice,fog, etc. Thecontribution ofthese otherhydrometeors isestimated inlater sections. 211 Thecumulative statistics areappropriate forearth-space paths for geostationary ornear-geostationary satellites with relatively stable orbital positions. Themodifications required todevelop statistics forlow-orbiting satellitesisunclearbecause ofthepossibly nonuniform spatial distribution ofrainevents arising from local topography (lakes, mountains,"}
