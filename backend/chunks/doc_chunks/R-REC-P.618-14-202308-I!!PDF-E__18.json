Curves giving the variation of worst -month values from their mean are provided in Recommendation ITU-R P.678. 2.2.3 Variability in space and time of statistics Precipitation attenuation distributions measured on the same path at the same frequency and polarization may show marked year -to-year variations. In the range 0.001% to 0.1% of the year, the attenuation values at a fixed probability level are observed to v ary by more than 20% r.m.s. When the models for attenuation prediction or scaling in § 2.2.1 are used to scale observations at a location to estimate for another path at the same location, the variations increase to more than 25% r.m.s. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 13 2.2.4 Site diversity Intense rain cells that cause large attenuation values on an Earth -space link often have horizontal dimensions of no more than a few kilometres. Diversity systems able to re -route traffic to alternate earth stations, or with access to a satellite with extr a on-board resources available for temporary allocation, can improve the system reliability considerably. Site diversity systems are classified as balanced if the attenuation thresholds on the two links are equal, and unbalanced if the attenuation threshol ds on the two links are not equal. At frequencies above 20 GHz, path impairments other than rain can also affect site diversity performance. There are two site diversity predictions models: – the prediction method described in § 2.2.4.1 that is applicable to unbalanced and balanced systems and computes the joint probability of exceeding attenuation thresholds; and – the prediction method described in § 2.2.4.2 that is applicable to balanced systems with short distances and computes the diversity gain. The prediction method described in § 2.2.4.1 is the most accurate"}
