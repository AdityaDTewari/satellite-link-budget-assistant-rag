The total coverage at any one time consists of two footprints'lying in approximately a North-South relation­ ship, the exact arrangement depending on the subsatellite point and the antenna point­ ing angle. Either or both feeds can be energized on command; however the -frequency is different in each footprint. It can be seen by exainining the chart that the to foot­ prints which can be generated cannot cover all of the participating states."}
