Communication with ATSOCC is accomplished by one voice circuit and one full duplex TTY circuit. Figure 13-21 shows the Mojave Ground Station Block Diagram. H Figure 13-21. Mojave Ground Station Block Diagram Spacecraft commands are encoded, transmitted and verified by the T&C system. Spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and discrete real-time functions are also received; processed, recorded, and displayed by the telemetry subsystem. 13.4.4.4 Hybrid Terminal ( 4 1 ) The Hybrid Terminal is operationally quite similar to the lMojave station. The terminal is composed of the Mobile Terminal (less power generation equipment), three personnel vans, and the T&C, ATS-R and computer trailers from the trans­ portable ground station. Two of these trailers have removable sides so that, when on site, they can be mated together side by side to form a single complete operation control complex (000) with access to all subsystems, with the exception of T&C. The T&0 system is contained in a separate trailer. This system, which is basically the same for all of the ground stations, is integrated with the 000 so that overall 13-84 control of the station can be maintained from one point. Spacecraft commands are encoded, transmitted and verified by therT&C system. Spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and discrete real-time functions are also received, processed, recorded and displayed by the telemetry subsystem. The station master control console, from which all monitoring and control func­ tions are handled, is located in the attached trailers. Communications with ATSOCC is is accomplished by one SCAMA voice circuit and one full duplex TTY circuit. Figure 13-22 shows the Transportable Ground Station (TGS) Block Diagram.
