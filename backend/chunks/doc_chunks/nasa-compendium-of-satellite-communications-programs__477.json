During 1963 and 1964 subsequent studies proceeded toward a goal of choosing an optimum system. Meanwhile, the U.S. was planning the deployment of its Interim Defense Satellite Communication System (IDSCS).. The U.S. intended to devote the first year of IDSCS to testing, and the U.K. was invited to participate in the test phase. The U.K. program to participate in the IDSCS testing consisted of building five earth stations and work began on these stations in 1965."}
