Themodels provide either rain rate statistics orattenuation statistics. Generally, these statistics canberelated byuseofthespecific attenuation andeffective path length relations. Specific attenuation has been described inchapter II,while theeffective path length will be summarized attheendofthis chapter. Forexample, theRice-Holmberg model only computes theexceedance probability statistics forrain rate, butthis is relatable toattenuation byuseofthespecific attenuation andtheeffective path length. TheDutton-Dougherty andGlobal models provide theattenuation statistics given thegeographic andlink parameters. That is,they give the rain rate statistics within themodel.r TheLinandPiecewise Uniform Rain Rate models require aknown setof rain rate statistics togenerate theattenuation statistics. These models relate aspecific ground point rain rate tothesimultaneous attenuation along thepath. 3.1.2 Concepts ofRainfall Statistics 3.1.2.1Cumulative Statistics. Thecumulative statistics foreither rain rate orattenuation areusually presented astheprobability ofexceedance (abscissa) versus therain rate orattenuation (ordinate). They represent stable statisticsaveraged over aperiod sufficiently long that variations in thelowest frequency component ofthetime distribution areaveraged. For rain rate andrain attenuation theperiod corresponding tothelowest frequency isgenerally consideredto beoneyear. Higher frequency components aretheseasonal anddaily variation oftherain rate. Forexample, inthe eastern US,thehigher frequency co_onents arise because more rain falls in thesummer than inthewinter, andmore rain falls between noon and6PMthan between 6AMandnoon local time. Some people have suggested that thell-year solar cycle isthelowest frequency component, butthis hasnotbeen observed bytheWeather Service. 43 Based ontheabove considerations thecumulativestatisticsfor several years arerequired before \"stable\" annual statistics areobtained. Forthis reason, experimentally generated data bases forboth rain and attenuation arenotgenerally good until 5orlOyears ofdata areincluded. However,because ofthelimited lifetimeofthebeacon satellites,attenuation data ataknown frequency andelevation angle isgenerally notavailable for this length ofperiod (Kaul etal-lg77). Therefore datafrom several satelliteslaunched over along period arerequired. -Since they arenotat thesame frequency andelevation angle, these results must bescaledinorder tobecombined. Frequently this processhasnotbeen done accurately, resulting insmall segmentsofattenuation data which arenotrepresentative ofthelong term statistics.,• .. .! :•..:'/-- , .Z Based ontheabove discussionsitappears that theonly present recourse istoutilize rain•rate dataasderivable from Weather Bureau or"}
