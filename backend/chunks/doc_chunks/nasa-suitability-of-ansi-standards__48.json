Table 6lists some ofthe ACTS LBR system factors (system configurations) andtheir levels that could bemeasured. Themost significant factors arethedifferent data rates, theeffect ofthefade compensation, and performance asafunction oftraffic load. 4.3.1 ACTS User/System Interfaces Thefirst task when designing auser-oriented system pe_formance experimeht istoidentify theuser/system interface. Figure iiillustrates thebasic ACTS LBRuser/system interfaces options. The primary interface point isthe ACTS Central Office (CO) equipment, which looks and functions like a terrestrial, telephone system central office. Thespecific u.._r interface data rates andprotocols depend oiltheinterface options implemented int,,eACTS CO, but thebasic intent isforACTS toappear totheusers like aterrestrial telephone system. Theuser goes \"off hook\" (orinstructs their modem togooff hook), receives a\"dial tone,\" dials thenumber, hea_-s a\"ring-back\" fr_m t_,_ destination, andwaits forthedestina_:ion user toanswer.
