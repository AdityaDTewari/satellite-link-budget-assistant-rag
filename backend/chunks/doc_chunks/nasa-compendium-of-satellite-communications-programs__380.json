This indicates that the loss is occurring in the solid state multiplier chain above the L-Band portion where the receiver local oscillator power is coupled out. The exact location and cause of the failure has not been determined. The backup millimeter wave transmitter showed normal power characteristics from launch until October 22, 1969. The transmitter output power was then observed to decrease over time periods as short as 2-1/2 hours and as long as 9 hours to a level between 3 and 4 dB below normal output at which time the output abruptly dropped to zero. A period of nonoperation has always restored the transmitter to normal output. A loss in dc input power that correlates with the loss of RF output power has been recorded. It has been evident that the thermal sensitivity of the transmitter is responsible for the power loss. 13.3.6.1 Additional Services ATS-5 The NASA/GSFC L-band ranging and position location experiments, conducted from the Mojave ground station to the ATS-5 satellite, demonstrated the ability to obtain meaningful range measurements using PM tone modulation at L-band carrier frequencies. This experiment demonstrated the capability of obtaining ranging measurements between an earth station and the ATS-5 satellite at L-band and C-band carrier frequencies, and to evaluate the relative accuracy to which these measure­ ments can be made. Applied Information Industries (AI) conducted the Alpha II Project for SAMSO, U.S. Air Force, by doing simultaneous L-and C-band ranging using ATS-5. AlI also 13-55 performed a ranging test for the Maritime Administration using the tanker, USS Man­ batten. This test was basically a ranging test to determine line-of-position of the ship. L-band ranging signals were transmitted from the Mojave ground station and relayed through ATS-5 to the ship. The MARAD project (Maritime"}
