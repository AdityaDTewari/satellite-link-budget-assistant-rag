This continued until the first worldwide militarr satellite communications system became operational and was able to assume the communications load (see Section 12). The principal earth terminals involved in the program were 'supplied by the U. S. Department of Defense and are indicated in Table 8-2. (3) (4) (6-11) Satellite 8-i Table 8-1.
