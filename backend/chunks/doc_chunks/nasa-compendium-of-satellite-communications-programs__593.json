Canada This experiment will evaluate the reception, in a metropolitan environment, of 12 GHz TV signals transmitted by CTS. Canada The usefulness and technical feasibility of the CTS Radio Broadcast System for (1) delivery of network service to remote communities, (2) transmissions of broadcast material from one remote community to another, (3) trans­ mission of special-interest material for direct reception and (4) transmission of news or in­ formation back to main network points for inclusion in network programs will be tested.

Canada The objective of this experiment is to investigate the feasibility of using a synchronous communi­ cations satellite to transmit the position of a train on rail lines of low capacity. Carleton University with Stanford University and NASA-Ames Research Center will develop, dem­ onstrate and evaluate college curriculum sharing techniques using a digital video-compression. system.
