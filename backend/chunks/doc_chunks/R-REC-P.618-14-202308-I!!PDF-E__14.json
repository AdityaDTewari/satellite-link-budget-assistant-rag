These rain attenuation statistics can be computed from the local measured rain attenuation (i.e. excess attenuation in addition to gaseous attenuation, cloud attenuation, and scintillation fading) data or from the rain attenu ation prediction method in § 2.2.1.1 for the specific location and path elevation angle of interest. The rain attenuation statistics at frequencies f1 and f2 should be derived from the same source. The procedure has been tested at frequencies between 19 and 50 GHz, but is recommended for frequencies up to 55 GHz. The following parameters are required: f1: lower frequency at which the rain attenuation is known (GHz) Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 11 f2: higher frequency at which the rain attenuation is predicted (GHz) Prain: probability of rain (%) 1: mean of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f1 2: mean of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f2 1: standard deviation of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f1 2: standard deviation of the log -normal distribution of rain attenuation at frequency f2. For each frequency, f1 and f2, perform a log -normal fit to the rain attenuation vs. probability of occurrence as follows: Step 1: Calculate Prain (%), the time percentage of rain on the path. Prain can be predicted by P0 (Lat, Lon) from"}
