In SSB/FM mode, half power BW was 115 KHz .At 20 dB down points on spacecraft antenna pattern,varies from +12 Hz at a maximum to -46 Hz minimum Signal to thermal noise ratio was measured to be 36 dB* at earth station transmitter power output of 50 dBm. S/N decreased linearly with decrease in SSB transmitter power By modulating uplink power in synchronism with spacecraft spin and such as to compensate for variations in satellite receive antenna pattern, usable uplink window was increased from 52 ms to 100 ms * At Mojave terminal. The only significant operational difficulties encountered on ATS-5 have involved the primary and backup millimeter wave transmitters. (35), (36) The main transmitter functioned perfectly during the first 3 months in orbit. On November 22, 1969, however, the output power was down 6 dB at turn-on. This condition continued until December 17 when a further 3 dB loss was recorded. Transmitter power has remained stable at this level to the present writing. The dc input power has shown no change from pre-launch level during this entire time. Further the 30. 6 GHz local oscillator power has shown no significant change. This indicates that the loss is occurring in the solid state multiplier chain above the L-Band portion where the receiver local oscillator power is coupled out. The exact location and cause of the failure has not been determined. The backup millimeter"}
