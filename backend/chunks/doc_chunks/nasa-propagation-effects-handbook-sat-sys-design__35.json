The data show that theaverage annual clock t-min rainfall rate foreach ofthe modes isfairly constant. Ontheother hand, thetotal number ofrainy t-min periods foreach mode isrelatively much more variable from yearLto-year and between stations orclimate regions. Rainfall climates defined byBarry and Chorley (Ig70) fortheUnited States were found tocorrespond very well with observed regional variations oftheparameter B• Theaverage annual total oft-min periods ofMode 1andMode 2 rainfall areTltandT2t,respectively. Theaverage annual Mode 1and Mode 2rainfall rates aretherefore Rlt:MI/TIt mm/h R2t=M2/T2t mm/h Note that MlandM2arenotfunctions oft,since theamount ofrainfall collected over along period oftime does notdepend ontheshort-term recording interval t.Butthetotal number ofhours TltorT2tofrainy t-min intervals (collecting atleast 0.01 inor0.254 mmofrain perinterval) will dependont.
