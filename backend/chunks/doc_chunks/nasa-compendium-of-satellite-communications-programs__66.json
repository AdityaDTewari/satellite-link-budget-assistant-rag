Valuable information was contributed towards meeting all the program objectives listed in Table 3-1. Numerous terminals from various countries conducted communications operations with the Echo satellites in response to an open invitation by NASA for worldwide utiliza­ tion. Some of the major participating terminals are listed in Table 3-3. (See references 1, 5, and 8 through 12.) Additionally, innumerable terminals distributed over the entire world, at one time or another, conducted radar or optical tracking operations with these satellites. NASA's minitrack network supplied the data from which Goddard Space Flight Center derived orbital tracking information for all interested parties. Satellite launchings were provided by NASA. The Echo program, which through Echo I provided the first extended satellite communications experiment, made a host of significant contributions to satellite communications technology. First, in reaching its major objective, it demonstrated the feasibility of using passive satellite reflectors for communication purposes and verified the theoretical limitations of such a system. Additionally, it verified the conventional theories for determining path loss on satellite links. Further, it fostered the development of much of the ground terminal technology that continues to be employed. Specific ground terminal items first demonstrated in the Echo project included a large-scale horn reflector antenna at Holmdel, low-noise receiver preamplifiers using solid state masers, frequency modulation feedback receivers, and satellite tracking of sufficient accuracy to allow real-time operational communica­ tions. Satellite tracking by radar, telescope, and computer predictions all proved to be quite reliable. Radar tracking operations included successful autotracking. 3.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system configuration for the major participants involved in the evaluation of communications via Echo I is depicted in Figure 3-1. (5) Separate transmitting and receiving antennas, each operating at different frequencies, were employed at both Goldstone and Holmdel to provide full"}
