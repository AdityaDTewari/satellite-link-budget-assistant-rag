The despun antenna experiment was carried on all three X-band satellites. On LES-1, the switched antenna functioned as expected during most of the first 10 orbital revolutions until conversion to the 60-rpm tumbling mode was completed (1 6 ) . On LES-2 operation was satisfactory and in agreement with expectations. The use 9-16 of conventional optics at visible wavelengths in conjunction with logic initially designed for IR sensors resulted in some anomalous operation (1 ) . 'Near satellite sunrise and sunset, the logic tended to lock on the sun rather than the earth. Moreover, the logic tended to point antennas toward the middle -of the dlluminated crescent rather than at the middle of the earth. The'se difficulties were- not 6rucial as the ground sites operated with daylight at both transmitter and receiver. On LES-4 the antenna system which measured earth direction during every satellite rotation also operated essentially correct. Operation occasionally broke up for typically tens of minutes in a 8-hour pass due to a defective circuit (14 ) . The second switching logic system on LES-4 could not operate properly at all since the satellite was not in a circular orbit. Measurements on the LET system included evaluations of the performance of RF equipment, antenna system, and signal processing system. In the two former areas, transmitter output power, receiver noise temperature, system bandwidth, (17)and antenna autotrack capability were particular parameters of interest These measurements demonstrated performance in agreement with specified values. Per­ formance of the signal processing system was demonstrated in 'tack-to-back\" testing. Both the voice-excited vocoder mode using remote speakers connected to the terminal through the commercial switched telephone network and the pitch-excited vocoder mode using local speakers displayed satisfactory operation. In both modes, familiar speakers could easily be detected. The frequency hopping, MFSK,"}
