SKYNET I \"A\" was suc­ cessfully launched into synchronous orbit in November 1969. SKYNET I \"B\" was launched in August 1970 and was a total loss when it failed to reach synchronous or­ bit. It was generally believed that the apogee kick motor used to circularize the­ orbit exploded. Table 15-1(1)(2)(3) summarizes launch and status information on the SKYNET satellites. Note that there is no SKYNET operational satellite at this time. The U.1K. is proceeding with the SKYNET II program which will consist of a larger spacecraft with a considerably higher EIRP. (20-watt TWT versus 3.'0-watt TWT.) The first attempt at launching a SKYNET II satellite in January 1974 resulted in a mission failure when the second stage of the Delta rocket misfired preventing achievement of a proper orbit. A second launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. The operational requirements dictated the use of nine earth stations, five of which were to be stationary and four mobile. The stationary stations are in the-U. K., Cyprus, Bahrain, Gan and Singapore. Although the stations are considered stationary, all stations with the exception of the U.K. station have been designed so that they can be moved if necessary. Two of the mobile stations are fitted in ships -the assault headquarters ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid. The last two stations are mobile stations ashore. These two terminals are to be held in strategic reserve and -deployed for contingency operations. Table 15-2(2)(4 9) is a summary of.the ter-' minals participating in the SKYNET Program. The operational aims are to provide long distance strategic point-to-point digital communications and to meet selected tactical communication needs with the mobile terminals. The central"}
