ITU-R P.676 -13 7 If available, local altitude profiles of p, e and T (e.g. usin g radiosondes) should be used. In the absence of local data, an appropriate reference standard atmosphere given in Recommendation ITU-R P.835 should be used. (Note that where total atmospheric attenuation is calculated, the same -water vapour partial pressure is used for the attenuation attributable to oxygen and the attenuation"}
