In July 1967 the Pacific network was placed in operational status, marking the beginning of DSCS integration into the DCS. 12.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The IDCSP has become an operational long-haul satellite comtmunications sys­ tem. A single-satellite is capable of'sipporting two duplex voice links, each link carrying five voice channels, but operationally, only one duplex link per satellite is allowed:t6: ensure adequate link margins. The system has;provided a wideband (450 kbps, 900 kbps under optimum conditions) operational capability for facsimile service over a two-satellite hop link from RVN to Washington, D. C. In addition, 'the istem has provided emergency communications when conventional systems have failed. For example, during the Middle East crisis in May and June 1967, HF radio suffered frequent outages and the West Germany -Ethiopia link provided a primary tracking facility. In September 1967 the Hawaii-RVN link carried five, of the highest 12-26' Table 12-8. Summary of Program Experiments (1 of 2) Type Experiment Nature of Results Obtained 1. Multiple Launch Successful launch and injection into near synchronous equatorial orbit of up to 8 satellites from one Titan RIC launch vehicle 2. Voice Transmission Duplex links carrying up to twelve 4 kHz voice channels at Defense Communication System tactical quality 3. Wideband Data Simplex links to 1 Mbps using Multiple Frequency Shift Keying for the Transmission transmission of high resolution imagery Duplex links using Phase Shift Keying for the transmission of high data rate digitized voice traffic, providing secure, high quality voice com­ munications 4. Communications to Mobile Duplex data links to ships (AN/SSC-3) and aircraft, (Wright Patterson Terminals Experimental Terminal), 75 bps to 2400 bps, ship to shore and air to ground 5. Interference and Jamming With a psendonoise spread spectrum modulator/demodulator it was demonstrated that duplex communications could be"}
