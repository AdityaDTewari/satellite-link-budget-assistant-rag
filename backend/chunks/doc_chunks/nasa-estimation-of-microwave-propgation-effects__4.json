Thefrequency range treated inthis report isfrom 1to300GHz (30cmto1amwavelengths). Thegaseous attenuation model spans this range although caution should beexercised initsuseatfrequencies above 200GHzduetotheoretical uncertainties inthewater vapor model.

The first ofthese,signal strength atten- uation due toatmospheric absorption, isoffundamental concerninsystem frequency selection, design andoperation due tothestrong frequency dependence produced bymolecular absorption lines atfrequencies above 20GHz. Atmospheric absorption must bedealt with continuously, whereas the attenuation due torain, cloudsandfog, etc. must betreatedstatis- ticallyonapercent oftime basis. The gaseous specific attenuation (dB/km) ispredictable foragivensetoflayer parameters, e.g. sea level pressure, temperature andhumidity.
