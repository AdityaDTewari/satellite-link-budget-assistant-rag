The linear polarized SHF feeds employed at all three sites were compatible with the satellite'sotransmit and receive polarization. This polarization selection made polarization tracking necessary. For VHF communications, the T&C antenna was normally configured for circular polarization. With the linear polarization employed on the satellite, this resulted in 3-dB uplink and downlink polarization losses. 13-11 i Table 13-10.
