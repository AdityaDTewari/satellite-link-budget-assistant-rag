Frequency hopping was first considered on Project West Ford and wasof-interest as a means'to combat jamming in military systems, resist radio frequencj interference, and allow common occupancy of the same frequency/time spectrum b users having low duty cycle random require­ ments for service. Error correcting\"sequential decoding of convolutionally encoded messages was also shown to be a powerful means for improving performance in digital systems operating at low signal-to-noise, ratios. By mid-1966, the initial'interests of the,mid-1960s in operational'systems and advanced techiology and technkiues were supplemented by'an interest in new applica­ tions. Up to this time, satellite commuunications 'had been looked upon, principally, as just another means of providing the kind of commumication services commonly available in the military and commercial long-haul telecommunications networks (i. e., analog voice, TTY, low resolution facsimile, and television). It now began to be apparent that powers and bandwidths were available to support wideband digital traffic such as might be produced by high resolution facsimile and computer-to­ computer applications. Additionally the-high satellite, EIRP made available by advanced TWTs and earth coverage pencil beams made it possible to provide communi­ cations and position location for small aircraft, shipborne, remote data platform; and mobile land terminals. Between mid-1966 and late.1968, the Intelsat-and Molniya operational.systems continued to evolve, and the.military IDCSP system was placed into operation. During this same period, a.,significant portion of the UHF LES testing was conducted, and the ATS program was initiated-to investigate new technology; techniques, and applications. . . In early 1967, the first successful launching of asecond generation of Intelsat spacecraft was accomplished.. By late .1967, three Intelsat Is had been successfully 1-17 launched, and commercial communications service was being provided over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
