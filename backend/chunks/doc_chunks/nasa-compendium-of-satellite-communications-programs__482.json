The satellite antenna pattern was designed for coverage from the United Kingdom in the West to Singapore in the East. The U.K. Is other areas of interest fall between these two extremes. Traffic requirements were telegraphy, speech, and medium speed data circuits. It was decided that the strategic system would be designed specifically for digital signals at rates of 75 x 2n bits per second (where n equals 1, 2, 4, or 5), and would use the 20-MHz channel. Once the digital philosophy was adopted, a telegraph time 15-5 division multiplex was developed, capable of assembling synchronous and nonsyn­ chronous telegraph signals into a single synchronous data stream. For the 20-MHz channel, Pseudo-Noise Spread Spectrum Multiple Access (PN/ SSMA) was chosen over FDMA, which eliminated the need for frequency planning. Additional advantages of this choice were: (1) PN/SSMA signals are virtually im.­ mune to intermodulation effects except for the small loss of useful power, and (2) inherent interference protection is provided. Figure 15-1(2)(10 ) indicates the PN/SSMA links established among the fixed terminals operated in the 20-MHz channel. Table 15-4(2) summarizes the typical link performance in the 20-MHz band. In the mobile terminal case, it was decided to use FDMA in the 2-MHz satel­ lite band. In addition, the 2-MHz channel was to be used to provide engineering tele­ type orderwire facilities between fixed stations. Figure 15-2(2) indicates the FM links to be established in the 2-MHz band. Link power limitations dictate that the mobile and shipborne terminals communicate only with a 12-meter (40-foot) station. Table 15-5 (5)( 6)(9)gives the FM performance characteristics of the demodulators used by the mobile and shipborne terminals. Since communications reliability is of paramount importance, adequate link margins were allowed for unpredictable losses due to weather,"}
