This can be accomplished by having the earth stations transmit their information in bursts rather than continu­ ously as in FDMA, and by synchronizing these bursts so that they enter the transponder in a nonoverlapping sequence. Such a system is called time-division multiple-access (TDMA). INTELSAT's interest in TDMA started in the early stages of commercial satellite communications in 1964, and in 1965 work was initiated on the MATE pro­ gram. This 3-terminal system operated at 6 Mbps and had a preassigned capacity of 72 channels. The field testing of MATE, the first TDMA system to be so tested, was conducted via INTELSAT I in August 1966. The tests clearly demonstrated the feasibility of TDMA and indicated that burst synchronization to accuracies in the low nanosecond region could be achieved if such accuracy were required. Both the initial FDMA and TDMA systems employed fixed preassigned allocations of satellite transponder time, frequency, and power. Unfortunately, the preassigned 10-50 approaches to multiple access, while providing excellent quality and service, have a poor working flexibility and use satellite spectrum and power inefficiently by provid­ ing a poor \"fill factor. \" Fill factor can be viewed as the relationship of the total voice channel capacity of a satellite transponder to the average number of such channels actively employed during the busy period. When fixed assignments are made, there are numerous instances where channels stand inactive. Recognizing the need for more efficient systems, INTELSAT began to consider demand access approaches to multiple utilization of the same satellite transponder. In demand access, the general concept is to assign nonoverlapping allocations of satellite power and thne-frequency spectrum to users, in real time, as their demand for service"}
