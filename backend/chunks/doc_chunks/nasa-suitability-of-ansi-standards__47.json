The following discussion identifies and roughly estimates some oftheuser's influence onsystem performance forthe four ancillary performance parameters. User Fraction ofAccess Time The User Fraction ofAccess Time fortheACTS LBR system isthetime it takes the originating user toinput the destination address information 561989010985-066 (i.e., \"dial thenumber\") and destination user toanswer. This can take a significant amount oftime astheACTS LBRsystem uses a\"four-way handshake\" protocol toestablish acircuit. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, this parameter would besmall andAccess Time would bedominated bythe ACTS LBR system. Iftheusers arehuman operators with telephones, theUser Fraction ofAccess Time would bethedominant portion ofAccess Time. User Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, theuser information blocks areready fortransfer; thus, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time would bevery small. Ifthey arehuman operators, andtheuser information blocks areassembled attheuser's terminal, theblock assembly depends onthe operator's typing speed. 'f_'_s, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time can become asignificant part oftheoverall Block Transfer Time. User Fraction ofinput/Output Time With computers transferring files, this parameter would besmall. IIowever, with human operators, typing andreading speed would dominate theinput/output time. User Fraction ofDisengagement Time Once auser hasissued adisconnect request,theACTS \"BRsystem processes the request and disengages the circuit. The only user dependency ishow quickly thedisengagement request isentered into thesyste:a. Table 5identifies the system performance parameters applicable _or quantifying the ACTS LBR system performance. Theparameters not deemed applicable describe relatively rare system performance outcomes, andtypically require long observation periods andmore elaborate measurement equipment to gather enough data toesti_nate kh_parameter with high confidence. [nmany cases theeffects ofthese rareevents alsoaffect common system perform_mce outcomes, e.g.,BitError Probability, andarethusalready accounted for. This isnottoimply that: only theparameters identified areuseful for quantifying system performance.
