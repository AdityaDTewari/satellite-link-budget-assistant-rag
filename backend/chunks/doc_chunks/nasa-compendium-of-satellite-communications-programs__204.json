The crbssbd dipole and crossed slot aircraft antennas were circularly polarized. 9.3.5 Experiments . . : A multitude of snfall mobile terminals were available for test operations and innumerable measurements, demonstrations, and tests of a wide variety were conducted over the UHF Lincoln Experimental Satellites. Demonstrations even included support of Apollo 9's-splashdown by LES-6.
