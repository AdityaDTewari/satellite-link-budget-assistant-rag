These stations are also designed for unattended operation and are equipped with a supervisory system. The NTC stations are equipped with a 10.2-meter (33.3-foot) diameter antenna which, in conjunction with an uncooled low noise parametric amplifier, provides a G/T of 28 dB/0 K. The antennas are non-tracking, but may be steered by means of a remote drive control over a limited range, should they have to be adjusted to a new satellite orbital position. Each station is equipped with redundant transmit and receive chains. A photograph of the station at Resolute is shown in Figure 18-16. Block diagrams of the two NTC stations are given in Figures 18-17 and 18-18. 18.4.4 The Remote Television (RTV) Stations These are unattended stations engineered to provide for the reception of television signals in remote communities which are usually equipped with a low power television transmitter providing limited coverage of the surrounding area. The 25 RTV stations provide the means of making available to remote centers the same television program­ ming as is available in the larger population centers. The majority of the stations are provided with a single non-redundant receive chain, however, some are equipped with two receive chains to provide for the simul­ taneous reception of two television channels. 18-32 0 0 AUDIO Wo x SELECTOR LOLAD S Z 0 U I I-STANDBY CHAIN­ (RIVIERE R2UGAE ONLY) TC (TEST COUPLING) z0 UU z-W- CO VIDEO AUDIO 03 CUE CONTROI ~ W m0 -- i--e DE F / Rx No3 Rx NO4 tSAIND LN, M I Figure 18-15.
