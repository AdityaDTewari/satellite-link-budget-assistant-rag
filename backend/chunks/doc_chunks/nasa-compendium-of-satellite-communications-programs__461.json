The modulating signal was a pseudorandom binary bit stream that could be used at the ground stations for synchronization or timing functions. In addition, the beacon frequency was used as a reference frequency for all tactical ground terminals. The satellite UHF receiver processed the received RF signal, which varied in level from -150 to -105 dBW. The signal was split into two channels, one for narrow­ band and the other for wideband operation. The wideband channel was downconverted to a band"}
