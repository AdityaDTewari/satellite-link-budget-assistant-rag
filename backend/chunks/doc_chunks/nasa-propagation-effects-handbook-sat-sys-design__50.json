Twofactors intheempirical method accountfortheradio path averaging effect. First, themethod isbased uponthelong term distribution of5-minute pointrain rates inwhich theS-minute time averagingpartially accounts forthefact that theradio pathperformsaspatialaveraging of non-uniform rain rates (Freeny andGabbe-1969, DrufucaandZawadzki-1973, Bussey-lg50). A5-minute average oftherain rate seenatapoint corresponds tospatially averaging approximately 2.1kmofvertically variable rain rates, assuming 7meters/second average descent velocity ofrain drops. Figure3.5-2showshowthepoint rain rate distribution, from two years ofmeasurements atPalmetto, Georgia, dependsontheaverage time intervals (range: 0.5-60 minutes). Theprobability ofa5-minute rain rate exceeding the40mm/h threshold isI/2that ofaO.5-minute rain rate exceeding thesame threshold. Fromanother viewpoint, increasing the averaging time interval from 0.5to5minutes reduces theO.Ol percentile (i.e., 53minutes/year) rain rate from 87to58mm/h. 83 N z 0 z W 0 W n- U-s.- u s-o\" la_ oo *r- _r- 00 ! r_ c_ 84 However,since most radio paths ofinterest arelonger than 2.ikm, thefixed 5-minute average interval cannot adequately account forallthepath length variations. This deficiency iscompensated forbythefactor [I+(3.5-4) Inother words, theauxiliary nonlinear factor represents theempirical ratio between the5-minute point rain rate Randtheradio path average rain rate Rav(L) atthesame probability level. Since thesignificant difference between the5-minute point rain rate andtheO.5-minute point rain rate in Figure 3.5-2 already accounts forthemajor portion ofthedifference between theradio path average rain rate Rav(L )andtheO.5-minute point rain rate, theauxiliary factor isaweak nonlinear function ofL.Obviously, many different analytic functions canbeused toapproximate thismildly nonlinear behavior.Thesingleparameter function isselected foritssimplicity. The adequacy ofthis simple approximation issupportedbytherain rate andrain attenuation datameasured onnine, ll-GHz, terrestrial radio paths atfive U.S. locations (Lin-1977). 3.5.3 Earth-Satellite Path Length Toextend themethod toearth-satellite paths, letHbethelong-term average height ofthefreezing level intheatmosphere,"}
