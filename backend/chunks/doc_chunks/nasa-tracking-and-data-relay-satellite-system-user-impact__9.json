This condition holds for the 1 watt user RF power originally specified. It is further seen that, given the capability to generate 5 watts of RF power, the user's antenna gain requirements are significantly reduced in that the same data rate performance can be achieved by much more modest antennas with gains of between -4 and 6 dB. In order to obtain the specified forward link data rates of 100 bps to 1024 bps, Figure 2.3 shows that the user antenna gains should be between 6 and 16 dB. For the lower part of this range of say 100-200 bps, the 6 -9 dB of antenna gain required is shown in Section 4 to be achievable with modest antennas such as spirals of helices. Howeverc, above 200bps. the antenaa gain requirements on the user become more difficult to achieve with simple antennas. Two methods of easing the user's antenna gain requirements on the forward link are an increase in TDRS EIRP and a decrease in the user's receiving system noise temperature. With respect to the latter, the current Hughes baseline for the TDRS itself employs bipolar silicon tran- sistors which provide a system noise temperature of 540 K. A reduction in the user's effective noise temperature to this value from the currently estimated 1500 K produces a decrease in antenna gain of almost 4.5 dB. Thus, it is believed that some combination of increased TDRS EIRP and reduced user noise temperature is needed to permit the use of relatively modest user antennas to achieve the full range of specified forward link rates. 2-7 2.4 Analysis Summary Calculations are performed in Section 3 in which visibility time, expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period, is determined as a function of the beamwidth of the user antenna."}
