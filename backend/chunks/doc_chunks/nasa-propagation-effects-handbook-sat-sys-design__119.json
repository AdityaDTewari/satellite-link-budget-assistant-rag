Experimental fade duration statistics arepresented inChapter 5 (Section 5.6). Asmentioned inthat section, experimental data hasconfirmed that theduration ofafade greater than agiven threshold tends tohave a log-normal probability distribution. This isequivalent tothelogarithm of theduration having anormal distribution. Given sufficient experimental data, onemaydetermine theparameters ofthebest-fitting log-normal distribution, andusethese toextrapolate from theempirical distribution. Such extrapolation could beused inlieu of,orinaddition to,thetechnique described here when fade duration data isavailable. 233 RAINRATE(mm/hr) 10 20 30 40 50 60 iIII.II 21 TE CT JULYTHRUDEC/74 MINUTELY AVERAGES RI_SM_I, N.C. t.__MEASURED ATTENUATION TESTOTAL RAINRATEDURING ATTENUATION \"_D_/MEASUREMENTS PREDICTED _ -ATTENUATION I:_ BYDISTRIBUTION _ EXTENSION _.

TheUSand Canadian weather services have published maximum rainfall intensity (rain rate) -duration -frequency curves which provide thepoint rain rates for several hundred locations ontheNorth American continent (U.S. Dept. Comm.- 1955 andCanada Atmos. Env.-1973). Twotypical setsofcurves forthe close-proximity cities ofBaltimore, MDandWashington, D.C. areshown in Figure 6.3-11. Thereturn periods arecomputed usingtheanalysis ofGumbel (1958) since data isnotalways available forthelO0-year return period. These curves arederived from thesingle maximum rain-rate event inagiven year andaretermed theannual series. Formicrowave propagation studies, curves that consider allhigh rain rate events arenecessary. Such curves, called thepartial-duration series, arenotnormally available, butempirical multipliers have beenfound foradjusting theannual series curves to approximate thepartial-duration series(Dept. Commerce-1955). Toobtain the partial-duration curve, therain rates ontheannual series curve forthe desired return period aremultiplied bytheappropriate factors, given in Table 6.3-3. Theintensity-duration-frequency curves actually give theaverage rain rate over theduration period, whereas theinstantaneous rain rate isof interest from apropagation standpoint. Thecurves therefore donotdirectly give thefrequency versus duration offades"}
