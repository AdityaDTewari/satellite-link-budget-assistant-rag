Itdiffers from most other rainmodels in that itisbased entirely onmetecological observations, notattenuation measurements. Therain model, combined with theattenuation estimation, was tested bycomparison with attenuation measurements.

TheGlobal Prediction Model provides median distribution estimates forbroad geographical regions; eight climate regions Athrough Haredesignated toclassify regions covering theentire globe. Figures 3.4-I and3.4-2 show thegeographic rain climate regions forthecontinental andocean areas oftheearth. TheUnited States andEuropean portions arefurther expanded inFigures 3.4-3 and3.4-4 respectively. Theclimate regions depictedbytheGlobal Model arevery broad. The upper andlower rain rate bounds provided bythenearest adjacent region have aratio of3.5atO.Ol percent oftheyear fortheproposed CCIR climate region D,forexample, producing anattendant ratio ofupper-to-lower bound attenuation values of4.3dBat12GHz. This uncertainty intheestimated attenuation value canbereduced byusing rain rate distributions tailored to aparticular area iflong term statisticsareavailable. Using the subdivision ofclimate regions BandDinthecontinental United States, Canada, andEurope also helps toreduce theuncertainty intheestimates.
