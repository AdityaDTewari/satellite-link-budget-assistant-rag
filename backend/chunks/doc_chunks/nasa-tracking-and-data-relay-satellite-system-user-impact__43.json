This antenna provides a gain greater than -6 dB over an angle of 140 degrees centered on the spacecraft forward spin axis. Figure 4.16 shows the configuration of the conical log spiral antenna and its corresponding radiation pattern. This particular antenna, which weighs approximately 1 kg, is most often used as a radiator for broadband frequency coverage, not necessarily a major requirement with TDRS usage. 4-39 FIBERGLASS CONE RIBBON CONDUCTOR MOUNTING PLATE/ GROUND PLANE CONICAL LOG TYPICAL 0-PLANE RADIATIONSPIRAL RADIATOR PATTERN Figure 4,16..

The weights and dimensions were originally developed for VHF and UHF and scaled to S-band. Where available, antenna radiation patterns are also given. The antennas described in this section include: Unfurlable turnstile Conical spiral above a ground plane Slotted dipole cone Stripline turnstile Cavity fed slot dipole Discone Cup dipole Circular dipole array Linear dipole array Dipole planar array Disc-on-rod endfire Prime focus reflector 4-41 FIGURE 4.17.
