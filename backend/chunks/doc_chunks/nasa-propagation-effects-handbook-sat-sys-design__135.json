Theseparationdistance required toachieve a given levelofdiversity gain increases asthepath elevation angle decreases (Hodge-1978). Thisisduetotheincreased likelihood ofpath intersections with rain cells atlower elevation angles. This effect iscoupled tothe problem ofrain cell anisotropy andpath azimuth asnotedbelow. Stated differently, thediversitygain decreases with decreasingelevation angle (Allnutt-1978). 6.5.4.4Path Azimuth Angle. Forsynchronoussatellites thepath azimuth and elevation angles arenotindependent, and, thus, thedependenceofdiversity performance onthese variables cannot befully separated. Ifallrain cells were isotropic, onewould expect novariation indiversity performance with azimuth angle otherthan that associated with theelevation angles. However, when rain cell anisotropy isconsidered, there appears tobeaweak improvement indiversity performance forpath azimuths inthesoutherly compass _adrant (inthenorthern hemisphere) that doesnotcontain the preferred axis ofrain cell orientation.!/ 264 ............ \"....................... • L I6.5.4.5Link Frequency.
