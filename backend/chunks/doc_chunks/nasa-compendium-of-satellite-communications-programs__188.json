S. global experimental military communication satellite system. DATS 1 was electrically identical to the rDCSP satellites but employed an experi­ mental electronically despun antenna. DODGE was intended to study a number of advanced gravity-gradient stabilization techniques at near-synchronous attitudes and to take color TV pictures. - LES-5 and the ground complex employed with it provided-experiments aimed at meeting all of the objectives listed in Table 9-10 with the exception of Items 5, 6 and 8(21) The satellite was utilized, during its 3-year.(approkimate) active lifetime, by tactical terminals of all the U. S'armed services and NATO forces. In-general, the experiments conducted allowed all of the intended objectives to be accomplished. These successes were attained in spite of a number of minor spacecraft. failures. Difficulties included predictable daily periods of abnormally high rate receiver timing signals to the command system and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) Experiment, predictable yearly periods of reduced receiver sensitivity, failure of one of four sun sensors providing inputs to the automatic attitude control system, and a 1. 7 kHz frequency shift in one of two transpondet local oscillators resulting in a correspond­ ing change in frequency translation. LES-6, OV2-5, OV5-2, and OV5-4 were successfully launched into planned orbits by Titan 1I1-C Vehicle No. 5(21) (27) The launch vehicleIs Transtage left LES-6 in an essentially synchronous equatorial orbit. The satellite's onboard cold ammonia thruster system was used for final adjustment'intoa Istationary orbit with the spacecraft positioned at about 860 West -longitude(2 8 ).
