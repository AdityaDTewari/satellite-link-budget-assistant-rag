Both of these satellites and F-3, which supplemented Early Bird in the Atlantic area by pro­ viding wide area service, have operated satisfactorily providing commercial com­ munications service. Multiple-access service was successfully initiated with the INTELSAT II satellite (F-2) on January 27, 1969. The first INTELSAT III satellite (F-1) was launched in 'September 1968, but no orbit was achieved. This was followed by the launch of INTELSAT III F-2 on December 18, 1968. This satellite began operational service over the Atlantic on December 24, 1968. It operated satisfactorily until June of 1969, at which time sticking of the mechanically despin antenna was encountered. This was determined to be due to a thermal gradient problem across the bearings of the despin motor. By August of 1969, the satellite was back in operatioial service. It continued to be em­ ployed until February 1, 1970, when INTELSAT I F-6 assumed the operational load over the Atlantic Ocean and F-2 was retired from service. INTELSAT III F-3 was launched into orbit over the Pacific on February 5, 1969. It was placed into opera­ tional service on February 16, 1969, and continued to be employed in the Pacific loca­ tion for about 6 months. F-3 was then repositioned over the Indian Ocean after losing about 6 dB of transponder gain due to a malfunction in one stage of the receiver tunnel diode amplifier. The reduced channel loading associated with operations at the Indian 10-56 Ocean location permitted the satellite to continue in a useful capacity. -INTELSAT III F-4 replaced F-3 in handling the Pacific Ocean operational traffic. INTELSAT III F-7 was successfully placed into service over the Atlantic on May 8, 1970 to supple­ ment F-6. As of mid-1971 INTELSAT III F-3, F-4, F-6, and"}
