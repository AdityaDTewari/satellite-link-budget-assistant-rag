It is seen that for the return link performance specified by the Statement of Work for the Study, the data rate requirements of 1 -10 kilobits per second can be satisfied by user antenna gains of between 3 and 13 dB. This condition holds for the 1 watt user RF power originally specified. It is further seen that, given the capability to generate 5 watts of RF power, the user's antenna gain requirements are significantly reduced in that the same data rate performance can be achieved by much"}
