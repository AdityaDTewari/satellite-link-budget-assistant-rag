Equation ( 79) is based on the same theoretical formulation as the prediction method of § 4.1, and can be used to scale XPD data that include the effects of both rain and ice depolarization, since it has been observed that both phenomena have approximately the same frequency dependence at frequencies less than about 30 GHz. 4.4 Data relevant to cross -polarization cancellation Experiments have shown that a strong correlation exists between rain depolarization at 6 and 4 GHz on Earth -space paths, both on the long term and on an event basis, and uplink depolarization compensation utilizing concurrent down -link depolarization measu rements appears feasible. Only differential phase effects were apparent, even for severe rain events, and single -parameter compensation (i.e. for differential phase) appears sufficient at 6 and 4 GHz. Measurements at 6 and 4 GHz have also shown that 99% of the XPD variations are slower than  4 dB/s, or equivalently, less than  1.5°/s in the mean path differential phase shift. Therefore, the time constant of a depolarization compensation system at these frequencies need only be about 1 s. 5 Propagation delays Radiometeorologically -based methods for estimating the average propagation delay or range error, and the corresponding variations, for Earth -space paths through the troposphere are available in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. The delay variance is required for satellite ranging and synchronization in digital satellite communication systems. At frequencies above 10 GHz, the ionospheric time delay (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) is generally smaller than that for the troposphere, but may have to be considered in special cases. Range determination to centimetre accuracy requires careful consideration of the various contributions to excess range delay. The water"}
