However, at low elevation angles where the short period signal fluctuations due to tropospheric scintillation become statistically significant, there are some cas es for which the exceedance time during available time is far larger than in the case at higher elevation Earth -space paths. 2.2.5.2 Rates of change of attenuation (fading rate) There is broad agreement that the distributions of positive and negative fade rates are log -normally distributed and very similar to each other. The dependence of fade rate on fade depth has not been established. 2.2.5.3 Correlation of instantaneous values of attenuation at different frequencies Data on the instantaneous ratio of rain attenuation values at different frequencies are of interest for a variety of adaptive fade techniques. The frequency -scaling ratio has been found to be log -normally distributed, and is influenced by rain type and rai n temperature. Data reveal that the short -term variations in the attenuation ratio can be significant, and are expected to increase with decreasing path elevation angle. 2.3 Clear -air effects Other than atmospheric absorption, clear -air effects in the absence of precipitation are unlikely to produce serious fading in space telecommunication systems operating at frequencies below about 10 GHz and at elevation angles above 10°. At low elevation a ngles (  10°) and at frequencies above about 10 GHz, however, tropospheric scintillations can on occasion cause serious degradations in performance. At very low elevation angles (  4° on inland paths, and  5° on overwater or coastal paths), fading due to multipath propagation effects can be particularly severe. At some locations, ionospheric scintillation may be important at frequencies below about 6 GHz (see Recommendation ITU-R P.531). 2.3.1 Decrease in antenna gain due to"}
