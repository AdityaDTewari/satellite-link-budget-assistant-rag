The least -squares fit can be determined using the step - by-step procedure to approximate a complementary cumulative distribution by a log -normal complementary cumulative distribution described in Recommendation ITU -R P.1057. 2.2.4.2 Diversity gain While the prediction method described in § 2.2.4.1 is preferred, an alternate simplified method to predict the diversity gain, G (dB), between pairs of sites can be calculated with the empirical expression given below. This alternate method can be used for site separations of less than 20 km. Parameters required for the calculation of diversity gain are: d : separation (km) between the two sites A : path rain attenuation (dB) for a single site f : frequency (GHz)  : path elevation angle (degrees)  : angle (degrees) made by the azimuth of the propagation path with respect to the baseline between sites, chosen such that   90°. Step 1 : Calculate the gain contributed by the spatial separation from: ) (e–1–bdda G= (37) where: a = 0.78 A – 1.94 (1 – e–0.11 A) b = 0.59 (1 – e–0.1 A) Step 2 : Calculate the frequency -dependent gain from: Gf = e–0.025 f (38) Step 3 : Calculate the gain term dependent on elevation angle from: G = 1 + 0.006  (39) Step 4 : Calculate the baseline -dependent term from the expression: G = 1 + 0.002  (40) Step 5 : Compute the net diversity gain as the product: 16 Rec.
