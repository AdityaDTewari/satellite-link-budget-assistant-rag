The step -by-step procedure is as follows: Step 1 : Calculate the apparent boresight elevation angle  (mrad) corresponding to the desired free-space elevation angle 0 (mrad) accounting for the effects of refraction for the path of interest using the method described in § 4 of Recommendation ITU-R P.834. Step 2 : For the path of interest, calculate the geoclimatic factor, Kw, for the average annual worst month: 10 5.10 10LatCC L wp K+  = (50) where pL (%) is the percentage of time that the refractivity gradient in the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere is less than −100 N units/km in that month having the highest value of pL from the four seasonally representative months of February, May, August and November for which maps are given in Figs 8 to 11 of Recommendation ITU-R P.453. As an exception, only the maps for May and August should be used for latitudes greater than 60° N or 60° S. Values of the coefficient C0 in equation ( 50) corresponding to the type of path are summarized in Table 3. The coefficient CLat vs. latitude  (in °N or °S) is given by: CLat = 0 for ||  53° (51) CLat = –53 +  for 53° < ||  60° (52) CLat = 7 for 60° < || (53) TABLE 3 Values of the coefficient C0 in equation (50) for various types of propagation path Type of path C0 Propagation paths entirely over land for which the earth -station antenna is less than 700 m"}
