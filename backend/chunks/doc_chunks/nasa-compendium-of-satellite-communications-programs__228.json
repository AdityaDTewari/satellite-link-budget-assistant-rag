After a period of satellite performance testing, system parameter evaluation using the operating ground stations, terrestrial and satellite circuit lineup, and public demonstrations, commercial operation was initiated' on June 28, 1965. Tle satellite successfully p'rovided commercial com­ muhicatiofls service betweenthe United States and-Europe until it was retired in early 1969. It was\" reactivated for a brief period lateri i 1969 whext temporary difficulties were encountered with the antdnna systemr of a third'generation INTELSAT satellite. The second generation of INTELSAT spacecraft was designated INTELSAT 11. Even when the INTELSAT I system was under development, it was realized that many of the inherent advantages of space communications could not be exploited. Specifi­ cally, its antenna characteristics were such as to embrace only the northeastern part of North America and the western part of Europe, and it did not allow for simultaneous 10-2. Table 10-i.

By late 1965, it was recognized that the constraints imposed by these deficiencies would be incompatible with a NASA requirement for multichannel communications in late 1966 among its tracking stations at Carnarvon, Australia, Ascension Island, Canary Island, tracking ships in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and the Manned Space Flight Center in Houston, Texas. In the past, these circuits had been"}
