To calculate the height above ground, you need to subtract the result from a line drawn directly between the tops of the two towers. r = sqrt( λ*(d1*d2)/(d)) 19 Line of Sight and Fresnel Zones r = sqrt( λ*d1*d2/d) rMAX = 1/2* sqrt( λ*d) where all the dimensions are in meters 20 rMAX d1 d2r Clearance of the Fresnel Zone and earth curvature Distance (km) 1st zone (m) 60% (m) Earth curvature (m) Required height (m) 1 5.5 3.3 0.0 3.9 5 12.4 7.44 0.4 7.84 10 17.5 10.5 1.5 12 15 21.4 12.84 3.3 16.13 20 24.7 15.82 5.9 21.72 25 27.7 16.62 9.2 25.82 30 30.3 18.18 13.3 32.5 This table shows the minimum height above flat ground required to clear 60% of the first Fresnel zone for various link distances at 2.4 GHz. Notice that earth curvature plays a small role at short distances, but becomes more important as the distance increases. 21 Fresnel Zone ‣Considering the importance of the Fresnel Zone, it is important to quantify the degree to which it can be blocked. ‣Typically, 20% - 40% Fresnel Zone blockage introduces little attenuation into the link. ‣It is better to err to the conservative side allowing no more than 20% blockage of the Fresnel Zone. 22 For more details about the topics presented in this lecture, please see the book"}
