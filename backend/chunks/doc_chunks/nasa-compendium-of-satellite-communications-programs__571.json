Telecommunications Services for Bell Canada 18-49 18.6.4 Message Service for COTC One RF channel will be used by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Cor­ poration (COTC) when the CANTAT II trans-Atlantic cable is put into service in 1974. Telesat will provide the link between the western terminal of the cable at Beaver Harbour, which is north of Halifax, Nova Scotia and a COTC switching center in Toronto, using the earth stations at Harrietsfield and Allan Park, respectively (see Figure 18-27). The initial requirement which is for 240 2-way circuits, will be upgraded to 400 circuits in 1975, by the introduction of TDMA techniques. 18. 6,5 DOMSAT Service for U. S. Beginning in July 1974, RCA Globcom/Alascom began using one Telesat trans­ ponder to link earth stations in the Washington-New York corridor, the San Francisco area, and Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska. For more details, see Section 20. 18.7 EXPERIMENTS The Telesat program has included several experimental activities, including a TDMA Study Program. This study was initiated in the summer of 1971. Although re­ sults of theoretical analysis indicated that the TDMA system design could be imple­ mented, there remained two major areas which needed experimental verification--the first being the effect of adjacent channel interference, and the second, the in-band digital performance of the TDMA channel. The first question was associated with the effect of the TDMA signal on its adjacent transponders which may carry a variety of signals. This type of interference is due primarily to energy spreading of the TDMA signal caused by satellite TWT nonlinearities, and post TWT filters. In this case, Telesat was concerned with the"}
