Programs will be transmitted 4 hours a day for 1 year from the primary Indian ground station in Ahmedabad or the secondary station in Delhi to ATS-6 for relay to villages and cities throughout India. 13-106 Because 'of the large number of languages and dialects spoken in India, the video channel will be accompanied by two audio channels in different languages. Daily programs will stress improved agricultural techniques, 'family planning and hygiene, school instruction and teacher education, and occupational skills. Children's programs will be shown from 10:00 to 11:30 -a.m. while general broadcast materials and adult education programs will be transmitted from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m., Indian local times. The basic ground terminal costs about $600 and consists of a 37meter (10-foot) diameter antenna made of expanded alumninum mesh, a converter, and a TV receiver. About 2,400 of these terminals will be located in six clusters of 400 in various parts of India for direct reception from the ATS-F. Another 2,600 or more standard TV receivers will be located near, rediffusion transmitting stations where the signals relayed through the ATS-6 will be retrans­ mitted over conventional TV for the benefit of people in villages near'the larger cities. (42) The experiments will operate on these frequencies: * C-band for ground to-ATS-6-to ground, 6 GHz up and 4 GHz down with bandwidth of 40 MHz. * UHF from ATS-6 to ground TV receiving terminals, 860 MHz. SITE will transmit two audio channels simultaneously with the video. The two FM audio signals will use separate subcarriers at 5.5 MHz and 6.0 MHz. The video (625 lines CCIR system B) and audiosubearriers are summed at baseband, and"}
