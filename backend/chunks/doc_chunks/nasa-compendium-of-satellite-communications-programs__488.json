Three redundant antenna pointing control systems are provided -earth horizon sensors, sun angle sensors, and a backup earth-to-satellite, command link. A UHF subsystem, also redundant, is provided for telemetry tracking and command serv­ ices (TT&C). Figure 15-4(12) is a'sketch of the SKYNET II spacecraft. Figure 15-5 (1 3 ) shows a block diagram of the SKYNET II spacecraft subsystem and communications subsys­ tem. Although the SKYNET II satellite is similar in design to SKYNET I, it is larger and heavier, satellite power has been increased, the design life has been extended 15-15 Forward shield assembly S-Band antennaassembly- Eqiment • Aft ABM shield Solar panels Aft shield Figure 15-4.
