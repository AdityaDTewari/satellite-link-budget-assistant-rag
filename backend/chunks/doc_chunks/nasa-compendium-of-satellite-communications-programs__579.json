To meet these objectives the United States and Canada have agreed to initiate experimental programs designed to illustrate the adaptability of satellite systems to the distribution of information to sparsely settled areas. The programs are to be im­ plemented by various independent experimenters who have designed experiments in two categories; those which advance space systems technology and those which demonstrate 19-1 the suitability of space systems to the solution of social problems. The actual experi­ ments planned are discussed in Section 19-4. Current plans postulate that the CTS will be launched into geostationary orbit in January 1976 by a Delta 2914 vehicle. The orbit envisioned for CTS is 1160 W lon­ gitude with a variation in East-West position not to exceed ±0.2 degrees over the two year lifetime. The launch window will be selected to provide an inclination less than one degree for satellite life with the inclination remaining below 0. 65 degree as long as possible. During its operational life the CTS spacecraft will demonstrate several subsys­ tems which constitute advances in the state-of-the-art of satellite communications. The most significant advance expected is the development of a high efficiency, 12 GHz, 200 watt TWT. Successful flight qualification of such a tube will measurably enhance current TWT technology and provide a solid basis for future high power satellite sys­ tems. Two expected spacecraft systems applications advances are the use of an accu­ rate three-axis stabilization on a spacecraft with flexible appendages and the use of an extendable solar array with greater than 1 kilowatt power output. Each of these innovations represents significant application of current technology. The ground segment of the CTS project also represents a significant application of current technology.
