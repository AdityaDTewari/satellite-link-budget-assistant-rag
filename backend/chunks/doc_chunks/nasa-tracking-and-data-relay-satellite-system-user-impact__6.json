The communication links from the ground station to the user are defined as forward links, while the links from the user spacecraft to the ground station are defined as return links. Although the overall system concept embraces three categories of user, that is, high, medium, and low data rate types, the category exclusively dealt with in this study is the low data rate (LDR) type. For this service both the forward and return links are implemented with broad coverage (26 degree field of view) antennas aboard the TDRS. To put this report into proper perspective, it is of value to discuss the characteristics of two major interacting constituents of the system: the TDRS itself and the user satellites. *Although the nomenclature for this service has been recently changed to the Multi-Access Service (MAS), the term LDR will be used throughout the remainder of this report. 2-1 0 .:: :;:\" U GROUND STATION C USER .. ..

TDRS System Concept 2-2 2.2 User and TDRS Characteristics The LDR links between a TDRS and user spacecraft employ broad coverage TDRS antennas, accommodating user spacecraft with orbital alti- tudes up to 3300 km. Examination of the NASA '78, '79, and '80 Mission Models in Appendix A* shows the majority of users to be orbiting at 300 to 1000 km, which is well within the range of the field of view of the TDRS antennas. To give some idea of the distribution of the users, Figure 2.2 shows a mission model summary derived from Appendix A, in the form of a density profile."}
