Frequency control is the same as in the Type I and II terminals. 15.4.3 Type V Shipborne Terminal Figure 15-8 (9 ) illustrates the essentials for the Type V terminal. Information signals to be transmitted by the terminal are passed through the baseband equipment to the exciter, which produces a low power microwave carrier modulated by the baseband signal. The microwave signal is amplified to a level of a few kilowatts and fed to the waveguide system and the antenna. The waveguide system contains the necessary filter and diplexers for separat­ ing received from transmitted signals. It also contains a monopulse comparator for deriving angular misalignment signals which are fed to,,the tracking receiver. Re­ ceived communications signals are first amplified in a low-noise preamplifier and then demodulated in the receivers after being down-converted to a suitable inter mediate frequency and filtered to select the wanted carriers. The receivers feed the baseband equipment with outputs to the user equipment (telephone; telegraph, etc.). Stabilization of the antenna beam is by reference to the gyro assembly, Which provides an inertial reference pointing angle. Any misalignment of the beam with respect to this reference is sensed by the gyro pickoffs, and corrections are applied by power servo and.drive motors. The inertial reference point angle is updated by signals derived from the tracking receiver so that the beam always points at the satellite. Manual pointing data for initially acquiring the satellite may also be fed to the gyro assembly. A terminal located on a ship has a three-axis mount since pitching and rolling motions make a"}
