Table 14-10 presents the major technical ex­ periments together with the salient results obtained. The operational experiments, conducted by the Navy, were termed a Fleet Operational Investigation (FOI) and were intended to investigate tactical concepts, operating procedures, and techniques. These overlapped, to some degree, technical experiments but were intended to determine effects of operationally imposed factors. The followiiig categories of operational experiments were established: 1. Multiple-access capability 2. Operational techniques and procedures 3. Environmental influences on operational characteristics 4. Special purpose operational applications The specific experiments were of three types: teletype, voice, and simul­ taneous voice and teletype 14-14 Table 14-8.
