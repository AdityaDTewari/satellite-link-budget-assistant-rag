Additional LES-6 difficulties included intermodu­ lation between the beacon and communications transmitters and the shutter, covering the radiation experiment, operating intermittently. The former was the same problem as experienced on LES-5 and it too disappeared after a.brief time of in-orbit opera­ tion. The latter was caused by variations in the dc power level and the lack-of a power regulator on this spacecraft. 9\".48 CITED REFERENCES 1. H. Sherman, D. C. MadLellan, R. N.\"Lerner, and P.
