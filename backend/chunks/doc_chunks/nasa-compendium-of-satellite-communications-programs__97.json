In both the record and playback modes,, delayed repeater operation required 6-second lags before initiating signal transfers to allow tape recorders to reach operational speed. In addition to the tests listed in Table 4-8, Courier Ibwas employed in radar range measurement experiments. (7). These experiments contributed the development of techniques for employing ranging data to develop satellite tracking information. 4.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Project Courier was an experimental program; therefore, no operational traffic was carried.' Satellite operational results during the 17-day lifetime of Courier lb were described in the discussion.of experiments (Paragraph 4.,5). Ground terminal tracking reliability and-accuracy were quite good. Communications equipment performance and.reliability was easily adequate for the limited duration 4-10 Table 4-8. Communications Performance .Experiments Type Experiment .t Nature of Results Obtained 1. Received Signal VHF and UHF uplink and downlink levels,- in general, Level appeared to agree with expectations with level variations for most part due to Faraday rotation, satellite spin and changes in spin axis, aspect to,earth. * 2. Teletype Delayed repeater and real time performance was the same. Average, corrected error rate* was 3.33 x 10-4 bits per bit. 3. Voice Delayed repeater and real time performance appeared the same. Single channel voice subjectively evaluated to be of commercial' quality. Estimated that iour or more multiplexed voice could have reasonably been accommodated. 4. Facsimile Real time performance subjectively evaluated as excellent. Some synchronization difficulties encountered in delayed repeater operation due inadequate speed stability of tape recorders.*** • Exact real time effects of spin rate and spin axis aspect were difficult to ascertain since satellite did not incorporate sensors for their measurement. However, fades did not correlate with atmospheric disturbances that affect more conventional types of long distance radio propagation such as"}
