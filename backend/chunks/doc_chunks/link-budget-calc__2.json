Therefore, clearance of optical LOS does not guarantee the clearance of RADIO LOS . Line of Sight and Fresnel Zones a free line-of-sight IS NOT EQUAL TO a free Fresnel Zone 18 r Fresnel Zone ‣The radius of the first Fresnel Zone at a given point between the transmitter and the receiver can be calculated as: ‣ ...where r is the radius of the zone in meters, d1 and d2 are distances from the obstacle to the link end points in meters, d is the total link distance"}
