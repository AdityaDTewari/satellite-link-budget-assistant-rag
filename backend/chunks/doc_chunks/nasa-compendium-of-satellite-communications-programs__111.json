If the time and frequency behavior of a dispersive medium is sufficiently well-behaved, the two parameters B and L are an-adequate description for the purpose of signal design. A more complete description of the dipole belt is furnished by the so-called scatterinM function of the medium. This is a function q of the two variables, time 'r and frequency f, and designates the scattering cross-section of the medium at propaga­ tion delay r and doppler shift f. The spattering function of a dispersive channel, together with the spectrum of the additive noise component, constitutes a model of the channel that is sufficiently detailed to allow synthesis of optimum signals and detect­"}
