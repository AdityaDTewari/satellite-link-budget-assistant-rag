As each component is added to the design area, the user can pick from a list of commercially available components from a database that the database automatically retrieves as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. List is pulled from a database The database stores all relevant information for each component such as mass, power, operating tem- perature range, and dimensions as seen in the middle panel in Figure 3. When someone right clicks ontothe component, it gives the user options to delete, edit, or view the component’s information, also shown inFigure 4. The database skeleton was set up and populated with a few example components as shown in Figure 5: 4o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 5. Sample Component for Parabolic Antennas An overview of the features of the Communication Payload Design Tool is located in Appendix A. Likewise, for the Link Budget Calculator Tool, several interfaces were needed: a main interface, a system noise interface, a solar system body distance selection interface, and a antenna database interface. The main interface is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Main interface of link budget calculator The four colored boxes each denote a general domain of discussion for what will be entered/returned. The leftmost is for transmitting information, the next for range information, then for receiving information,and ﬁnally for data information. In each box there are some ﬁelds which are open for input, and some blocked to prevent error (depending upon which options are chosen for a particular calculation). Prior to running a calculation, each enabled input is checked to be sure it is numeric and in the correct range. To allow the user the option of calculating system noise temperature directly, an interface for calculating the system noise temperature"}
