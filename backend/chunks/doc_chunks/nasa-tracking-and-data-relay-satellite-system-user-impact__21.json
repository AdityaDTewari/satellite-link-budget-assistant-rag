A low altitude user spacecraft views a considerably smaller portion of the earth's surface, and therefore is affected by a lesser number of RFI emitters, but. is much closer to these emitters, effectively receiving higher power per emitter than the TDRS. A user, orbiting over high and low RFI emitting regions, experiences a wide range of RFI variations. The most detailed estimate of the RFI that can be experienced by synchronous satellites in the frequency ranges previously allocated to (5)the LDR service has been made by ESL, Inc. in a 1972 study for NASA(5) These estimates were based on an emitter library containing the location, antenna pattern, transmitter power, etc., of about 45,000 RFI sources. 4-1 35,900 km 4-2 In view of the foregoing, a number of requirements must be imposed on the user spacecraft antenna design. To achieve maximum bit rates, the user receiving antenna should attain its maximum gain in the direction of the TDRS and at the same time achieve minimum gain towards the sources of RFI via the antenna side and back lobes. For the return link, the only avail- able method on the user satellite of attempting to overcome the RFI problem is to achieve as high an EIRP in the direction of the TDRS as possible without regard to the side and back lobes. The recent shift in link frequencies from VHF/UHF to S-band (2.25 GHz) eased the requirements on the user in a number of respects. The primary factor is that terrestrially generated RFI no longer appears to be the dominating influence on the user antenna. This fact is evident for two reasons. First, the number of terrestrial transmitters at 2 GHz is far less than the profuse numbers which exist globally at VHF and low UHF. An allo-"}
