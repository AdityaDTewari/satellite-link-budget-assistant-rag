Furthermore, a small number of spacecraft are not referenced to the earth, but are either inertially oriented or are oriented with respect to the sun. An example of the latter is the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO). For these cases, similar visibility studies ean be performed. 3-16 4. USER ANTENNA STUDY 4.1 Introduction The antenna on the user spacecraft is one of the most critical elements in the telecommunications link with the TDRS. An antenna has mass, requires space, usually protrudes from the spacecraft body and often imposes attitude control, gimballing, and deployment constraints, Unlike conventional satellite-to-ground telemetry and command antennas, those on the user are required to exhibit some directivity toward the synchronous altitude TDRS. The higher the achievable gain, the better, since each additional dB of gain in the link is directly translatable to a higher supportable user bit rate. A major factor limiting the telecommunications link performance is terrestrially generated radio frequency interference (RFI). The basic geometry of this RFI problem is shown in Figure 4.1. Each TDRS sees more than 40 percent of the earth's surface, and the LDR return link antenna collects noise power from all emitters in the visible region. The RFI noise level seen by each TDRS will vary slowly, since each TDRS always views the same large region. A low altitude user spacecraft views a considerably smaller portion of the earth's surface, and therefore is affected by a lesser number of RFI emitters, but. is much closer to these emitters, effectively receiving higher power per emitter than the TDRS.
