Manual pointing data for initially acquiring the satellite may also be fed to the gyro assembly. A terminal located on a ship has a three-axis mount since pitching and rolling motions make a two-axis mount inadequate for tracking the satellite. 15-23 l~BSBN IN.......NI\" POWER AMPLIFIER PARAMP MAIN~ RECEIVER \"MOUNTING I IMP TRACKING RECEIVER I I MANUAL Figure 15-8.

The repeater performance, which is crucial to the performance of the entire sys­ tem, has been measured in orbit by means of the special eafth station test fdcility at SRDE (Christchurch, U.K.). To date no.significant change from the performance ,measured by Philco-Ford in the laboratory before launch has been' 6berved. 15.6 QPERATIONAL RESULTS The SKYNET system was designed in a conservative manner and the satellite and ground terminals developed met their specifications. As a result, the. opera­ tional performance has been within the limits that were anticipated. The only space­ craft.malfunction of significance was the failure of one TWT after a year of in-orbit operation. 15.,6.1 System Status There is no SKYNET operational'satellite The, SKYNET-IA satellite launched and orbited in November 1969 ceased operating in November 1972. No orbit was achieved for the SKYNET-tB satellite. Subsequent to November 1972, the SKYNET-I earth terminal network scheduled the U. S. DSCS Phase I satellite on \"as available\" and \"not-to-interfere\"l basis. During 17 February to 2 June 1973, the U.K. and U.S. shared the satellite capacity of the U.S. DSCS Phase II Atlantic satel­ lite. Subsequent to the failure of the Atlantic satellite on 2 June, the U.K. reverted to scheduling the use of the U.S. DSCS Phase I"}
