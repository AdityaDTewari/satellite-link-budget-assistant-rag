S. Air Force, into the feasibility of using an orbital array of dipoles as passive reflectors in a global communication system. The communications concept investigated under Project West Ford could, in principle, provide the following: 1. Immediately accessible, continuous, worldwide communication coverage linking widely separated transmitting and receiving terminals without intermediate relay stations. 2 High dependability by virtue of very low vulnerability to disruption by natural or manmade influences. 3. Capability of resisting electronic jamming and compatibility with techniques for providing cryptographic security. 4. Reliability and ease of maintenance and repair, since the space subsystem is passive and the active electronic equipment is on earth, and since relay stations in remote and possibly politically unstable locations are not required. 5. Ability to carry simultaneously a large number of circuits between transmitters and receivers located in widely separated geographical regions. 6. Relative ease of operation, since ground antennas are not required to track the satellite relay- medium at high rates over large angles. 7."}
