The seasonal variation may be predicted by using seasonal average surface temperature and seasonal average surface relative humidity, which may be obtained from weather information for the site of interest. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 19 The parameters required for the method are: t : average surface ambient temperature (°C) at the site for a period of one month or longer H : average surface relative humidity (%) at the site for a period of one month or longer (NOTE 1 – If no experimental data are available for t and H, the maps of Nwet in Recommendation ITU -R P.453 may be used.) f : frequency (GHz), where 4 GHz  f  55 GHz  : free-space elevation angle, where   5° D : physical diameter (m) of the earth -station antenna  : antenna efficiency; if unknown,  = 0.5 is a conservative estimate. If the median value of the wet term of the surface refractivity exceeded for the average year, Nwet, is obtained from the digital maps in Recommendation ITU -R P.453, go directly to Step 3. Step 1 : For the value of t, calculate the saturation water vapour pressure, es, (hPa), as specified in Recommendation ITU-R P.453. Step 2 : Compute the wet term of the radio refractivity, Nwet, corresponding to es, t and H as given in Recommendation ITU-R P.453. Step 3 : Calculate the standard deviation of the reference signal amplitude, ref,: dB 10 106.34– 3– wet ref N +  =  (42) Step 4 : Calculate the effective path length L: m sin 10 35.2 sin2 4– 2 +  +=LhL (43) where hL, the height of the turbulent layer, is"}
