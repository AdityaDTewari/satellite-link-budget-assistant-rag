(82) With the exception of the antenna system, the dharacteristics of the onboard millimeter wave equipment are not described in the Table since thi-s equipment does not include a millimeter wave communications transponder. Its primiary purpose was simply to make propagation measurements. 13'41 C Table 13-23.
