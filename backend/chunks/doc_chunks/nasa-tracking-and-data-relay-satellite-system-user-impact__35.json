SYNCOM Antenna Configuration 4-18 4.3 S-Band Antenna Studies In order to obtain practical satellite S-band antenna hardware data, this contractor was requested to specifically examine and report on actual satellite antenna designs. This section presents electrical and mechanical performance data for various Hughes satellite antennas, either actual or proposed hardware designs. Where data for the proposed TDRS S-band frequency was not available, the actual designs were extra- polated in terms of mass and dimensions from their operating frequencies. 4.3.1 SYNCOM(16) The SYNCOM antenna required an omnidirectional pattern in a plane perpendicular to the axis of satellite rotation and a directional or flattened \"pancake\" pattern in the plane containing the axis. This was achieved by an array of three collinear skirted dipoles mounted on and extending from the axis of rotation. Figure 4.3 shows the configuration of the SYNCOM antenna. The dipoles are center-fed by annular slots in a coaxial transmission line. A single skirted receiving dipole (for operation at 8 GHz) is shown at the right-hand tip of the antenna structure. The measured antenna radiation patterns provided by the SYNCOM antenna are shown in Figure 4.4 for both azimuth and elevation cuts. It is noted that the SYNCOM antenna operated at 1.8 GHz, however, scaling the dimensions to 2.25 GHz for TDRS has negligible effect on the overall antenna weight, which at 1.8 GHz was 2 kilograms.
