Letusassume that IOOW or20dBWofoutput power isreadily achievable intheground station. Thismeans that theeffective attenuation exceeded for0.15_ ofthetime cannot exceed 28dB. This would require a diversity gain ofatleast 10.2 dB.Alternately, wemayspecify adiversity advantage (see Section 6.5.2). Figure 7.3-3 indicates that anattenuation of 28dBisexceeded forabout 0.3% ofthetime onthe30GHzlink. Therequired diversity advantage istherefore 2,which most available data (Engelbrecht-lgTg andHogg andChu-1975) indicates iseasily obtained. With some foresight, wewill stipulate that 13dBofdiversity gain isrequiredfor theuplink (orthediversity advantage must be2.3). 7.3.6.2 Apply Depolarization Analysis. Thetransmission oftwoorthogonally polarized signals from onesatellite isemployed todouble thespectrum utilization byfrequency reuse. Notevery system, ofcourse, will need to employ this technique, inview oftheadditional complexity andtheadded potential contribution topropagation caused outages. Theterm \"depolarization\" iscommonly employed todesignate the reduction incross-polarization discrimination seen atthereceiving location undersomepropagation conditions. When this occurs, each ofthetworeceived channels (polarizations) contains aninterference signalfrom theother polarization. Therefore, this signal issimilartointerference which may occur from other satellites, terrestrial systems,orother beams ofthesame satellite. Depolarization iscaused byrain, aswell asbyicelayers, inthe troposphere. Therain cancause strong depolarization events, inwhich the cross-polarization discrimination drops to20or15dB. Icedepolarization is quantitatively milder, butappears tooccur more often.Itistherefore convenient totreat twocases ofdepolarization effects, strong andweak. 385 k Strong depolarization events shouldbecorrelated with deep attenuation events, since both stemfrom thesame physical cause, namely rain.
