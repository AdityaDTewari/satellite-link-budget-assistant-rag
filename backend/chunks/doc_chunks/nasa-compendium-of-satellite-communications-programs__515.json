During this initial stage of the Phase II DSCS, only the upgraded Phase I terminals will be included in the system. The traffic will range from one analog voice channel between AN/TSC-54 terminals to 12 analog voice channels between AN/MSC-46 terminals. A few selected links will provide a wideband 17-2 digital traffice capability to support such requirements as wideband digital data and digitized voice signals. These digital links will be time-shared with FM voice cir­ cuits. The baseband and modulation equipment (i.e., FM modems, multiplex, digital modems, etc.) will be those which are presently in use in the Phase L A typical sys­ tem configuration for Stage ia is shown in Figure 17-1. A protected traffic capability (i. e., circuits resistant to RF jamming) will be provided during Stage la on a terminal-to-terminal basis using existing CDMA (spread spectrum) equipment. These links will be dedicated lines between selected users and will pass vital designated traffic only. Communications control of the system during Stage la will consist of scheduling the coordinated system and the maintenance of discipline by a controller. One controller will be established for each satellite. Three to four satellites may be needed to supply a complete global communica­ tions capability among the geographical locations dictated by military requirements. A limited number of AN/TSC-54 terminals will be equipped to provide a contin­ gency capability in Stage la. These terminals will be self-contained in that they will be provided ith FM modems, multiplex, and ancillary equipment to handle 12 voice channels. The FM modems will be capable of modulating an RF carrier with up to 72 voice channels delivered to the terminal in a baseband form from a-separate tech­ nical control facility. Operation of contingency terminals during this stage will be via the satellite NB antennas."}
