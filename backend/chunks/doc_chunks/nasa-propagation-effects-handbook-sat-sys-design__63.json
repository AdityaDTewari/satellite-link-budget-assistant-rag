Depolarization occurs because ofthis lackofspherical symmetry, along with thetendency forthedrops tohave apreferred orientation (i.e., topand bottom flattened). Theeffects oftherain-filled medium onawave propagating through itaredependent ontheorientation oftheelectric field vector with respect tothepreferred drop orientation. Itiseasy topicture theeffect ofthe\"flattened\" raindrops on linearly polarized (LP)waves propagatinq horizontally: Thefields of horizontal LPwaves encounter more water, ontheaverage, than dovertical LP wave fields, andsoaresubjected tomore attenuation andphase shift.AnLP wave atsome arbitrary orientation, say450from thevertical, canbe resolved into anequivalentsetofcomponent waves having horizontal and vertical polarization. After passing through therain, thehorizontal component hassuffered agreater decreased inamplitude, sothepolarization direction hasbeen shifted toward thevertical. Inaddition, thedifferential phase shift between thecomponents hascaused thewave tobecome slightly elliptically polarized. These depolarizing effects ofrain aredescribed more rigorously later. 4.1.2.2IceCrystals. Most ofthedepolarizingeffect ofrain isproduced by differentialattenuation. Therefore rain depolarization andattenuation are fairly well correlated. Starting in1975, when ATS-6 propagation experiments were well underway inEurope, researchers were surprised toseeoccasions of severedepolarization that were completely uncorrelated with rain attenuation. Thecause ofthis \"anomalous\" depolarization hassincebeen I07 identified asorientedicecrystals. Icecanoccur ataltitudes above the freezing level incirrus clouds andatthetops ofcumulonimbus clouds. When something causes theicecrystal symmetry axes toalign themselves, itbrings onapolarization-selective phase effect. Wearenowfairly certain that the electrostatic fields associated with electrically-active storms areatleast onea]igning force. This isconsistent with theobserved abrupt changes in XPDcoincident with lightningflashes. Icedepolarization hasbeentheoretically modelled inamanner analogous torain depolarization. Forthat purpose, theicecrystals are assumed tobeeither oblate orprolateellipsoids, corresponding respectively to\"plates\" and\"needles,\" which aretwodistinct typesof crystals that are known toexist inclouds. Themodel isingood agreement with observations andexplains therapid changes inthephase ofthecrosspolarized waves that accompany lightning flashes. 4.1.2.3 Snow, GraupelandHail.Theanisotropy that isresponsible for depolarization byrain andhigh-altitude icecrystals apparently alsoexists insnow.From S-band andKu-band radar measurements, Hendry, et.al.(1976)"}
