Just as significantly, the DSCS Phase II satellites provide the high capacity entry of the smaller tactical terminals into the strategic networks. These highly flexible, high capacity, multiple access capabilities are made possible 1-23 by cross-strapping two high gain-narrow coverage antennas and a single earth­ coverage antenna on the DSCS Phase II satellite. The planned DSCS Phase III satellites can be expected to advance military communications even further. The latest in the Applications Technology Satellite series, ATS-6, was launched May 30, 1974 and is potentially the most significant step in advancing the technology of satellite communications. A most impressive feature of the ATS-6 satellite is a 9.1-meter (30-foot) diameter parabolic antenna. The ATS-6 also exhibits highly accu­ rate 3-axis stabilization using gas jets and error signals derived from a monopulse receive tracking system, and input/output switching among multiple transponders re­ ceiving and transmitting in different frequency bands. To test the feasibility of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS), the ATS-6 will investigate techniques of employing a synchronous communications satellite as a relay for tracking other sat­ ellites and transferring digital signals between them and a ground station. Other experiments will be concerned with techniques for aircraft position location, air-to­ ground communications using a synchronous satellite, educational TV, and for supply­ ing FM TV reception to small UHF ground terminals with the benefit of the 9.1-meter (30-foot) satellite antenna. Additionally, this spacecraft will investigate uplink RFI at 6 GHz, millimeter wave propagation at 20 and 30 GHz, and signal attenuation at 13 and 18 GHz caused by atmospheric hydrometers. The CTS satellite will include a super-efficiency power transmitting tube,"}
