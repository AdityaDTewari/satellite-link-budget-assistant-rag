Transfer Denial Probability Transfer Denial for the ACTS LBR system occurs when the transmission quality ofthelink hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError Probability or User Information Bit Transfer Rate are worse than aspecified threshold. ANSI (1983) defines this threshold fortheBitError Probability asthefourth root ofitsspecified value, andfortheUser Information BitTransfer Rate as one third ofitsspecified value. Sunoutages and rain fades cause theBit Error Probability toincrease, thus contributing totransfer denial. The limiting case oftransfer denial iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., the system is\"down\" due toequipment orsoftware failure. Transfer Denial Probability canbethought ofastheinverse ofsystem availability. Because system availability isoften used tospecify communication s_te]lite system performance, Transfer Denial Probability becomes avaluable parameter andistherefore included inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. 4.2.3 Disengagement Thedisengagement function fortheACTS LBRsystem isthesame asforother connection oriented data communication system. Generic descriptions oithetwo performance parametecs associated wit:h thedisengagement function aregiven in Section 2and inSeitz and Grubb (1983). These parameters are described mathematically inANSI (1983). Disengagement Time The counting ofDisengagement Time for theACTS LBR system starts when users signal their earth station that:they wish todisengage the call. The user's earth station then issues aCircuit Disconnect message totheMCSvia theinbound order wire. TheMCSinturnissues aDisconnect Acknowledgment to theearth"}
