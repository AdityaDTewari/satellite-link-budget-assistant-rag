Projection of Canada From Geostationary Altitude 18-6 The initial Telesat ground station complex is comprised of approximately 49 Canadian-built stations in five classes whose functions are shown in Table 18-2. This is the baseline system on which the corporation will build and expand as customer requirements and new user contracts for services increase. Table 18-3 includes the names of cities, towns, and settlements near which the terminals are located. A map of the earth terminals is shown in Figure 18-4. Performance characteristics of the Telesat space and earth subsystems are summarized in Table 18-4. The communications system provides for uplink transmission in the 5.925- to 6.425-GHz band and downlink operation in the 3.7- to 4.2-GHz band. TT&C functions required for satellite stationkeeping and positioning are accommodated in the same frequency spectrum. The major contribution of this system to satellite communications technology is that it is the first operational domestic satellite system and, as such, is the forerunner of future domestic systems. Additionally, it will develop and demonstrate earth ter­ minals suitable for unattended operation under severe climatic conditions, including those existing in Arctic regions. 18.3 SPACECRAFT The most significant innovation of the ANIK satellite is the antenna which pro­ duces an elliptical spot beam pattern to cover Canada from its synchronous equatorial orbit (Figure 18-5). The satellite's 152-centimeter (60-inch) antenna is covered with a fine gold mesh, making it optically transparent and, in effect, reducing what otherwise would be a significant disturbance of the satellite by solar pressure. The feed assem­ bly consists of a three-horn aperture which accommodates both receive and transmit frequencies. The arrangement of the horns"}
