Link margin M 8.0 dB Table 2: Link Budget using Gr=TS Multi-Hop Radio Links Multi-hop links are used for sending microwave signals over long distances using intermediate transponders, which can be particularly useful for creating over-the-horizon links. The analysis of the resulting CNR in a multi-hop link is similar to the analysis of cascaded networks when we studied noise gure earlier in the course. Consider a two hope radio link as shown in the notes. C1is the carrier power at the output of the rst link. It is ampli ed by an ampli er, then undergoes gains/losses associated with a standard radio link to the next hop. The cumulative gain between the links is de ned as , so that the output signal power is C2= C 1. The noise power at the output of the link is not simply N 1since the second link may introduce noise as well (either externally or internally generated by components on that link). Hence, N= N 1+N2; Prof. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems Link Budgets Page 5 which is similar to the noise power at the output of a network with gain : the input noise is scaled by , and the network adds a noise of its own at the output. The resulting ratio of the overall noise to the nal received carrier power is NT C2=N2 C2+ N 1 C2=N2 C2+ N 1 C 1=N2 C2+N1 C1: The CNR of the link is C N=\"\u0012C1 N1\u0013\u00001 +\u0012C2 N2\u0013\u00001#\u00001 : This is the result for M= 2 link segments. We can generalize for Mlink segments, which results in C N=\"MX i=1\u0012Ci Ni\u0013\u00001#\u00001 : Prof. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems"}
