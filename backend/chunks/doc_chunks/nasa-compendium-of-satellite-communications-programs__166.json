Areas of interest have included the development of efficient modulation-demodulation systems, random multiple access techniques having no stringent synchronization and control requirements, source signal encoding techniques that reduce required user data rates, low noise receiving systems, and simple antenna systems suitable for small terminals. In the first phase of the program, particular attention was given to X-band fre­ quencies in the vicinity of the microwaVe bands allocated for military communications. 9-1 This emphasis was a natural extension of the X-band capabilities developed during the Project West Ford experiment. (3) In the second phase of the program, attention has been focused on frequencies in the 225 to 400 MHz UIHF communications band. This I band is used for a wide variety of United States government communications services,: to date, six satellites, LES-1 through -6, have been launched as part of this I program and employed in experiments. LES-7 was conceived as a high ERP, three axis stabilized, 136- to 227 kilogram (300- to 500-pound) satellite using a lens antenna and a 19 horn feed cluster to provide a composite beam whose shape could be varied by ground command to fit the earth coverage requirements of a particular link. This sat­ ellite would have operated at X-band but funding considerations plus a greater interest in experiments at the UHF frequencies resulted in its cancellation. Presently, plans exist for a LES-8 and LES-9 to be launched in the spring of 1975. These are experi­ mental \"survivable satellites\" which are to be placed into an elliptical 40 degree in­ clined synchronous orbit. This orbit will result in a fat figure-eight ground track, will provide polar coverage, and will enhance the satellites' survivability by making them harder to locate and track.(3 a) The system will employ frequency hopping"}
