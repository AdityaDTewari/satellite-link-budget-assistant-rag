At these levels of Eb/No -3 acquisition failure rates were less than 10. 2. Triple Diversity Eb/N of 12 dB required for probability of error - less &an 103 at 75 bps data rate. No acquisition problem existed. 3. FM Voice Narrowband FM gave acceptable quality at Pr/No--50 dB which corresponded to Eb/No of about 15 dB for data transmissions over'this channel. No acquisition problem existed. 9-46 Numerous- tests were, conducted\"in attempts to' develop 'aircraft 'antenna systems providing constant gain and polarization losses overan entire hemisphere. Fiked wing aircraft experiments included-evaluations, of crossed, slot, crossed, dipole, and blade antennas (33). The crossed slot antenna supplied relatively'godd hemispherical coverage with antenna gain for the-circularly -polarized antenna avarying between -1 dB and +5 dB. The crossed dipole and blade antennas provided complementary' patterns. with the former displaying good, gain. at elevation angles above 300 to 400 while the latter supplied its peak gain at elevation angles below 300 to 400 The crossed dipole supplied circularly polarized signals and the blade linearly polarized signals. The complementary patterns indicated that these two antennas should be* employed in a combined' system having a switching capability for selecting the appropriate antenna.. Helicopter, antenna tests included evaluations of'crossed dipole- and blade antennas individually and in,variouscombihations mounted, above and below the rotor (36). As,i the, case of the fixed'wing aircraft tests, results indicated that a crossed dipole and blade antenna. should, be-employed in combination. Ldcating it above, the rotor avoided rotor blade modulation caused primarily by blockage of the antenna aperature. 9.3.6. Operational Results These were not operational spacecraft; therefore, no operational traffic was carried. The experimental tactical ground, terminals operated' essentially as expected. One difficulty was that production models of the TATS modem displayed poor reliability. The satellites also operated, generally, as expected in spite of"}
