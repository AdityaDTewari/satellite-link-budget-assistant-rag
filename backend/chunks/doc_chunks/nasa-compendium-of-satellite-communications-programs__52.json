(2) Displayed that belt is predictably affected by solar radiation pressure and does not interfere with radio astronomy. (3) Demonstrated that communications are feasible and multipath time delay and frequency smear are predictable. Telstar (1) Demonstrated performance and reliability, adequate for commercial opera­ tions can be attained with active satellites. (2) Verified that multipath fading was not significant for operation at 4-6 GHz and elevation angles above few degrees. (3) Displayed accurate and reliable acquisition and autotracking of active satellites. Relay (1) N-on-P solar cells shown to be more resistant to radiation than P-on-N cells. (2) Displayed that dew point criteria and leakage tests should be included in power transistor specifications. (3) Indicated that relatively complex command signals are necessary to avoid spurious responses. Table 1-2. Summary of Major Contributions (2 of 3) Program Primary Results Syncom (1) Demonstrated feasibility of placing and accurately positioning satellites in syn­ chronous orbit. (2) Provided first, in orbit, demonstration that time delay and echo are not serious problems in synchronous satellite communications. LES (1) Displayed feasibility of all solid state X-Band satellite transponders even though power out and efficiency were relatively low. (2) Demonstrated feasibility of X-Band and UHF electronically switched despun antennas. (3) Advanced state of knowledge of UHF propagation and noise including RFI. (4) Displayed workable experimental tactical ground terminals. (5) Demonstrated feasibility of high efficiency UHF satellite transmitters operating from unregulated solar array power supply. (6) Accurate autonomous spin axis attitude control was exhibited. (7) Performance potential of sequential decoding as applied to satellite links was displayed. (8) Frequency hopping was shown to provide satisfactory random access and resistance to multipath and RF1. (9) Demonstrated feasibility of autonomous stationkeeping and station changing. Intelsat (1) Demonstrated that time delay and echo are not serious"}
