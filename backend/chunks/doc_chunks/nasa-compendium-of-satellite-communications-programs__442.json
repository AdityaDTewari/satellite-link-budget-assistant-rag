The Auroral Particles experiment is designed to correlate studies& be­ tween particle fluxes and the visible aurora to determine- the nature of the accelerating mechanism in the magnetosphere. * The Particle Acceleration Measurement experiment will investigate the origin of the Van Allen radiation belts encircling the earth. * The Magnetometer experiment will provide- data for a study of the prop­ erties ofvarious magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in the magnetosphere, its tail, and the magnetosheath. *1 The Omnidirectional Spectrometer experiment isdesigned to measure, the omnidirectional fluxes and, spectra of electrons- and protons. * The Solar Cell Radiation Damage experiment is a continuation of previous ATS engineering.studies into solar cell degradation mechanisms. (42) 13; 4.5.16.5 The International Magnetospheric Relay This experiment is designed to collect simultaneous data on the earth's geomag­ netic field from a synchronous world-wide network of earth-based magnetometer 13-127 stations operated concurrently with the EME magnetometer onboard the ATS-6 during the spacecraft's second year of operation. It will require the cooperation of research organizations -inAfrica, the Middle East, Europe and the USSR.

It will be used further as an aid in the design of future spacecraft to be launched by the Titan III-C launch vehicle. Three vibration accelerometers are mounted on the spacecraft to sense space­ craft movement in lateral and vertical directions. An additional accelerometer is mounted on the Titan III-C third stage for vertical movement sensing. The acceler­ ometers data will be telemetered to ground stations and delivered to Goddard for analysis. 13.4.5.17.2 Quartz Crystal Microbalance Contamination Monitor (GSFC) The objective"}
