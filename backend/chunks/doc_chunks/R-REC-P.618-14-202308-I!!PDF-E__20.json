ITU-R P.618 -14 and Pa and Pr are complementary bivariate normal distributions2. The parameter d is the separation between the two sites (km).

The values of the parameters 1 2 1 ln ln ln , , A A Am m  , and 2lnA are determined by fitting each single -site rain attenuation, Ai, vs. probability of occurrence, Pi, to the log -normal distribution:     − = ii AA i rain k imA Q PP lnln ln (34) These parameters can be obtained for each individual location, or a single location can be used. The rain attenuation vs. annual probability of occurrence can be predicted using the method described in § 2.2.1.1. For each path, the log -normal fit of rain attenuation vs. probability of occurrence is performed as follows: Step 1 : Determine rain kP (% of time), the probability"}
