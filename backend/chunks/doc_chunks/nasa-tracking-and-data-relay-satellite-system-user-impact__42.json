This helix, used at S-band, achieves 13 dB gain, weighs 3.3 kg, and measures 30.5 cm long by 5.34 cm in diameter. 4.3.8 Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Antenna (24) The S-band antenna for the GMS consists of an array of cavity- backed slot radiating elements integrated into the spinting spacecraft solar panel. The beam is constantly despun by switching between adjacent modules (four excited simultaneously) so that the angular rate approximately equals the rate of the spinning satellite. Each module of the antenna, shown in Figure 4.15, consists of an array of three linearly polarized elements. An array of three elements provides the required shaping in the elevation plane. Each element consists of a pair of circumferential slots which couple to a waveguide that is excited by a probe. There are a total of six slots in each module. Performance characteristics of the GMS. antenna are given in Table 4.9.

This antenna provides a gain greater than -6 dB over an angle of 140 degrees centered on the spacecraft forward spin axis. Figure 4.16 shows the configuration of the conical log spiral antenna and its corresponding radiation pattern. This particular antenna, which weighs approximately"}
