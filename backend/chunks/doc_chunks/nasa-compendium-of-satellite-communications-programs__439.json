With the radio beacon in geosta­ tionary orbit aboard ATS-F, measurements can be made from a position where the influence of frequency transmitter and an array of whip the magnetosphere and solar wind ments is easily interpreted. (39) environ­ antennas. Each transmitter is amplitude modu­ lated by one or two frequencies and is driven by a common oscillator. Signals will be generated at 40, 140, and 360 MHz frequencies. 13-124 Research organization from a number of countries will conduct studies of the radio beacon using ground receivers based on a unit'designed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Ground stations ranging from computer-controlled to simple manual units will be located at points ih North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa. Many of the units are mobile and will be moved from continent to continent to keep the spacecraft in sight when its orbit is shifted along the equator. (42) Principal Investigator: K. Davies, NOAA, Environmental Research Laboratories, Boulder, Colorado. 13.4.5.16 Additional Technological Experimentation 13.4.5.16. 1 Very High Resolution Radiometer Experiment Located in the Experiments Mbdule, the radiometer will provide both visible and infrared images of day and night cloud cover over about one-fifth of the earth. Information from these images will be used for the determination of cloud motions, storm life cycles;r sall scale phenomena such as thunderstorms, etc., and cloud climatology studies. Operating through an. eight-inch -Cassegranian telescope; the radiometer gen­ erates an image in 20 minutes with resolutions as low as 5.5 km (3.4 miles). While the ATS-6 is in view of the Unit6d States, data collected with this radiom­ eter will be recorded on magnetic tape and selected frames will be supplied to the"}
