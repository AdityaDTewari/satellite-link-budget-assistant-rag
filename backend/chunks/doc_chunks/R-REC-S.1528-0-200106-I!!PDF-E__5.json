In the study of frequency sharing between non-GSO systems, taking into account a non-GSO satellite antenna diagram as realistic as possible allows a more accurate analysis of the interference, while limiting the overestimation of it. It is proposed to use a circular Taylor illumination function which gives the maximum flexibility to adapt the theoretical pattern to the real one. It takes into account the side-lobes effect of an antenna diagram. To simplify the function, the peaks of the side lobes have been considered symmetrical which is a conservative assumption in the analysis of the interference.
