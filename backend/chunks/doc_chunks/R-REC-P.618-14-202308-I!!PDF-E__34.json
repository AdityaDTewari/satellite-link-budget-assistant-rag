Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 23 2.5 Estimation of total attenuation due to multiple sources of simultaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation For systems operating at frequencies above about 18 GHz, and especially those operating with low elevation angles and/or margins, the effect of multiple sources of simultaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation must be considered. Total attenuation (dB) represents the combined effect of rain, gas, clouds and scintillation and requires one or more of the following input parameters: AR ( p) : attenuation due to rain for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Ap in equation (8) AC ( p) : attenuation due to clouds for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Recommendation ITU -R P.840 AG ( p) : gaseous attenuation due to water vapour and oxygen for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by Recommendation ITU-R P.676 AS ( p) : attenuation due to tropospheric scintillation for a fixed probability (dB), as estimated by equation ( 49) where p is the probability the attenuation is exceeded (i.e. the CCDF) in the range from 50% to 0.001%. Gaseous attenuation as a function of percentage of time can be calculated using § 2.2 of Annex 2 of Recommendation ITU -R P.676 if local meteorological data at the required time percentage are available. In the absence of local data at the required time per centage, the mean gaseous attenuation should be calculated and used in equations ( 65) and ( 66). The total attenuation, 𝐴𝑇(𝑝) (dB), for"}
