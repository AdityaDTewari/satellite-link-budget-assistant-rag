Since that time, the organization has expanded to include 85 member nations (as of May 1974). The interim agreements establishing the organitgtion in1264 provided for two management organs.

In this arrangement, COMSAT was also the U.S. representative on the ICSC and under voting weighted according to system ownership was the predominant voice in establishing initial INTELSAT policies. During negotiations initiated in 1969 and concluded on May 20, 1970, the interim agreements were superseded by permanent definitive international arrangements that will become effective in about 1978. The reorganizqtion required by the new agree­ ments will be phased over a 6-year period. The periodbegan in February 1973, when all member nations ratified the new agreements. During the 6-year phase-over period, a Board of Governors, composed of 20 to 25 members voting according to ownership percentage, will replace the ICSC. No single member will control more than one-half the votes on this board, The Board of Governors will receive top level political guidance from an Assembly of Parties, con­ sisting of representatives of all member states, which meet at least once every 2 years. The Board will be guided on system operational matters by a Meeting of Signatories, consisting of the telecommunications representatives of all member states. At the start of the 6-year phase-o- er period, the Board will appoint a Secre­ tary General to"}
