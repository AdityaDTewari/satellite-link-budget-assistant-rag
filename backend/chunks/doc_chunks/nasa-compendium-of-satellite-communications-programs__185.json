Quality was excellent. 'LET-i conducted tests. Transmitter power necessary to attain receiver threshold measured as function of satellite range. Measured values generally agreed* with calculated theoretical values. ** LET-i & LET-2 conducted tests. LET-2 transmitter adjusted 8 dB below that of LET-i. Measured performance agreed well with theoretical performance based on pro­ jected up and down, link parameters, hard limited satellite transfer function, and theoretical receiver threshold. ** With either interfering tone or wide-band noise, no inter­ ference to normal transmissions detected until inter­ fering signal substantially exceeded communications signal on satellite up link. Communications failed only when interference forced the communications downlink signal to drop below receiver threshold. Spreading from -frequency hopping varied over 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 MHz. No change in signal processing threshold occurred except at the 20 MHz rate. At this rate, band­ pass limitations of the satellite and terminals caused some degradation. For operation above threshold, both vocoded modes displayed essentiallythe same performance as found in LET \"back-to-back\" tests. Performance compared to pseudonoise for a broad class of jammers. Results classified. satellite power varying with temperature, age and inexact aiming of satellite antennas; terminal receive noise temperature varying with weather conditions and antenna elevation angle; path loss varying with weather conditions, satellite range, and antenna elevation angle; terminal calibration changing with age; and satellite and terminal bandpass not being entirely flat. **Theoretical threshold occurs at a received power to noise density ratio (P/No) of 43 dB based on an Eb/No of 6 dB and a 4.8 kbps vocoder data rate. This compares to a Pr/No of 52 dB required to obtain comparable quality on a single FM voice"}
