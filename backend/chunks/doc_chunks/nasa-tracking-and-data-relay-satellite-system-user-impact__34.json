When using coax lines the outer shield and the spacecraft structure itself must present zero resistance to the unwanted induced currents. Waveguide line becomes increasingly attractive from a loss standpoint with increasing fre- quency. However, even at S-band physical bulk and weight disadvantages still generally outweigh the electrical advantages. The recommended practice, therefore, is to use coaxial cable feed lines. 4-16 4.2.8 Antenna Weights The antenna weights given in the Tables 4.1 and 4.2 include both the radiating elements and the feed network and represent construction techniques which make use of modern spacecraft antenna structural and materials technology. Techniques of construction such as electroforming resulting in wall thickness of .013 cm, etching on copper clad polyguide and metal forming has substantially reduced the weight of antennas. Choices of lightweight materials such as honeycomb and metal sprayed plastics have become more available. Radiating surfaces, whether directly or parasitically excited, can be perforated with holes up to a half wavelength at the operating frequency without serious degradation of performance. In addition, surfaces can be formed by half wavelength resonant structures eliminating the need for solid surfaces. Feed networks have been developed in air stripline with reduced weight and power loss. The weights of the Hughes antennas for past space missions reflect the materials and structural technology in existence at the time they were designed. Thus, the weights for similar antennas to those given in Section 4.3 could be considerably lower in most cases if up to date antenna technology were utilized. 4-17 -FIBERGLASS SLEEVE -0.02 WALL FROM TRAVELING- CONDUCTOR WAVE TUBE 0.02D TEFLON 0.472D 0.08---1'- 002 ST \\ T0.662DO 0.40D 0073'0 RECEIVER r-40 0.22 091 4.321-9- 41.4021 02522"}
