Table 14-2. Participating Spacecraft Satellite TACSAT 1 Manufacturer and Hughes Aircraft and AF Space and Sponsor Missile Systems Organization Launch Date February 9, 1969 Launch Vehicle Titan IIIC Apogee 36,045 km (22,397 mi.) Orbital Perigee 35,938 km (22, 331 mi.) Data* Inclination 0.60 Period Approx. 24 hrs. Status Spacecraft Active until December 1972 *At initial injection. Attitude control and stationkeeping produced changes. The design of TACSAT 1 represented some major advances in spacecraft tech­ nology. It was a prototype for new high power communication satellites as well as a test vehicle for tactical communications. Features included use of the gyrostat stabi­ lization principle (allowing more flexibility in spacecraft design), more complex re­ peater design, a newly developed 20-watt SHF TWT, and developments in load-bearing solar panels. The design of families of UHF and SHF earth terminals based on exten­ sive coimonality of equipment represented another advancement. The feasibility of UHF and SHF communications through a synchronous satellite by small mobile earth terminals was demonstrated. Use of the tactical transmission system (TATS) frequency-hopping modem for multiple access and overcoming multipath interference was also demonstrated and the attendant problem areas investigated. 14-2 Table 14-3.
