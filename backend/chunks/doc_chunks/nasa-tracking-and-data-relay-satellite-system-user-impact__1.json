It treats the coverage and mutual visibility considerations between the user satellites and the relay satellites and relates these considerations to requirements of antenna beamwidth and fractional user orbital coverage. A final section includes user/T-DRS telecommunication link budgets and forward and return link data rate tradeoffs. 17. Key Words (Selected by Author(s)) 18.
