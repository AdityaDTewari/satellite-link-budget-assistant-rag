The ancillary performance parameters associated with user information transfer aretheUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time andtheUser Fraction of Input/Output Time. TheUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time isthelength of time theuser hascontrol oftheblock transfer, e.g., stopping theinformation transfer toread ascreen full oftext. TheUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time isthetime theuser has control oftheinput oroutput ofthesystem, e.g., typing slower than the system can accept characters. Aswith theancillary parameter foraccess, these give ameasure fortheimpact oftheuser onthe end-to-end system performance. 2.1.3 Disengagement Twoprimary performance parameters andoneancillary performance parameter aredefined forthedisengagement function. These parameters areDisengagement Time, Disengagement Denial Probability, andUser Fraction ofDisengagement Time (see Table 2). ANSI (1983) andSeitz andGrubb (1983) give justifications for the selection ofthese parameters and their mathematical definitions. The disengagement function isasfollows: There isadisengagement function associated with each participant ina data communication sessi_m. Each disengagement function begins on issuance ofa\"disengagement request.\" The disengagement function ends, foreach user, when (i)disengagement hasbeen _\"qL'sted forth_it user; and (2) that user isable toinitiate anew access attempt. 151989010985-025 ........... •.............._____:::__:_.....'_:_ __•__:_i \"7\"_\"_..-_7_%_f_-71TI_T_7 '_'_i__'_ ....._ _7._.___\"__ !
