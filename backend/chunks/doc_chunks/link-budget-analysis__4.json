B.Pt: RF power delivered totheTransmitting antenna , dBW . 1)Pt= Transmit amplifier’s RF output power (Pout) minus feeder losses (Lt). C.GTx: Directional Gain of theTransmitting antenna , dBi. D.GRx: Directional Gain of theReceiving antenna , dBi. E.Losses in thecommunication link: 1)Lp= Free -Space Path Loss (FSPL) caused by spherical spreading of the TxRF signal. a)Lp= 10 log 10[(4πR)2/λ2] ; R = Distance , meters ; λ= Wavelength of RF signal, meters. 2)La= Losses due to attenuation in Earth’s atmosphere . 3)Lta= Losses associated with transmitting antenna : Ohmic & reflection losses. 4)Lra= Losses associates with receiving antenna : Ohmic & reflecton losses. 5)Lpol= Losses due to polarization mismatch . 6)Lother= Any other known loss.
