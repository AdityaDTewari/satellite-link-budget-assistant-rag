Thesystem designer, wanting togain afamiliary with theresults ofthis work,, andtokeep abreast ofnewdevelopments, soon encounters difficulty in finding theinformation needed. This ispartly because ofthenumber of different journals used toreport onresearch inthepropagation area. Inthe IEEE forexample, four societies (AP, COM,MTT, andAES) claim alegitimate interest insome aspects ofthesubject. Another problem isthelack ofa good tutorial ortextbook covering themany diverse topics involved. NASA, which hassupported alarge part oftheexperimental work in thepropagation area, perceived theneed forahandbook ofsome description that would bring together, under onecover, most ofwhat thesystem designer needs toknow about tropospheric propagation above 10GHz. This volume isthe outcome ofaprogram, sponsored byNASA, toproduce such aHandbook. This Propagation Handbook forsatellite system engineers provides a concise summary ofthemajor propagation effects experienced onearth-space paths inthe10to100GHzfrequency range.
