(38) In addition, the spacecraft is to provide an earth-synchronous-oriented platform stabilized along three axes for advanced tech­ nology and scientific experiments. The launch vehicle was a Titan IC missile. The * life expectancy of the ATS-6 Is 5 years, with 2 years at the specified level of perform­ ance. An additional year of operation is expected as a result of fuel saving at launching. Associated with NASA In the Applications Technology Satellite-6 mission are the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the Federation of Rocky Mountain States, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Veterans' Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Maritime Administration, the National Library of Medi­ cine, the Indian Health Service, the U. S. Coast Guard, Alaska, COMSAT Corporation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Universities of Washington, California, and Minnesota, the Canadian Government, the European Space Organization and, later, the Government of India. The new spacecraft will be used for the next several years to test a variety of new space communications concepts. These include direct broadcast of health and education television programs to small and simple ground receiving units in remote regions over a large geographical area; aeronautical and maritime communications, position-location, and traffic control techniques; and spacecraft tracking and data relay. 13-57 The ATS-6 (ATS-F prior to launch) carries equipment for more than 20 techno­ logical and scientific experiments, some of them international in scope. The experi- 0 ments to be performed are described in Section 13.4.5. No other spacecraft similar to the ATS-6 has ever been placed in orbit. This 1,402 kilograms (3,090 pounds) spacecraft consists essentially of an Earth Viewing Module (EVM) connected to a deployable reflector antenna which measures 9 meters (30 feet) in diameter when deployed."}
