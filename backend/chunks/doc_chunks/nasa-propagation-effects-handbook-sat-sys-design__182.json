Thefirst type ofperformance criterion, which will betermed availabilit 7criterion, isgenerally specified asthepercentage oftime that athreshold value isexceeded (ornotexceeded), rather than aprobability. Thisisnatural,sincewhat wecanmeasure ispercentageoftime, andnot probability. (Ergodicity allows thes_ tobeassumed equivalent). Avail ability criteria areinwide use, andthebulk oflong-term performance data analysis hasbeen done from anavailability standpoint. However, such criteria anddata donotgive anyinformation about thetime-variation of performance. Inmany situations,itisdesirable toknow something about how fast theperformance maychange. Some temporal information isgiven bya slightly modified availability criterion, inwhich atime period is specified. Forexample, thecriterion could state that agiven level ofnoise will notbeexceeded formore than acertain percentageofan_month. However, theconnection between suchacriterion andanyquantitative temporal description isobscure. Thesecondtype ofperformance criterion, which expressly describes thetemporal behavior, such asmean outageduration, will betermed outo._.a=qe statistics. Beside theOutageduration,suchstatisticsmight include the distribution function forthetime until thenext outage,given that anoutage isjust over.

Asyet, the available data doesnotcoveralong enoughtime span tobestatistically reliable. Wewill therefore confine ourattention primarilytoperformance criteria that specifyavailability, rather than outage statistics. Thereareseveralsourcesofperformancecriteria.
