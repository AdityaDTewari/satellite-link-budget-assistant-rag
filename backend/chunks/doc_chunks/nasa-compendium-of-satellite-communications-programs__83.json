In spite of this, 34 experiments were conducted between 21 February and 8 March 1964, and the international cooperation displayed made the entire operation a significant diplomatic success. 3.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Project Echo was an experimental program; therefore no operational traffic was carried. Operation of the experimental ground stations was entirely satisfactory as expected. The only difficulty of any significance was caused by occasional errors in the prepass tracking predictions. These errors were of sufficient magnitude to make ground terminal program tracking unsatisfactory. They were a result of the manner in which the orbits of the large lightweight Echo structures were being perturbed from pass-to-pass by solar pressure and atmospheric drag. The tracking difficulties encountered could have been overcome by obtaining more extensive track­ ing data and updating computed orbital elements more often. No unexpected operational difficulties of importance were encountered with the Echo I balloon. At the end of a week of operation, a malfunction occurred in the 3-20 beacon battery supply such that the beacons transmitted only when a solar cell pack was illuminated by the sun. However, the beacons were not designed for a long lifetime, since their primary mission was toassist the, tracking operations during the early orbits of the satellite so that accurate initial orbital elements could be generated. This mission was fulfilled. The only anomalous operation that developed during operations with EchoII was scintillation of the reflected received signal due to wrinkling of the satellite skin. This was caused by the unexpected satellite spin that developed during the first orbit after launch and lower than expected initial inflation pressure. The exact cause of these unusual occurrences was not determined. The beacons on this spacecraft operated for 1 year as planned. 3-21 CITED REFERENCES 1. L. Jaffee, 'Communications in Space, \"fHolt,"}
