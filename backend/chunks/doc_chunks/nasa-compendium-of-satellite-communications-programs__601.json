The earth terminals will be owned by AT&T, while the satellites will be owned and operated by the Comsat General Corporation. AT&T will lease satellite channels from Comsat General. On February 28, 1973, an agreement for provision of domestic communications sat­ ellites was signed between AT&T and the Communications Satellite Corporation (now Comsat General Corporation). The FCC subsequently authorized the construction of the satellite system proposed by AT&T whereby the satellite system would be integrated into the existing AT&T system, except for private line service. Comsat then placed an order with Hughes Aircraft Company to design and build the modified Intelsat IV satellites to be used in the AT&T satellite system. The first of these satellites, Comstar I, should be ready for launch in early 1976. The General Telephone and Electronics Company, now GTE Satellite Corporation (GSAT), initially filed an application in December, 1970, for a separate Domsat system 0 with Hughes Aircraft Company as a partner. On April 18, 1974, AT&T, GTE, and GSAT requested authorization from the FCC to combine the two separate systems into one joint Domsat system whereby four AT&T earth terminals and three GSAT earth terminals would use the Comsat General satellites to provide domestic communications satellite service. As of the publication date, the FCC has not reached a decision concerning the joint Domsat system (FCC Docket No. 20201). 20.3.2 System Description The system will initially involve three satellites and seven earth terminals.
