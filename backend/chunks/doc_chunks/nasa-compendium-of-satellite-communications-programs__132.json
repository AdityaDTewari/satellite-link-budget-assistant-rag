The objectives of the program were: 1. To demonstrate the feasibility of relaying wideband communication signals between ground stations via satellite relays in low altitude orbits 2. To evaluate spacecraft performance and to test the life of communication satellite system components in the orbital environment, and 3. To measure the amount of radiation encountered, its effect on solar cells and diodes, and the effectiveness of various amounts of shielding. The spacecraft for this program were designed and manufactured by Astro- Electronics Division of the Radio Corporation of America, based on system engi­ neering studies by Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge Systems Group. The Relay program was directed by NASA (GSFC). Two active satellites, Relay I and Relay IU, were successfully launched into medium altitude elliptical orbits. Relay I was launched on December 13, 1962, and Relay II on January 21, 1964. The orbital parameters for both spacecraft are shown in Table 7-1. Relay I and II were basically of the same design, although certain modifications were introduced into"}
