Theoretical estimates ofthedegradation of pulse shapesthrough rain have indicated that only minor effects are observed. Thecalculations (Crane-1967) indicated that pulse distortion does notbecome significantuntil total rain attenuations oftheorder of100dB areencountered. Since current linkmargins donotallow suchhigh attenuations, thelinkwill fail duetosignalattenuation before thepulse shape affects transmission. Amplitude variationwith frequency becomes significant atfrequencies inthevicinity ofmolecular absorption bands, such asthe50-70 GHzoxygen absorption band. Thegreatest dispersiveeffectwould occur attheindividual absorption lines which arequitenarrow (Liebe -1975). However, duetothe great pathattenuation present atthese frequencies, itisnotlikely they would beusedforearth-space communications.
