ITU-R S.1528 1 RECOMMENDATION ITU-R S.1528 Satellite antenna radiation patterns for non-geostationary orbit satellite antennas operating in the fixed-satellite service below 30 GHz (Question ITU-R 231/4) (2001) The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly, considering a) that the use of space station antennas with the best available radiation patterns will lead to the most efficient use of the radio-frequency spectrum; b) that both elliptical and circular beam antennas are used on operational space stations; c) that although improvements are being made in the design of space station antennas, further information is still required before a reference radiation pattern can be adopted for coordination purposes; d) that the adoption of a design objective radiation pattern for space station antennas will encourage the fabrication and use of orbit-efficient antennas; e) that it is only necessary to specify space-station antenna radiation characteristics in directions of potential interference for coordination purposes; f) that for wide applicability the mathematical expressions should be as simple as possible consistent with effective predictions; g) that nevertheless, the expressions should account for the characteristics of practical antenna systems and be adaptable to emerging technologies; h) that measurement difficulties lead to inaccuracies in the modelling of spacecraft antennas at large off-axis angles; j) that the size constraints of launch vehicles lead to limitations in the D/λ values of spacecraft antennas; k) that a multiple beam antenna on the non-geostationary-satellite orbit (non-GSO) has to provide an earth coverage field-of-view (FOV) of up to ± 30° half-cone angle from a medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite, and up to ± 60° from a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite; l) that most non-GSO fixed-satellite service (FSS) satellites are planned to use a large number of beams per satellite with either steerable or fixed beams; m) that the peak gain of a multiple beam antenna decreases while"}
