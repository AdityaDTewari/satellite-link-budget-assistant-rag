The second goal was the achieve­ ment of digital data transmission at high rates consistent with the density of the dipoles in orbit. The fact that these two goals were to be achieved at the same point in time required the use of two receivers. The receiver employed for measuring the propagation characteristics of the dipole belt was essentially of the RAKE-type and i-s shown in the block diagram of Figure 5-1. The tap unit. (tapped delay line) outputs are used to form real-time displays of multipath envelope and doppler spectra and to derive error signals for frequency and delay tracking and for gain control. The communication receiver is essentially of the correlation type using quadrature, full wave, square law detection. The block diagram for this receiver is shown in Figure 5-2. 5.3 SPACECRAFT Early in May 1963 a package containing 4. 8 x 108 copper dipoles, each 0. 00178 cm in diameter and-1. 78 cm in leigth, was placed into a nearly circular, nearly polar orbit at a mean altitude of 3650 km. A radio command signal from the ground initiated the release of the dipoles from the package. At first the dipoles formed a rather compact cloud which, due to differential linear velocity increments imparted to each dipole, gradually spread around the orbit.
