It provides near-synchronous communication satellites to relay voice and digital communications between fixed and mobile users. Twenty-six DSCS Phase I satellites were launched into near equatorial orbits at a near synchronous altitude of approximately 33, 891,600 meters (18, 300 nautical miles) via the four launches shown in Table 12-2. (6)(7)(8) The Titan IHC was used for the launching vehicle. Satellite dispensers were used and thenecessary facilities were available to implemeht and support the launching operation, the satellite injec­ tion into orbit, the ensuing telemetry readout, and the tracking and ephemeris de­ terminations. The technical support of the launching phase was provided by the Air 12-2 Force Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF). Since the completion of the launches, the SCF has providedorbital tracking data and telemetry monitoring to determine satellite health. This information is forwarded to the Satellite Communication Con­ trol Facility (SCCF) to be used in system control. Table 12-2.
