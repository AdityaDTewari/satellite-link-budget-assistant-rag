This mechanically despun antenna is the most important innovation in this series of satellites, and perhaps the most critical. Special lubri­ cants are used for the bearings, which are exposedto the hard vacuum of space and a wide temperature range. Because INTELSAT I)has no VHF telemetering and tele­ command equipment (these functions are handled at C-band), an additional antenna at 6 GHz with substantially omnidirectional properties has been provided to receive tele­ command signals for the initial setting up in orbit. The expected lifetime of the satel­ lite is 5 years. 10-31 Table 10-14.
