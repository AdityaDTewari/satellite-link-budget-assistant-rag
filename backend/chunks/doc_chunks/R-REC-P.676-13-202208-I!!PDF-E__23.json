If needed, equations (24a) to (24c) in Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU -R P.834 (and the associated maps) can be used for interpolation and extrapolation of these profiles. Rec. ITU-R P.676 -13 23 7 The elevation angle at or near the surface of the Earth is the apparent rather than the free - space elevation angle. For free -space elevation angles less than or equal to 10 degrees, the apparent elevation angle can be calculated from the"}
