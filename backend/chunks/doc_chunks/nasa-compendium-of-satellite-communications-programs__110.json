This situation is depicted in Figure 5-4. Measurement of the propagation characteristics of the belt was one of the goals of the second experimental program. The dipole belt provided a channel in which sig­ nals were communicated from one point to another by scattering from a large number of dipoles in a volume of space defined by the intersection of two antenna beam patterns with the belt. Each dipole behaves like an independent scatterer, and consequently the received, signal at any given time is the sum 'of the signals scattered by a large numb'er of dipoles. The fact that the dipole scatters are not concentrated at a single point influences the performance of the system in detail. Specification of the received signal-to-noise ratio is notsufficient to characterize a spread dhannel such as the orbital dipole belt. The minimum additional information that is required to give an adequate description of the communications performance is knowledge of two parameters -multipath spread (L) and doppler spre'ad (B) -which are measures of 5-10 80 - - INSUFFICIENT DATA DAYS AFTER 60 .EJECTION go0 01 Sa20 MURGINABl PAGE IS81 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 OF PORQJJJ TIME FROM MAXIMUM DENSITY (--0 -120 -/ 8 AII -80 -17 117 124 48 A 4 146 { -40426 19 C-- c 56 82\" 40 140 so0 -222+ a *- 40 km OUT-OF-PLANE 32 1 + 120 40 km IN-PLANE \" 22.6 252 I I I I I I i I I 0 40 80 120 1o 200 240 DAYS AFTEREJECTION Figure 5-3.
