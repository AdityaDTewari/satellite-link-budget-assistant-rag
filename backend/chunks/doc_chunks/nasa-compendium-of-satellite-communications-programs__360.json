Spin stabilization about this axis was the planned method of satellite control-during the transfer orbit, apogee motor firing, and maneuvers to position the spacecraft on station. -However, greater than expected nutation during this phase produced loss of spacecraft control and ultimately resulted in the present spin about the proper axis but in a direction opposite (i. e., counterclockw'se) to that needed for the planned­ operation of' the two-stage yo-yo despin mechanism. Consequently, a scheduled investigation of gravity gradient stabilization was again left unaccomplished. Modi­ fications to earth terminal'equipment, however, have allowed many of the remaining experiments'aboard this satellite to be partially successful. In particular, objectives have been partially attained with regard to the millimeter wave, L-Band, and environ­ mental measurements experiments. The primary earth terminals involved in the few C-Band communications opera­ tions conducted -included the terminals employed for-the testing on ATS-1 and ATS-3 (see TAble 13-3) with the addition of the terminal at Ahmedabad, India. The latter became operational in 1967 and conducted tests and demonstrations with ATS-2. The major terminals participating in the L-Band and millimeter wave tests on ATS-5 are defined in Table 3-20. (31, 32, 33) All of these terminals became operational in 1969­ and 19.70. Tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) was provided by separate installations included in the NASA ATS facilities located respectively at Rosman, North Carolina;- Cooby Creek, Australia; and Mojave, California. In addition, some telemetry and tracking was provided by terminals at Johannesburg, South Africa; Tananarive, Madagascar; and Kauai, Hawaii. Satellite launchings were provided by NASA. The launch difficulties on ATS-2 and 4 precluded any significant contributions to satellite"}
