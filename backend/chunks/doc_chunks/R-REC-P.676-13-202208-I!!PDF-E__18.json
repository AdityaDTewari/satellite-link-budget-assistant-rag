Equation (9) of Recommendation ITU-R P.834 is an approximation to equations (22a) and (22b) for the mean annual global reference atmosphere. 2.2.5 Excess atmospheric path length Since the tropospheric refractive index is greater than 1, the effective atmospheric path length exceeds the geometrical path length, in which case the excess atmospheric path length, Δ𝐿, is: Δ𝐿=∑ 𝑎𝑖(𝑛𝑖−1)𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖=1 (km) (23) Rec. ITU-R P.676 -13 15 The term excess atmospheric path length is synonymous with the term excess radio path length in Recommendation ITU -R P.834 ; and a method of predicting the excess radio path length as a function of location, day of the year, and apparent elevation angle is given in § 6 of Recommendation ITU-R P.834 .

ITU-R P.676 -13 FIGURE 5 Path through the atmosphere 3 Dispersive effects In addition to the attenuation described in the previous paragraph, which is based on the imaginary part of the frequency -dependent complex refractivity, oxygen and water vapour introduce dispersion, which is based on the real part of the frequency -depende nt complex refractivity. This effect is described in terms of phase dispersion vs. frequency (deg/km) or group delay vs. frequency (ps/km), and, similar to attenuation, dispersion can be calculated for slant paths. Similar to equation (1), the specific gaseous phase dispersion, φ, is given by: φ=φ𝑜+φ𝑤=−1.2008 𝑓(𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′(𝑓)+𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′(𝑓)) (deg/km) (24) where φ𝑜 is the specific phase dispersion (deg/km) due to dry air, φ𝑤 is the specific phase dispersion due to water vapour; 𝑓 is the frequency (GHz); and 𝑁𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑔𝑒𝑛′(𝑓) and 𝑁𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑟′(𝑓) are the real parts of the frequency -dependent complex"}
