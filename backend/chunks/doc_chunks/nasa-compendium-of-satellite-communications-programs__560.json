These stations are engineered to provide high quality transmission and reception of television signals. As these stations are also designed for unattended operations, they are equipped with a supervisory system which permits them to be monitored and controlled from a maintenance center located remotely from the station site. All NTV stations are equipped with a 10.2-meter (33.3-foot) diameter antenna, which in conjunction with a low-noise parametric amplifier provides a minimum G/T of 28 dB/0 K. Basically, these antennas are fixed (with the exception of the Harrietsfield * Station which has recently been outfitted with a step-track system, similar in nature to the systems at Allan Park and Lake Cowichan) and require no tracking facilities; however, they can be steered by remote drive over a limited range in the event that they have to be readjusted to a new satellite orbital position. Accurate satellite station-keeping ensures that the satellite remains near the peak of the antenna beam. The communications equipment at each NTV station, with the exception of the one at Riviere Rouge, includes four TV receivers and a single TV transmit chain, enabling each station to receive four RF channels simultaneously, and to transmit on any one of the RF channels in use for television. Normally, however, three receivers are set up for program reception and the fourth is on standby and is automatically switched in, should any one of the three fail. The Riviere Rouge Station is equipped with two additional TV transmit chains. The transmitters and receivers can be tuned to any of the RF channels in use for television by means of control signals transmitted from the Heavy Route stations over a cue and control channel which accompanies each 18-27 0 ALLAN PARK ~,m r m z LAKECOWICHAN E --\" --u -z TT"}
