Warner† NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, 44135, USA In an eﬀort to make future communications satellite payload design more eﬃcient and accessible, two tools were created with intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The ﬁrsttool, the Visual Communication Payload design software, allows designers to graphicallydesign their payload by using a simple drag and drop action with payload componentsonto an area within the program. Information about each picked component is pulledfrom a database of common space-qualiﬁed communication components sold by commericalcompanies. Once a design is completed, various reports can be generated , such as theMaster Equipment List. The second tool, RF Link Budget Calculator software, is a link budget calculator designed speciﬁcally for ease of use. Other features of this tool include being able to access a database of NASA ground based apertures for near Earth andDeep Space communication, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) baseapertures, and information about the solar system relevant to link budget calculations. Thelink budget tool allows for over 50 diﬀerent combinations of user inputs, eliminating theneed for multiple spreadsheets and the errors associated with wrong inputs. Both of theaforementioned tools increase the productivity of space communication systems designers,and have the colloquial latitude to allow non-communication experts to design preliminarycommunication payloads.
