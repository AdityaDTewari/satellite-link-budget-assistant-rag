Then thefollowing approximate conversions apply (6TE-1g72): dBrncO=10logloPWOp +0.8=dBaO +6.8=dB_p+90.8 =88.3 -S/N Ingeneral, moststandards involve long term nominal objectives and short term orworst case threshold values. •Below this threshold, an\"outage\" exists. FMlinks areoftenengineered sothat thereceiver FMthreshold value ofC/Nisatorwithin afewdBofthat value which gives theabsolutely minimum acceptable performance.Thatis,thereceiver RFperformance threshold andthebaseband (acceptable) performance threshold arematched. Asanexample ofalong-term performance objective,thelatest CCIR position (reflected inRecommendation 353-3, CCIR-1978) isthat 10,000 pWOp one-minute mean noise power shouldnotbeexceeded more than 20%ofany month. TheoldU.S. criterion forlong intertoll trunks required 20,000 pWOp orless nominal(intheabsence ofafade). Inthecase oftelevision signals, various criteria require aweighted baseband S/Noffrom 50to59dB toexist undernominalconditions. Noise performancerequirements forsmall percentages canbethought ofas\"outage\" conditions. TheCCIR recommendation isthat 1,000,000 pWO (unweighted) measured with a5ms.integration time, exist notmore than 0.01% ofanyyear. Anintermediate requirement isalsoestablished: that 50,000 pWOpone-minutemean power notbeexceeded formore than 0.3_ ofanymonth. IntheU.S., acriterion of316,000 pWOp for.02%ofthetime isoften e_loyed. DCAstandardssimilarly require that 316,000 pWOp notbeexceeded formore than 2minutes inanymonth norforoneminute inanyhour.

Indeed, there arearguments suggesting that newapplications require specialized criteria. Current criteria, developed forterrestrial systems orforsatellite communications systems below 10GHz, maynotbe applicable formillimeter wave systems where thestatistics differ appreciably. Note that outagecriteria, such astheoneDCAhaspromulgated (probability ofoutage onafive minute call), arevery different from nominal orlong-term availability criteria. Because propagation outages inthe frequency range ofinterest typically have durations ontheorder ofmagnitude ofminutes, itisnotstraightforward torelate availability statistics to outage probability statistics. Some approximations maybemade from rain statistical data andlimited data onfade depth vs.duration, butmore theoretical andexperimental work appears tobenecessarybefore such outage criteria canbereliably applied indesign.Inthis Handbook, therefore, we have found itnecessary toemphasize availability criteria. Where duration data isavailable, itmaybeemployed asasubsidiary, orsecond order, check onwhether system requirements aremet. 7.2.4 Summar_ ofNominal Criteria andTheir Application Thenominal performance criteria fordigitalandanalog systems are"}
