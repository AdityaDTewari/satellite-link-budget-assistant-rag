Therefore, Block Transfer Time isincluded inthesetofTDMA performance. Block Error Probability Block Error Probability isclosely related totheBit Error Probability, theprobability that ablock ofuser information isreceived inerror. Oneor more incorrect bits inablock constitute ablock error. Therefore, the measurement ofBlock Error Probability isalso included inthe TDMA system performance parameters. Block Misdelivery Probability Block Misdelivery Probability isthe probability that areceived user information block was inteuded foranother destination. Theprimary cause of ? block misdeliveries are undetected errors inthe circuit request address information orBTPgeneration anddistribution. Hewever, errors intheaddress information would cause anincorrect access and thus becounted inthe Incorrect Access Probability calculation. Errors inBTP generation and distribution would allow TDMA bursts orsubbursts tobetransmitted atthe wrong time, misrouting data, andthus misdelivering auser's information block. However,asmentioned for the Incorrect Access Probability parameter, BTP errors would cause the TDMAnetwork tolose synchronization and fail. Therefore, due toits low probability ofoccurrence, Block Misdelivery Probability isnotincluded inthesetofTDM_ system performance parameters. Block Loss Probability Block Loss Probability for TDMA systems isthe probability that an information block does notreach thedestination within tbespecified maximum transfer time due toexcessively long transfer delays orlost blocks. The specified maximum transfer time isthree times the Block Transfer Time (ANSI, 1983). Since the B]ock Transfer Time isexpected toberelatively constant, theprimary mechanism contributing toBlock Loss Probabl]ity would be thesystem mlsrouting orloslng blocks. Hisrouting blocks wasdiscussed for Block Misdeli_ery Probability. Losing blocks would belikely during deep fades onsystems notusing anyform ofARQprotocol. IfanARQprotocol isused, a transmission error cancause anegative acknowledgement (NAK) tobechanged to apositive acknowledgement (ACK),thus blocks requiring retransmission would be lost. Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware and software \"crashes\" where thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. Block Loss Probability isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters.
