From Section 5.1, the forward link rate is given by R = Gu + 14 dB-Hz where Gu is the antenna gain on the user satellite. Thus, Gu = R -14 = 30.1 -14 = 16.1 dB maximum, and = 20 -14 = -6 dB minimum. The bottom half of Figure 5.1 shows the relationship between the forward link rate and user antenna gain. It is seen , for example, that a 500 bps command rate can be achieved with a user antenna gain of 13 dB. For the return link, the Statement of Work requires a minimum telemetry rate of 1 kbps and a maximum of 10 kbps. Again, from Section 5.1, the return link rate is given by R = EIRP + 27 dB-Hz where EIRP is the user equivalent isotropically radiated power. Thus, EIRP = R -27 = 40 -27 = 13 dBW maximum, and = 30 -27 = 3 dBW minimum. For the two different levels of user RF power, I watt and 5 watts, the top half of Figure 5.1 shows the influence of user antenna gain on the return link bit rate. A modest 5 dB user antenna gain is seen to produce either a 1.6 kilobit .or an 8 kilobits per second return link rate, depending on the user's RF power level. 5-7 A number of conclusions can be drawn from the data rate tradeoffs shown in Figure 5.1. First, the return link appears to be adequately sized to bracket the user data rates specified in the study Statement of Work. Needless to say, the"}
