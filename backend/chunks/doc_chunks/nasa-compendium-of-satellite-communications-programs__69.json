This was a result of performance as a function of frequency, being, in general, unaffected by these passive reflectors. Strictly speaking, fading, due to scattering from the wrinkled skin of these reflectors, did become more of a problem at the higher frequencies. Operating frequencies for the major participants involved in experiments with Echo I and H1 are summarized in Tables 3-4 and 3-5, (5)(10) respectively. The two GHz frequencies were chosen because they were available for allocation by the Federal Communications Commission and because they were the correct frequencies for future satellite and deep space communications activities. The 960-1Hz frequency was chosen because equipment on this frequency existed at Goldstone from an earlier program. 3-7 ECHO 2 'A'l ANTNNA 18 (60' ANEN 5(28') ANTENNA 18m(6') ANTENNA osu,9OLUMBUS OHIOARAPAHO STATION NRLSTUMPNECK MD.

(5)(14)(15) There were no multiple-access restrictions except the normal requirements for signal orthogonality, since the satellite was simply a passive reflector. Therefore, any of the commonly conceived multiple­ access techniques (e. g., time, frequency, and code-division multiple access) could have been employed. Frequency division was used because of its ready compatibility with common existing earth terminal technology. For a perfectly spherical reflector with a smooth skin, there are"}
