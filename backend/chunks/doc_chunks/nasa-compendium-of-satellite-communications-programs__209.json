The automatic stationkeeping system on LES-6 used an accurate onboard clock to provide an indication of the time at which the satellite should arrive at a given point in its orbit (2 1 ) ( 2 8 ) . The time of actual arrival, as determined by the clock and the coincidence of sun and earth sensor observations, was compared with the desired time to generate longitude position errors to be corrected by firing thrusters as appropriate. Thrusters firings were-activated at satellite orbital points separated by 1800 in order to ensure that orbit eccentricity remained constant. Either cold ammonia gas thrusters or pulsed plasma.electric microthrusters, using solid Teflon as the propellant, could be employedfor corrections. 9-41 Both thruster systems .displayed proper and reliable operation although some intermittency of the pulsed plasma thrusters was. observed after they had fired for several thousand hours 4 7 ). Further, the system displayed a capability pf maintaining the spacecraft within about 2°,of a desired reference longitude. The earth albedo and space radiation environment experiments werecarried-on LES-6 alone. Both experiments have retutrned considerable. data that has been useful in characterizing the space environnient.- In-the case of the radiation experiment, this was accomplished in spite of interference produced when the commnmiication, antennas situated closest to the -6xeriment were'energized 4 8 ) . Data taken during periods of interferehce were unusabld: 'However, there were times defined by a set of earth and sun angles during which valid data-could.be obtained; Solar cellexperiments on LES-5 and LES-6 returned"}
