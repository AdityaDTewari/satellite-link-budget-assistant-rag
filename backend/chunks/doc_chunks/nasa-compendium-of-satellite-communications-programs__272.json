Two groups of tesis were conducted concomitantly: the Performance Test Plan to determine how well the spacecraft performance in orbit met contract specifications, and the Experimental, Test Plan to deternfine system parameters when the spacecraft is used with the'opeiating ground ,stations. The Per­ formance Test Plan was c6mpleted in four days and included measurement of the spacecraft's-effective isotropic radiated-power (EIRP), receiving sensitivity; trans­ ponder gain and frequency response, noise power ratios (NPR), intelligible crosstalk, antenna patterns, polarization, and insensitivity of the command system to interference. The only notable failing of the Performance Test Plan was that the specification for intelligible crosstalk of -45 dB could not be met with TWT No. 1. For this reason, TWT No.. 2 was used for all commercial operations. The Experimental Plan tests were conducted for 18 hours per day for aweek. System characteristics with a variety of loading conditions were measured for all stations. It was'determined that the 240 circuit capadity could be realized by the four high-capacity stations and that a 6-dB margin existed in fair weather. It was also , determined that the antenna gain and receiving sensitivity for the four large stations were similar to within 1 dB. 10-53 Tests on system characteristics for monochrome TV were performed until all stations reached agreement on the optimum operating parameters. Three weeks after launch, the spacecraft and the earth stations were properly tested, and the space segment of the system was ready for use. The terrestrial net­ work operators then began circuit lineup. For the 120-channel multiplex system to be used for the first commercial service, it was necessary to allow 4 weeks for ad­ justments at a circuit level both in the U. S. and in the four countries in Europe. These tests"}
