Complete random access to the satellite repeater is complicated by the necessity to control the uplink power of the users. Joint Service Monitor/Control experiments were performed to determine tradeoffs involved between a system that is too costly or unreliable (no control) and a system that operationally is too restrictive in use (com­ plete control). The experiments were conducted using the TACSAT UHF mode. The primary control concept allowed complete random access for all 75-bps TTY, TATS users and for all alert message users subject only to EIRP restrictions. All other communications modes had to obtain prior approval from the real-time monitor/control agency before accessing the satellite. A schedule of priorities in user communication modes. was set up, and each service was allocated a portion of the satellite EIRP for nonrandom access communication modes. For power control, all UHF terminals were allowed one of two radiated power magnitudes, depending on the receiving and trans­ mitting antenna gains. Experimental results were obtained that will be useful in the design of an operational system. The development of different modulation and multiple-access techniques led to an investigation of the capability and compatibility of simultaneous use of different tech­ niques. One experiment involved simultaneous use of TATS and FM/FDM with the TACSAT 500-kHz bandwidth UHF mode. Only certain TATS codes were used such that the .TATS signal energy did not fall in a selected portion (81. 6 kHz wide) of the repeater bandwidth. This allowed use of FM channels one through seven. Twelve low data rate 14-19 TATS at 18 dBW per access, two high data rate TATS at 29 dBW per access, and three FM'accesses at 31 dBW per access were used. Results showed a C/kT of 59 dB for the"}
