When an RF channel is operated in a multiple access mode under the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique, the number of voice circuits per carrier is partially a function of the number of carriers and the G/T of the accessing earth stations. For example, five RF carriers could support a total of 110 two-way voice circuits between one earth station having a G/T of 37.5 dBrncO, and four other earth stations having a G/T of 28 dB. Presently, one of the RF channels is utilized in this manner with three carriers providing message service between Allan Park and Frobisher Bay and Resolute. Another application of this technique provides 240 two­ way circuits between Allan Park and Harrietsfield. In addition, Telesat will be imple­ menting time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques in the near future, which will significantly increase message capacity. Another RF channel is used in a multiple access mode"}
