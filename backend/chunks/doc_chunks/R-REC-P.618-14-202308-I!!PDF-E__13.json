This method does not require the cumulative distribution of the rain attenuation at either frequency. These prediction methods may be applicable to uplink power control and adaptive coding and modulation, for example: a) The first method predicts the instantaneous uplink rain attenuation at frequency f2 based on the measured instantaneous downlink rain attenuation at frequency f1 for a p% risk the actual uplink rain attenuation will exceed the predicted value. b) The second method predicts the uplink rain attenuation at frequency f2 based on knowledge of the downlink rain attenuation at frequency f1 at the same probability of exceedance. 2.2.1.3.1 Conditional distribution of the frequency scaling ratio of rain attenuation This prediction method is based on the following relation between A2 (dB), the instantaneous rain attenuation at frequency f2, and A1 (dB), the instantaneous rain attenuation at frequency f1.
