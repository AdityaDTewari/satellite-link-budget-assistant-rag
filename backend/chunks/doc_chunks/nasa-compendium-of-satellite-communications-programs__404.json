Communications with ATSOCC is is accomplished by one SCAMA voice circuit and one full duplex TTY circuit. Figure 13-22 shows the Transportable Ground Station (TGS) Block Diagram. CF BAND Figure 13-22. TGS Block Diagram 13.4.4.5 Mobile Terninal ( 4 1 ) The ATS-6 Mobile Terminal will be located at a remote site. It is capable of transportation over normal highways at maximum legal speeds and at low speeds over inproved roads to the installation sites. The terminal can be shipped by air or sea. The Mobile Terminal is equipped to transmit and receive simultaneously on two bands, as shown below. 13-85 Operational Bands Function C-and S-band Receive and transmit C-and L-band Receive and transmit C-band and UHF Receive and transmit on C-band but receive only on UHF The antenna subsystem is capable of operating with geostationary synchronous satellites. In addition to transmission and reception of communications, the antenna subsystem is also used for range and range-rate signals. The terminal is required primarily for the following: * Television Relay Using Small Terminals (TRUST) experiment * Position Location and Aircraft Communications Experiment (PLACE) * Ranging * Emergency support for communications in remote locations * Demonstrations * Accommodation of experiments on ATS-G To accomplish the above, the subsystems, described below, constitute the mobile terminal. • 6.4-meter (21-foot) polar mount antenna with C-band transmit and re­ ceive, and UHF receive focal point feeds * 4.6-meter (15-foot) polar mdunt antenna with S-and L-band transmit and receive focal point feeds * 70-MHz wideband modulator * 70-MHz wideband demodulator * C-, S-, L-band transmitters including upconverters, drivers, and power amplifiers * Test translator and performance monitors 13-86 * C-, S-, L-band and UHF receivers including low noise preamplifiers, post amplifiers and wideband modulators * Power generating and distributing equipment * Miscellaneous equipment.including racks, pallets, intercommunications system,"}
