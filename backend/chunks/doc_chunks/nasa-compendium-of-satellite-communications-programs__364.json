For the downlink, settings of + 0.1, +1 .0, + 10 or + 50 MHz from the 15.3 GHz carrier were possible (34) Receivers employed down conversion mixing, filtering, envelope detectors, and phase detectors to derive measurements of carrier, upper sideband, and lower sideband amplitude plus relative sideband phase. The L-Band signal processing employedwas dependent uponthe modes selected for satellite operation. Four modes were commonly employed as follows: 13-39 1. Narrowband L-L (FM/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band and retransmits at L-Band (frequency translatioii). 2. Cross Strap L-C & C-L a. L-C Cross-strap (SSB/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band (SSB), translates to video (500 to 600 kHz) and uses the video signal to modulate (FM) the spacecraft C-Band VCO; the output of which is then translated to C-Band and retransmitted. b. C-L Cross-strap (FM/FM) Spacecraft receives at C-Band, frequency translates to L-Band, and retransmits (Frequency translation). 3. L-L (SSB/FM) Spacecraft receives at L-Band (SSB) translates to video (500 to 600 kHz) and uses the video signal to modulate (FM) the Spacecraft L-Band VCO; the out­ put of which is then translated to L-Band for transmission to the earth station. 4. Wideband Data Mode (FM downlink only) Video signals from onboard-spacecraft equipment modulates (FM) the satel­ lite L-Band VCO the output of which is upconverted to L-Band for transmis­ sion to earth. A fifth possible mode was identical to narrowband L-L (FM/FM) except'a wide bandwidth was supplied. Link performance for modes involving the C-Band downlink and a high uplink S/N was essentially as defined in Tables 13-7 and 13-8. Typical link performance for modes involving the L-Band downlink and a high uplink S/N was as described in Table 13-22 for a narrowband L-L FM/FM link. The frequency translation"}
