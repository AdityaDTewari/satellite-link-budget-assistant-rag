Asshown inFigure 16,thedestination ACTS COnotes that thedestination user isbusy andsends a\"busy tone\" back totheoriginating user indicating user blocking (primary reference event 4). The originating user goes back \"on hook,\" initiating anormal circuit disconnect sequence. 4.3.4 ACTS LBRSystem Performance Experiment Configuration Figure 17shows theACTS LBRsystem configuration forsystem performance measurement experiments between asingle user pair. During the experiments both users have 80286-class PCs running special experiment control and data 661989010985-076 ()71989010985-077 w 68 1989010985-079 7(11989010985-080 collection programs. Theoriginating user's computer automatically calls the destination user's computer, transfers apreset number ofpseudorandom datafiles, and then disconnects the call. Both user/system interfaces are monitored. Ateach step oftheaccess, transfer, anddisengagement functions, therelevant interface events arerecorded and time stamped. Files ofthese time stamped reference events along with copies ofthetransferred data files are stored inboth user's computers. Inthe data reduction step ofthe measurement process, estimates ofthe\"speed\" parameters aregenerated from the time-stamped reference event files and estimates ofthe \"accuracy\" and \"reliability\" parameters aregenerated bycomparing thesource anddestination copies ofthepseudorandom data files. 5.CONCLUSION Ithasbeen established that theANSI system performance standards canbe used tomeasure andcompare theperformance ofvastly different communication systems, most notably communication satellite systems. Using this \"corn,non yardstick\" hasmar,y adv;_.tages: identifying what aparticular system does best\" helping toidentify areas within asystem that can bechanged toimprove performance, orpinpointing areas where costs canbereduced without serio_is impact onsystem performance; determining which co,npeting system bes_ fits a user's needs\" identifying the deficient vendor inmultivendor systen..\" and having the methods and tools toconduct repeatable system performance experiments. Byusing these system Derformance standards for quantifying existing com,nunication satellite system performance, t:hcsatellite service providers can market their product against terrestrial long-haul systems torelatively uneducated users. Users caneasily evaluate howwellthese satellite systems compare withot:her transmission systems, howwellthese satellite systems muet their requirements, andhow w_rious configurations orfactors affect: the performance ofthese satellit., sy.,:cems.
