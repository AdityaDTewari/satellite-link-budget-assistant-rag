The antenna problem was resolved by August 1, 1969, and commercial operations were resumed until a subsequent January 1970 INTELSAT II launch allowed the satellite to be placed in the retired reserve. In April 1970, another successful -INTELSAT III launch supplemented the operational capability available over the Atlantic. An INTELSAT III satellite was first placed into operation over the Pacific in February 1969. This satellite was supplemented by a second spacecraft in May 1969. When the first Pacific INTELSAT III lost 6 dB of transponder gain due to an RF re­ ceive amplifier malfunction, it was relocated over the Indian Ocean where the traffic requirements were lighter. As a result, four INTELSAT HI satellites were, as of May 1971, providing global commercial service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Development of the fourth generation of INTELSAT spacecraft, INTELSAV IV, began in the latter portion of the 1960s. These satellites, manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company, have been designed to provide a substantially greater capability to meet the increased global communication needs of the 1970s. The first, in an expected series of eight satellites, was successfully launched by an Atlas Centaur rocket into a geostationary orbit on January 25, 1971. It was positioned over the Atlantic at 335.5 0 E"}
