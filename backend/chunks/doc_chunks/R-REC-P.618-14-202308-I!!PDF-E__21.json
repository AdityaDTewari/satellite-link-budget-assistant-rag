The rain attenuation vs. annual probability of occurrence can be predicted using the method described in § 2.2.1.1. For each path, the log -normal fit of rain attenuation vs. probability of occurrence is performed as follows: Step 1 : Determine rain kP (% of time), the probability of rain on the k-th path. Step 2 : Construct the set of pairs [ Pi, Ai] where Pi (% of time) is the probability the attenuation Ai (dB) is exceeded where Pi  rain kP . The specific values of Pi should consider the probability range 2 NOTE – This is the same bivariate normal integral used in § 2.2.1.2. An approximation to this integral is available in Z. Drezner and G.O. Wesolowsky. “On the Computation of the Bivariate Normal Integral ”, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation. Vol. 35, 1989, pp. 101 -107. The Matlab statistics toolbox contains the built -in Matlab function ‘ mvncdf ’ that computes the bivariate normal integral, and the Python library contains the built -in function ‘mvndst’ that computes the bivariate normal integral.
