NAT URE OF RESULTS OBTAINED Beacon receives total output power for no communications signal present. Communications input must be varied over several dB to completely sup­ press beacon and capture TT. Determined from poinit of maximum suppression of beacon signal. Good alignment found.' Measured values, ingeneral, agreed-with predicted values. For antennaelevation angles above 7.50, no ielective fading due to multipath existed. Agreed well with predicted values. For 4-kHz channel, baseband response exceeded the requirements of MIL STD 188B for a11,112 km (6000-n.mi.) reference circuit.- For 4-kHz channel, bd-seband response exceeded the requirements of MIL STD 188Bfor a11,112 kn 6000-n.mi.) reference circuit.*. Performed with satellite spin axis in plane of orbit. Pattern shapes agreed wellwith prelaunch measurements and indicated about 1.50 error in meas­ ,ured satellite orientation parameters. Not-performed-on Syncom-Il. Nearly allmeasured degradation was due to AN/TCC-3 and FM modulation/demodulation. Measured frequency agreed with prelaunchmeasurements. 8-14 CITED REFERENCES 1. D. D.
