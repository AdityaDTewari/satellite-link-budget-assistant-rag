In either configuration the Hybrid or Mobile Terminals will contain UHF equipment to support the 860-MHz downlink for the SITE experiment. The Rosman data acquisition facility will be the primary ground station. The two secondary stations, Mojave-and the Hybrid Terminal, will have the same basic capabilities as the primary station with regard to performance and evaluation of space­ craft data. The three stations will have functionally identical communications and 13-81 telemetry and control equipment; 'the principal difference being that the stations have different C-band antennas. The Rosman facility will use a 26-meter (85-fdot) an­ tenna; the Mojave facility will use a 12-meter (40-foot) antenna and the Hybrid/ Mobile Terminal will use a 6.4-meter (21-foot) antenna which contains a UHF feed to provide the UHF receive capability. The millimeter wave experiment unique terminal will be located at the ATS facility at Rosman. All spacecraft maneuvers and experiments are controlled by direction from the ATS Operations Control Center (ATSOCC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. All test data obtained is forwarded from the ground stations to GSFC for processing, evaluation, and distribution to experimenters. 13.4.4.2 Rosman Ground Station(4 1) The Rosman II 26-meter (85-foot) antenna is used by ATS-6 spacecraft for C-band transmission and reception. This high-gain antenna with its feed and low­ noise receiver systems provides a relatively quick conversion from space flight tracking and data network to ATS communications use, and vice versa. This allows the antenna to be shared with other projects. Monopulse tracking techniques can be used to automatically track the spacecraft. Polarization tracking at C-band is also provided. Communication signals are transmitted, received, and processed as re­ quired by the various ATS experiments. In addition, a communications test and eval­ uation console"}
