The word intelligibility versus c/N values reached a maximum of 80 percent in some tests and 90 percent using other terminals. Experiments were performed to determine degree of improved traffic flow in a starnet using automatic control. Functions, such as addressing of members and as­ signment of channels, were performed by a computer installed at the net control station 14-20 in Bedford, Massachusetts. Automatic Net Control units were installed at ground­ based terminals and Eastern Test Range C-i35 aircraft. Although the experiments were considered preliminary and additional work re­ mains, the results showed that automatic polling significantly improved traffic flow in star nets. Experiments with terminals located in Panama were performed to determine the effect of tropical environment, particularly attenuation due to foliage, on UHF and SHI communications. The average attenuation at UHF in foliage was about 8 dB. At SHF no signal acquisition was obtained in the foliage. There were equipment problems di­ rectly related to temperature and humidity. 14.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS One of the objectives of the TACSATCOM program was the support of Apollo mis­ sions. TACSAT 1 was used to support Apollo missions 10 through 13 in the following capacities. 1. Command and control of the Apollo Range Instrumentation Aircraft while enroute and at their staging bases. 2. Astronaut voice relay from the spacecraft to Mission Control Center in Houston during orbit, translunar injection burn, and recovery operations. 3. Following the aircraft transporting the lunar samples to Houston. Recovery ship-to-shore communications. (7 ) 4. High-power UHF ground-based transceivers were used and the aircraft and ships were equipped with TACSAT terminals. Communications during all operational phases were outstanding. In addition, the TACSAT SHE communication band was used to provide satellite relay of live television coverage"}
