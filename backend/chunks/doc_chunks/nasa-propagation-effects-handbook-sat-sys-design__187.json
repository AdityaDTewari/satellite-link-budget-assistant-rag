However,these canberelated byanalysis to corresponding values ofCNR, which communication engineers prefer towork with. There is,usually, along termornominal performance standard, aswell assome definition ofshort termevent behavior (outage criterion). With data systems, thelong andshort term phenomena maybestatistically combined, so that itispossible todefine combined performance criteria. •These similarities, differences, andrelationships areshown inTable 7.2-I. 7.2.5 Additional PerformanceCriteria Insomeapplications, more specific control ofthetransmission quality isnecessaryandcriteria such asthose cited above areinadequate. 361 SystemTable 7.2-1 Performance Criteria andRelationships Fundamental Nominal Short-Term Quality (LongTerm) (Outage) Parameter Performance Criterion Analog Baseband noiseorMeanorMedian CNR CNRequalled or signaltonoise exceeded except forp% Digitized Analog Baseband quality,=_--_ BitError,1----._CNR RateSameasabove Data Errorfreeblock BitError_CNR Outage probability Rate probabilityCombined Criterion Errorfreeblock probability Throughput Delivery Delayi__: •/ i-.L . i',- i Inthese situations anumberoflinear andnonlineardistortionparametersmay bespecified.

Ontheother hand, large phase scintillations that occur infrequently will addtotheoutage time calculation, providing: 1)i these events arenotconcurrent with thepredominant cause of outage, namelyamplitude fades (attenuation), and 2)therate ofphase variation ishigh enough that itwill notbe tracked byadigitalsystem, orbefiltered outinananalog system. *Apossible exception isdispersion atfrequencies near theabsorption bands, butthese bands will usually beavoided. 362 !; :_:7.3 DESIGNPROCEDURE 7.3.1 Introduction Theprocedurepresentedinthis Section isageneral one,applicable tosatellitecommunication systemsofconventional design andapplication.
