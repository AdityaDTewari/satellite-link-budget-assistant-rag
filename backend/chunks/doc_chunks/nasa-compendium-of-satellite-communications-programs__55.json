The communications portion of the project was as­ signed to the U. S. Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, late in July 1958. SCORE was successfully launched by the Air Force on December 18, 1958, thus becoming the first communications satellite. The orbital parameters are given in Table 2-1. Table 2-1. Participating Spacecraft Satellite SCORE Manufacturer/Sponsor U.S. Army, ARPA Launch Date December 18, 1958 Launch Vehicle Atlas 10-B Apogee 1494 km (928 mi.) Perigee 185 km (115 mi.) 0 Inclin. Period 30 deg. 101 min. Status Expected Life of Orbit: 20 days; Actual life of orbit: 35 days; Com­ munications failed December 30, 1958, due to battery failure 2-1 This first satellite communications system functionea for approximately 12 days, achieving its desired goals -to demonstrate the feasibility of an orbital relay that could span intercontinental distances. Among the achievements attained during the experiment were: 1. The first successful relay of teletype signals through an orbiting station. 2. The first successful delayed repeater communication from earth to satellite to another point on earth at a later time. 3. The first successful multichannel teletype transmission by a delayed repeater. 2.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Two complete communications packages were installed in what are normally the guidance pods on the sides of the Atlas missile. Ground equipment installed in army vans with associated support vehicles was located at Fort MacArthur, California; Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Fort Sam Houston, Texas; and Fort Stewart, Georgia. All ground stations were linked by both telephone and HF radio to the system control center at the Signal Corps Laboratory in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The design of the system was based on providing two modes of operation -as a delayed repeater and"}
