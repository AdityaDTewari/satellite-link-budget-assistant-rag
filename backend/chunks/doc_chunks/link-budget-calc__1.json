The access point is connected to an antenna with 10 dBi gain, with a transmitting power of 20 dBm and a receive sensitivity of -89 dBm . The client is connected to an antenna with 14 dBi gain, with a transmitting power of 15 dBm and a receive sensitivity of -82 dBm . The cables in both systems are short, with a loss of 2dB at each side at the 2.4 GHz frequency of operation. AP to Client link 12+10 dBi -2 dB +20 dBm +14 dBi -2 dB -82 dBm ???-114 dB @ 5 km Link budget: AP to Client link 13 20 dBm (TX Power AP) + 10 dBi (AP Antenna Gain) - 2 dB (AP Cable Losses) -114 dB (free space loss @5 km) + 14 dBi (Client Antenna Gain) - 2 dB (Client Cable Losses) -74 dBm (expected received signal leve l) -(-82 dBm) (sensitivity of Client) 8 dB ( link margin ) Opposite direction: Client to AP 14+14 dBi -2 dB +15 dBm +10 dBi -2 dB -89 dBm ???-114 dB @ 5 km Link budget: Client to AP link 15"}
