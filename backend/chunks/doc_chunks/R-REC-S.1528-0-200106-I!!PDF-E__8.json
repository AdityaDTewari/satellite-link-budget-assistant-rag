The three primary roots of the J1 Bessel function are: µ1 = 1.2 µ2 = 2.233 µ3 = 3.238 Rec. ITU-R S.1528 9 In each case, the SLR considered is 20 dB and the number of secondary lobes is four. These two parameters give A = 0.95277 and σ = 1.1692. Lr and Lt are distances on the ground and depend on the beam roll-off (difference between the maximum gain and the gain at the edge of the illuminated beam). The calculation has been performed using roll-off of 7 dB, 5 dB and 3 dB. The L r and Lt input parameters to be used are given in Table 2.
