Prior to each correction, the satellite is oriented in the direction of flight. The change in speed that must be imparted to the satellite for adjusting the period of its orbit by the necessary magnitude is trans­ mitted to a gyroscopic speed-measuring device in the form of a code sent over a command radio link from earth. 11.2.2 Frequencies The frequencies used for Molniya-1 are in the 800- to 1000-MHz band. How­ ever, some of the Molniya-1 satellites also transmitted in the 3400- to 4100-1VIHz. Frequencies for Molniya-2 are found in Table 11-1. The highest numbered channel has been identified for wideband operation. 11.3 'SPACECRAFT Figure 11-6 shows the Molniya-1 communications satellite; Table 11-2 sum­ marizes the principal communication parameters -forMolniya-1 and Molniya-2. Molniya-1 is cylindrical with conical ends, which have a diameter and height df about 2 and 3.0 meters (5 and 10 feet), respectively. Its more apparent features include the six solar cell panels and thd two parabolic communication antennas (one in reserve). Within the hermetically sealed body are the primary transponder (along with the com­ plete spares), an electronic computer for equipment control, a gyrostabilizer, chemi­ cal batteries, and various electronic equipment. Since the spacecraft is gyro, and not spin-stabilized, equipment to regulate internal temperature was required, consisting 11-9 Table 11-1.
