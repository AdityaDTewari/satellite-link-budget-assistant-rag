These parameters areBlock Transfer Time, User Information Bit Transfer Rate, Bit Error Probability, Block Error Probability, BitMisdelivery probability, Block Misdelivery Probability, Extra Bit Probability, Extra Block Probability, Bit Loss Probability, Block Loss Probability, Transfer Denial Probability, User Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time, andUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time (see Table 2).

Theuser _i information transfer function isdefined asfollows: i Theuser information transfer function begins when theaccess function ends. The user information transfer function ends when the last \"disengagement request\" inaparticular data communication session is issued. Itincludes all formatting, transmission, storage, error control, and media conversion activities performed between start of transfer and completion of delivery, including any needed retransmissions within thesystem. Thespeed performance criterion isdescribed bytheBlock Transfer Time and User Information BitTransfer Rate. The Block Transfer Time istheaverage elapsed time between the start ofablock transfer attempt andaSuccessful Block Transfer, i.e., thelength oftime auser information block isintransit between thesource anddestination users. Aswith alltheblock parameters, a block ofuser information maybeanycontiguous stream ofbits that hasmeaning tothe users, e.g., asingle ASCII character (7bits) ora128-byte X.25 packet. The User Information Bit Transfer Rate isthe total number of Successful BitTransfer outcomes inanindividual transfer sample divided by theinput/output time forthat sample (ANSI, 1983). Asshown inFigure 2,the input and output times may bedifferent insome systems (usually packet- switched systems). Thelongest time istaken asthedivisor, thus giving the slower ofthetwopossible rates. The accuracy performance criterion isdescribed bysix ofthebit/block i I performance parameters.
