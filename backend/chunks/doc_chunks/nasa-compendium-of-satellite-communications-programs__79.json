Results of the first three items, as well as optical data, indicated that Echo I was relatively smooth and spherical during its pressurized lifetime but developed wrinkles and flat areas during the first month in orbit, which tended to become more extensive and severe as time passed. Similar data indicated that Echo II developed a wrinkled skin very quickly after deployment and maintained its shape as a function of time. 3-17 Table 3-8.

Echo II was 1 dB down from theoretical shortly after launch and held constant as a function of time.. ( 4 ) 3. Fading Characteristics(1) On Echo 1, 10 to 90 percent fade range was 2 to 4 dB during'firstmonth in orbit and gradually increased to 6 d3 to 8 dB over 3 years. Echo II range was 11 to 13 dB and held constant as a function of time. On both Echo I after 3 years and Echo II, a Rayleigh probability density function and an amplitude spectrum indicating nearly all power fluctuations occurred at frequencids below 3 or 4 iz were observed. 4. Voice Transmission Received quality 3udged excellent on both Echo I and It for voice. Music also excellent on Echo II. Echo I employed 200-Hz to 3-kltz baseband:and frequency deviation of -30 MHz.
