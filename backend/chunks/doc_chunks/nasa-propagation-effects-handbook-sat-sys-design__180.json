B)Consider otherpropagationeffects such ascloud andfog attenuation, signal fluctuations, andantenna gain degradations andaddmargin todesignasnecessary. 9)Adjust system parameters toinclude alladditive margins. Analyze systemperformance, first atthepath level, then onthe end-to-end performance level. 10) Ifperformancemeetsrequirements closely, stop.Otherwise, adjust design andrepeat analysis. Ifdesigncannot bemade to meet requirements, consider changing requirements. Performancecriteria typically dealwith baseband quality, ordigital error rates, whereas thepower budgets relate physical systemparameters to CNR(orequivalents suchasS/N,Eb/No, C/kT, etc.). Therefore, the baseband ordigital performance criteria must befunctionally related toCNR bymeans ofmodulation performance equations. Gross design isperformed bymeans ofelementary power budget analysis andfree-space (orclear air)propagation characteristics. Basic choices aremade atthis point, suchasselection ofmodulation andmultiple access techniques. Itisassumed that thereader isfamiliar with these techniques andpower budget analysis (Northrop-1966). This analysis establishes arelationship between basic system•parameters andthesignal-or carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR)onagiven transmission path. 352 IbThesystem performance requirements, which apply toend-to-end performance, aresuballocated tovarious system components. Most important, therelationship oftheend-to-end communication performance tothat ofeach ofthelinks must bedetermined.

Except for depolarization, these effects aregenerally additive interms ofmargin.
