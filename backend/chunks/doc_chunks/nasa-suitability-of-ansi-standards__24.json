These satellite-switched systems maximize the throughput ofthe 271989010985-037 r........... ............7 as-needed basis, thus reducing thenumber ofpermanently assigned transponders. DAMA systems, such asSatellite Business Systems (SBS) and TELECOM i (Feher, 1983), operate onashort-term orreal-time BTPassignment mode. These demand-assignment systems further enhance the flexibility and throughput of TDMA systems bychanging the system configuration (BTP) i,_tea] time to accommodate changes inthenetwork traffic load. This isaccomplished byusing different preassigned BTPs orgenerating new BTPs inreal time astraffic demands change. From the user's perspective, all TDMA systems operate onaconnection- oriented basis. Once the circuit has been established, the users have full-time access toitand all their information traverses the same path through the system. Detailed information onthe various TDMA network architectures, synchronization techniques andoperation concerns canbefound inFeher (1983). With these advanced communication satellite systems, thelink budget and capacity calculations are still useful tosystem designers and service providers for designing the system. But, these calculations donot fully quantify the system's performance from the user's perspective. Therefore, using ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 becomes very useful forquantifying theend-to- endsystem performance ofthese satellite systems. The following subsection discusses how the 21ANS X3.102 performance parameters relate tothevarious TD_ communication satellite systems. Each performance parameter isexamined and related tospecific system operation events. Table 4lists the performance parameters deemed applicable tothe various TDMA systems discussed. The final selection ofthe performance parameters for quantifying aparticular system isuptotheuser andhis/her specific system performance requirements. However, theend-to-end performance parameters discussed below provide astarting point forquantifying TDMA system performance from the user's perspective and designing system performance experiments around theANSX3.141 framework discussed inSection 2. 3.2.1 Access Access methods andtimes forthevarious TDMA systems differ. User access tothe preassigned TDMA, SS/TDMA, and DAMA systems that switch between preassigned BTPs toaccommodate traffic changes isaccomplished byprior 281989010985-038 scheduling with theTDMA control center.
