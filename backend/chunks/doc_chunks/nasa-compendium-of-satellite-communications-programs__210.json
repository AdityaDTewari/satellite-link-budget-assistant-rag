In addition, one of the trans-. ponder local oscillators exhibited a sudden 1700-Hz shift in frequency in December 9-42 1968. This produced a comparable change in translation frequency. It was hypothesized from ground testing on similar hardware that a capacitor in the LO experienced an abrupt change in value. LES-6 has performed almost exactly as predicted throughout its lifetime except for the output variations due to the spin modulation on the dc power"}
