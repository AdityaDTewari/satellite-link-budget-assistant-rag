For this experiment, a ground-based computer is programmed to put ATS-6 through a series of attitude maneuvers utilizing the spacecraft's Radio Frequency 13-123 Interferometer, the Attitude Control System, and the Spacecraft Propulsion System. These include precision pointing to fixed targets, slewing between targets, tracking of moving targets, and the generation of prescribed ground tracks. This experiment is expected to lay the necessary foundation for the development of future ground-based spacecraft control systems which would perform many of the essential functions now performed onboard the spacecraft. As a result, reliability could be improved because the ground-base systems could be repaired, or replaced in case of malfunction. Further, the weight and space savings resulting from smaller onboard control systems could be used for redundant or improved power and sensor systems. Future ground-based control systems could provide more versatility in that new tasks could be programmed and performed as requirements or technology changed. Principal Investigator: William C. Isley, Goddard Space Flight Center. 13.4.5.15 Radio Beacon This international experiment is designed to provide data for studies of the effects of particles on radio signal propagation beyond the earth's atmosphere. Such investigations not only increase man's scientific knowledge about the space environ- - I' ment, but provide designers with vital data nec- ,- .. essary for the development of new communications - systems. RADIO BEACON. This experiment will investigate ionospheric particles which affect radio propagation beyond the atmosphere. The Radio Beacon experiment package, con- rained in the EVM consists of a low-power, three-Data for the radio beacon will be collected by small ground stations at various geographical locations. With the radio beacon in geosta­ tionary orbit aboard ATS-F, measurements can be made from a position where the influence of frequency transmitter and an array of whip the magnetosphere and"}
