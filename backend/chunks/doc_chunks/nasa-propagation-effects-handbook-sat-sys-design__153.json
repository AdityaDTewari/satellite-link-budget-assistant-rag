Paths operating atvery lowelevation angles with narrow beamwidth antennas mayexperience unacceptable fading dueto scintillation andmultipath effects. Therequired reliability mayberegained bytheuseofspaced site diversity. Asite separation greater than 300m transverse tothepropagation path hasbeen suggested (CCIR-1978, Rpt564-1) asnecessary toalleviate severe turbulence-induced effects. Ineffect, separation ontheorder oforlarger than thescale size ofthelargest inhomogeneities inrefractive index along thepropagation path, andespecially near thesurface where refraction isgreatest, results indecorrelation ofthe instantaneous signal fluctuations andhence improved performance. Theaperture effectsoflarge antennasmaybecircumventedifseveli phase-locked antennas, each with relatively wide beamwidth, areemployed inan array toachieve thedesiredsystem gain. Ofcourse, overall fade margins will beontheorder ofthat forasingle element, butangle-of-arrival effects areeliminated.
