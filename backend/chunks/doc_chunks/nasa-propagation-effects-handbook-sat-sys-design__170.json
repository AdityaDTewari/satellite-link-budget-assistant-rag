This isdonewith asun-tracking radiometer, which monitors the noise temperature ofanantenna that isdevised toautomatically remain pointed atthesun. 6.8.4.2.2 Lunar Noise. Themoon reflects solar radio energy back tothe Earth. Itsapparent size isapproximately i/2degree indiameter, likethe sun.. Thenoise power flux density from themoon varies directly asthesquare offrequency, which ischaracteristic ofradiation from a\"black body.\" The power flux densityfrom thefull moon isabout -202 dBW/Hz-m 2at20GHz. Themaximum antenna temperature increase duetothemoon, forthe20GHz2m antenna considered earlier, would beonly about 320K. Because ofthe'phases ofthemoon andtheellipticity ofitsorbit,theapparent size andflux vary widely, butinaregular andpredictable manner. Themoon hasbeen used in measuring Earth station G/T(Johannsen andKoury-1974). 6.8.4.2.3Radio Stars. Thestrongestradio starsaretentimes weaker than thelunar emission. Thestrongeststars(Wait, etal-1974)emit typically -230 dBW/Hz-m2inthe10to100GRzfrequency range. Three of these strong sourcesareCassiopeia A,Taurus AandOrion A.These sources aresometimes utilized forcalibration oftheground stationG/T. During the Calibrations theattenuation duetothetroposphere isusually cancelled out bycomparing theskynoise onthestar andsubtractingtheadjacent (dark) sky noise. Thus theattenuation-induced skynoise cancels out. 6.8.5 Noise ObservedbySatellite-Borne Receivers Receiving(uplink)antennas aboard spacecraftObservethewarm earth ortheearth's cloud cover. This represents anoisesourcecompeting with the uplink signal from theground station. 339 Thenoise temperature ofthereceive antenna, when theEarth fills itsbeam, isincreased byanamount equal totheradiation efficiency ofthe antenna times theaverage brightness temperature seen inthepattern. Measurements ofthebrightness temperature oftheearth measured with the electrically-scanned microwave radiometer aboard Nimbus-5 at19.35 GHzhave demonstrated brightness temperature differences of160Kwhen comparing water (130K) andland (290K) (Webster, etal-lg75). Clouds appear tohave a temperature near 270K (O°C). Intheabsence ofclouds, afull earth coverage antenna will observe, ontheaverage, about 130(0.8)+290(0.2)=164k. With a50%cloud coverage, theantenna noise temperature would beincreased by approximately 164(0.5)+270(0.5)=217K. \"However, when observing atemperate zone groundstation inanarrow beam, a300K brightness temperature isnot uncommon.!. 6.9REFERENCES Ahmed, I.Y. andL.J.
