This technique is restricted, however, by depolarization on atmospheric propagation paths. Various depolarization mechanisms, es pecially hydrometeor effects, are important in the troposphere. Faraday rotation of the plane of polarization by the ionosphere is discussed in Recommendation ITU-R P.531. As much as 1° of rotation may be encountered at 10 GHz, and greater rotations at lower frequencies. As seen from the earth station, the planes of po larization rotate in the same direction on the up - and down -links. It is therefore not possible to compensate for Faraday rotation by rotating the feed system of the antenna, if the same antenna is used both for transmitting and receiving. 4.1 Calculation of long -term statistics of hydrometeor -induced cross -polarization To calculate long -term statistics of depolarization from rain attenuation statistics the following parameters are needed: Ap : rain attenuation (dB) exceeded for the required percentage of time, p, for the path in question, commonly called co -polar attenuation (CPA)  : tilt angle of the linearly polarized electric field vector with respect to the horizontal (for circular polarization use  = 45°) f : frequency (GHz)  : path elevation angle (degrees). Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 25 The method described below to calculate cross -polarization discrimination (XPD) statistics from rain attenuation statistics for the same path is valid for 6  f  55 GHz and   60°. The procedure for scaling to frequencies down to 4 GHz is given in § 4.3 (and see Step 8 below).
