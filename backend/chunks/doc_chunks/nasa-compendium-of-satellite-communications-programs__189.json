The satellite's onboard cold ammonia thruster system was used for final adjustment'intoa Istationary orbit with the spacecraft positioned at about 860 West -longitude(2 8 ). OV2-5 and OV5-2 were launched to collect data on the space radiation environment white OV5-4 provided 9-22 an experiment on heat transfer in a liquid und6r zero-g conditions. LES-6 and the ground terminals operating with it provided experiments aimed at'meeting all of the objectives listed in Table 9-10. Shortly after orbital injection it was observed that the satellite was spinning about an axis offset about 2. 2* from the axis of symmetry of the cylinder (i. e., nutating). Additionally one solar panel, lying in the plane defined by the actual spin axis and the axis of symmetry, was providing a severely reduced power output ( 2 9 ) The exact cause of these seemingly related difficulties was not determined. It was hypothesized that the satellite unbalance and resultant spin axis offset was produced by about 0. 5 kilograms (1.1 pounds) of weight added to the outside surface of the cylinder. One theory suggested that an object was caught on a'dipole antenna and was shadowing the solar panel. The net effect was to make the automatic attitude control system unusable and produce a spin rate modulation of the solar array de power out­ put that resulted in a similar modulation of the RF power output. A further difficulty was encountered about a week after launch when a relay flip flop failed in the Earth Position register of one of the satellite's two antenna (29)switching logic systems . However, the second switching logic system remained in good working order and was able to successfully handle antenna switching except during"}
