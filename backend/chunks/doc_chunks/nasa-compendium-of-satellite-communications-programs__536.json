Four spacecraft remain from this procurement and a major redesign activity was started to ensure that these spacecraft would operate properly. This redesign 17-25 included balancing of the despun platform and a major change in the power distribution. The redesign has been completed and the next two of the DSCS spacecraft were launched on 13 December 1973. ,,(1) The two satellites of the December 1973 launch underwent evaluation during January and February of 1974 and were placed into operation in March 1974.(2) A typical multilink configuration is shown in Figure 17-2. At least three satellites are needed to provide the global coverage dictated by military requirements. A third DSCS Phase 11 dual satellite launch is scheduled for the first half of 1975, which if successful would make such coverage possible. 17-26 CITED REFERENCES 1. V. W.
