The higher the gain, the less the interacting effect. Generally speaking, antennas available to the user spacecraft designer can be separated into two distinct categories, that is, medium and low gain designs. The associated design problems and required system trades are in many respects different and can be discussed separately for these two separate classes of antennas. The medium gain antennas, ranging in gains of about 10-15 dB, must usually be mechanically steered in order to keep the beam pointed at the TDRS because they have narrow beamwidths. In these ranges of antenna gain, there is a lower tendency for the pattern to be affected by the spacecraft structure as compared to the lower gain antennas. For the lower gain a:tennas, falling in the range of gains of 2-5 dB, generally the opposite is true. Because of their relatively broad beamwidths, it may not be necessary to steer the elements continuously to keep the beam pointed toward the TDRS. Along with this advantage, however, comes the disadvantage of having lower discriminating protection against unwanted RFI arriving via the antenna radiation pattern side and back lobes. Furthermore, the structural integration of their elements into an overall spacecraft structural design is rendered difficult because of the afore- mentioned effect of basic :pattern interaction with the structure. When a low gain antenna is put on a satellite structure several variables modify the basic antenna radiation pattern (the intrinsic pattern in absence of the satellite body). The two most signfiicant variables are the antenna size versus the satellite structure size. The curve illustrated in Figure 4.2 shows a typical test result from NRL test analysis(6) of spacecraft interaction"}
