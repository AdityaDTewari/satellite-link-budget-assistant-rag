Since the cellscanbeconsideredtoberelatively uniformcolumnsofrain,several kmhigh, acommunication pathmight intercept one ormore ofthesecellsdependingonorientation. Similarly asetofS-band radar datafromOttawa during1970 (Strickland, 1974a) was analyzedstatistically todetermine cellsizedistributions andjoint probabilities ofoccurrence asafunction oftwo path separation dis- tance. These resultsshowed that 80%ofthe cellshad asize Treater than2km, 50%exceededabout 6km, and20% exceeded 14kmextents for an attenuation level criterionof5dB.The attenuations were calculatedfor 15.5 GHzandcomparedwith satellite (ATS-5) measurements. The cell separation statistics were distancesofabout15, 30and45kmforthe threepercentages ofoccurrence exceeded. Recent measurements from Goodland, Kansas (Crane, 1979) have yielded (5dBdown reflectivity) cell diametersofabout 2.5kmwith cellseparations of5to6kmfor all cellsand10to12kmfor significant cell.Storm sizes of30to60km inlength andI0to20kminwidth aretypically observed nominally agree- ingwith the Ottawa observations. Given two (ormore) propagation paths, thediversitygain, G,is defined(Hedge, 1974) asthe difference indBbetween the rainattenua- tion(A)onasingle path andthat obtained jointlywith diversitypaths (Adiv) ataspecified percentage oftime exceeded. Thediversitygain istherefore afunction ofthe specified level ofpercentage oftimethe single path attenuation (orfadedepth) isexceeded.
