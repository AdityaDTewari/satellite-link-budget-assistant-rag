Generally, there is a threshold below the performance of the communication system is unacceptable. In digital communication systems, the bit error rate of the system often becomes unacceptably high (according to the promised performance by a communication system) below a certain SNR. We have employed link budgets to predict the received power in a communication system. A natural evolution to a link budget to adapt it to determine the received SNR. In this course we have focused on narrowband radio systems where a sinusoidal signal is assumed. In practise, the sinusoid acts as a carrier for the information signal, which is the true \\signal\". Hence, strictly speaking, the SNR refers to this power of the recovered signal power to noise power. We will use the term carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) to refer to the received carrier power. Here, we will use the symbol cto refer to the received carrier power and nto the noise power. Friis' formula can be written as C=EIRP\u0012\u0015 4\u0019r\u00132Gr l wherelis other losses over and above the free-space loss, and EIRP has been de ned previously as the product of the transmit power and transmit gain (e ective radiated isotropic power). It could be polarization loss factor, impedance mismatch loss, di raction loss, plane-earth re ection loss, etc. including a combination of these e ects. The carrier-to-noise power ratio is found by setting N=kTSB: C N=EIRP\u0012\u0015 4\u0019r\u00132Gr lkTSB It is common to represent the CNR over 1 Hz of signal bandwidth ( B= 1 Hz), so that the resulting expression can simply divided by the bandwidth to get the ratio: C N0=EIRP\u0012\u0015 4\u0019r\u001321"}
