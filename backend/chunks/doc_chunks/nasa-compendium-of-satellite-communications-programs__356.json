ATS-1 also gave real-time data support to the ground stations operating with INTELSAT II and to OGO-IV and OSO-IV satellites. (40) Educational broadcasting to both Alaska and the Pacific Basin is currently being done through ATS-1. Included are college-level seminars and courses at both primary and secondary levels. 13,-29­ ATS-1 will be used in conjunction with ATS-6 for the Alaska ATS-6 Education Telecommunications Experiment and in the ATS-6 Health Experiments conducted in Alaska. (42) 13.2.6.2 Additional Services ATS-3 ATS-3 performed many services in addition to the technological and scientific ex­ periments. Some of these services included support of the Apollo missions; TV cover­ age of Pope Paul's visit to Bogota, Columbia; special SIF tests such as the IEEE International Communication Conference; VHF relay of special commands to ATS-4 from Johannesburg; demonstration of automatic picture transmission at NASA head­ quarters by the weather facsimile (WEFAX) experiment on board the ATS-3; real-time data support of the OSO-IV satellite; and provided an RF collimation source for the Canadians. (40) Through a series of maritime experiments, involving both ship position location and ship-to-shore communications through the spacecraft, ATS-3 has demonstrated that major improvements .in the management of shipping fleets can be made by use of the capabilities of synchronous-orbit communications satellites. ATS-3 will be used in conjunction with ATS-6 in Health-Education Telecommuni­ (42)cations Experiment for both the Rocky Mountain area and the Appalachian Region. 13-30 13.3 GRAVITY GRADIENT STABILIZED SATELLITES' 13.3.1 General Description The experiments carried on the Application Technology Satellites that featured evaluations of gravity gradient stabilization can be grouped into six major categories.
