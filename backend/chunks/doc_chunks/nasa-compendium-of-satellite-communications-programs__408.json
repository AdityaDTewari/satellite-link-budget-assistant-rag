ATS-F will beam Educational Television programming direct to unique, low-cost receiving stations located in or near school­ houses or community buildings in isolated regions of Alaska and the * Alaska ATS-6 Educational Rocky'Mountains where terrestrial TV coverage is not'feasible. ETV transmission will utilize S-band frequency and localized one-degreeTelecommunications Experi- beam-width spot-beams The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are cooperating with NASA in the experiment. (39)ment- Each of the projects explores how to convey educational information; but in dif­ ferent ways. In Appalachia, elementary and secondary-school teachers will receive in-service courses in career education and the teaching of elementary reading. They will also be able to request and receive specialized reference information via satel­ lite. In the Rocky Mountains, junior-high students will have a'wcourse in career education, and adults will have some evening programs on topics of interest to them. Also, teachers in that area, instead of having to. order videotaped materials for their classes months or weeks in advance, will be able to order those materials in a large number of subjects from a videotape collection in Denver and to receive those materials quickly via satellite. In Alaska, people who live in villages that can be reached only by airplane, and then only when the weather is good, will have a chance to learn about other people and cultures in their State."}
