Link Budget Analysis: Getting Started 1.A Link Budget analysis determines if there is enough signal power at the receiver to recover the information transmitted to it with acceptable fidelity so the received signal can be used. A.The sum of gains and losses in various parts of the system has to result in satisfactory performance (typically, output S/N or BER). 2.The design of any communication link is based on: A.Meeting of minimum C/N ratio for a specific percentage of time. B.Carrying the maximum revenue earning traffic at minimum cost. 3.Link-power budget calculations take into account all the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the propagation medium to the receiver in a communication system. Also taken into the account are the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, and the loss or gain due to the antenna. Link calculations often determine the maximum distance at which a transmitter and receiver can successfully operate.
