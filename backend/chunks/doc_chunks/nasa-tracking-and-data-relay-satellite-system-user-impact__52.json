Two values of transmitter power will subsequently be assumed for purposes of illus- trating antenna gain versus data rate: 1 watt and-5 watts delivered to the antenna terminals. Although the Statement of Work for the study specified a user transmitter power of 1 watt, it is not unreasonable to assume that some users can deliver 5 watts of RF power to the antenna terminals. 5-1 5.1.3 TDRS Antenna Gain and User Receiving System Noise Temperature The TDRS S-band antenna gain over field of view of 260 is taken as 28 dB. This value was specified at a meeting with the User Impact Study Project Office. (3)' The meeting also resulted in specifi- cation of the user receiving system noise temperature of 1500 K. 5.1.4 TDRS Receiving System Noise Temperature A value of 540 K receiving system noise temperature for the TDRS has been assumed. This value is believed to be in consonance modern S-band receiver front-end technology using bipolar transistors. The re- sultant receiving noise power density at the TDRS is -201.3 dBw/Hz-K. 5.1.5 Bit Energy to Noise Density Ratio For the forward link, with a probability of bit error of -510-5 and phase shift keying, a theoretical bit energy to noise density"}
