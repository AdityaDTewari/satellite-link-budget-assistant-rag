About 3dB maximum fade, with a period of about 3.5 seconds, observed at elevation angle to the satellite less than five degrees. When using blade antenna modem lost lock dur­ 2ng 360-degree turns and with aircraft heading directly away from sub-satellite point. Using reference data base antenna system gain vs. elevation angle was calculated for the two onboard antennas. Unexpectedly poor performance was noted during several of the runs using the satellite relay. No, results are report­ ed for tests using the satellite. Back­ to-back tests which eliminate on-orbit signal fluctuation, intermodulation, and possibly interference were perfor­ med. They gave information on limita­tions in use of address codes to pre­vent false acquisition and maintain adequate link margin. The 1-MHZ satellite bandwidth was used with carriers spaced 505kHz apart. This resulted in spectrum overlap and test results showed that the present system will not support 6-channel PCM. 14-18 Successful communications were maintained during typical maneuvers such as helicopter operations from a ship, destroyer maneuvers, aircraft launch and recovery operations aboard a carrier, and orbit of a C-130 aircraft. The FM voice mode was of high quality and very reliable. Secure digitized voice was more cumbersome and less reliable and intelligible than FM voice, but provided a high level of security. Secure teletype communication was excellent, provided synchronization was achieved. The probability of achieving synchronization was not as high as desired, due to some incompatibility between.the TATS modem and the cryptographic equipment. The tele­ type mode was considered the most useful because of the large number of simultaneous accesses and security. Complete random access to the satellite repeater is complicated by the necessity to control the uplink power of the users. Joint Service Monitor/Control experiments were performed to determine tradeoffs involved between a system that is too costly"}
