Thus, AT&T has proposed to withdraw one of its original applications (the Los Angeles terminal) and GSAT has pro­ posed to withdraw two of its original applications (the New York and Chicago terminals). The AT&T and GSAT terminals will have paraboloid antennas 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter. The characteristics of these earth terminals are summarized in Table 20-3. A drawing of the GSAT terminal antenna is shown in Figure 20-9 and a functional block diagram of the GSAT station is shown in Figure 20-10. The one-for-two redundancy of the cooled paramp and one-for-one redundnacy of the power amplifiers are typical for such stations. A functional block diagram of the AT&T earth station is shown in Fig­ ure 20-11. 20.3.5 Operational Results The AT&T/Comsat General/GSAT Domsat system is not operational. The first satellite for this system, Comstar I, is scheduled to be launched in early 1976. 20-10 Figure 20-5.
