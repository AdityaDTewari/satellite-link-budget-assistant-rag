The solar array output on LES-1 had degraded significantly by September of 1965 due to the satellite being left in a circular orbit within the Van Allen Belt(19) With LES-2 being in an elliptical orbit having an apogee out of the area of severe Van Allen Belt radiation, its solar array did not show significant degradation until mid 1966(6). Even then the difficulties were not severe enough to impair transponder or telemetry operation. The Lincoln Experimental Terminals provided generally reliable performance. One significant initial difficulty was due to the installation of the general purpose computer. Its inclusion resulted in certain equipment malfunctions being difficult to localize because \"everything was so connected. 11(9) When this became clear, special troubleshooting programs and techniques were designed. With these techniques, the computer became an asset since it could test all interconnecting equipment. 9.3 UHF SATELLITES 9.3.1 General Description On October 2, 1965 a Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum titled \"Tactical Satellite Communications Research and Development\" inaugurated the U.S. military's TACSATCOM experimental program. This memorandum instructed the military departments to initiate studies in R&D to hasten the use of satellite repeaters for tactical communications. Experiments with the UHF Lincoln Experimental Satellites 9-18 Table 9-9. SatelliteSystem Performance Experiments TYPE EXPERIMENT 1) FM Voice & Music 2) Vocoded Voice & TTY (Full duplex) 3) Vocoded Voice &TTY (Pull duplex) 4) Interference Sensitivity 5) Frequency Spread vs. Processing Threshold 6) Vocoder Performance 7) Vulnerability to Intelligent Hostile Jamming Notes: * Deviations caused by: NATURE OF RESULTS OBTAINED Monostatic plus half and full duplex bistatic tests conducted by Camp Parks and Millstone Hill (West Ford). Quality was excellent. 'LET-i conducted tests. Transmitter power necessary to attain receiver threshold measured as function of satellite range. Measured values generally agreed* with"}
