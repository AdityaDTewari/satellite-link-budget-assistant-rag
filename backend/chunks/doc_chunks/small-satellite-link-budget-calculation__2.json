Theoretically, using two orthogonal polarizations, radio-link capacity can be the double, but a crosspolarization interference can appear in the reception Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 12/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsFriis formula Antennas Polarization Propagation Recommendation ITU-R P.618-12 Propagation data and prediction methods required for the design of Earth-space telecommunication systems In the design of Earth-space links"}
