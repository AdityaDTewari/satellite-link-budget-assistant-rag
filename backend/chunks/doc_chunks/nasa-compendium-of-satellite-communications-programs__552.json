The tracking, telemetry, and command facilities required for Telesat missions are at three locations: the Allan Park station in Ontario, the Lake Cowichan station on Vancouver Island, and the island of Guam in the Pacific. The latter is a tracking sta­ tion which is used only during the transfer orbit phase of a mission. All TT&C activi­ ties are controlled from Telesat's Satellite Control Centre in Ottawa. 18.4 GROUND TERMINALS The five types of fixed ground terminals for the Telesat program are 1. Multi-purpose communications facilities--Heavy Route (HR) 2. Main television receive and transmit--Network Television (NTV) 3. Message and television receive--Northern Telecommunications (NTC) 4. Television receive--Remote Television (RTV) 5. Message--Thin Route (TR) In addition, Telesat is implementing a transportable television transmit station and a transportable message station. The capacity of each RF channel on a Telesat satellite is such that it is capable of supporting up to 960 on'e-way voice circuits, or one color television video signal with two 5 KHz audio circuits and one cue and control circuit. When the accessing earth stations have a G/T of 37.5 dB/°K, such as with the Heavy Route stations, the voice circuit noise performance for a 960 channel carrier is 37.5 dBrncO.
