Its combined outputs will be amplified and retransmitted at 4. 150 GHz ± 20 MHz. The transponder consists of redundant 13- and 18-GHz frequency translators, two bandpass filters, a combiner hybrid, two 3-stage tunnel diode ampli­ fiers, and two traveling-wave-tube amplifiers. The transponder has been delivered to NASA and is installed in the spacecraft. The receiving terminal will be located at Andover, Maine, and will consist of the horn antenna, a low-noise amplifier, a calibration unit, and a down-converter unit,. and will receive amplify, and convert the signals to the 70-MHz range. The converted signals will be processed and converted to DC voltages which are propor­ tional to the input power of the received carrier signal. These signals will be scanned and applied to the data acquisition section which calculates the power of each carrier signal and records it on magnetic tape. These magnetic tape recordings can be processed on any large computer and displayed on a teletypewriter to permit a sta­ tistical comparison between the measured attenuation at a site and general meteoro­ logical parameters such as rainfall rate, number of thunderstorm days, and total precipitation. The data analysis will be performed at COMSAT Labs.

For this experiment, a ground-based computer is programmed to put ATS-6 through a series of attitude maneuvers utilizing the spacecraft's Radio Frequency 13-123 Interferometer, the Attitude Control System, and the Spacecraft Propulsion System. These include precision pointing to fixed targets, slewing between targets, tracking"}
