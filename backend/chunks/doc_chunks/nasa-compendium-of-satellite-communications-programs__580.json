Each of these innovations represents significant application of current technology. The ground segment of the CTS project also represents a significant application of current technology. The primary experimental program calls for the use of a low cost TV transmission station equipped with a 3.0-m (10-ft) dish to broadcast from re­ mote areas, and the use of remote TV receivers. The demonstration of the economic feasibility of such services may herald new educational opportunities for those citizens inhabiting the remote areas of both the United States and Canada. 19.2 SPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION Spacecraft characteristics for the CTS are displayed in Table 19-1. The re­ maining portions of this section are devoted to an elaboration of the significant features of the various subsystems. 19-2 Table 19-1.
