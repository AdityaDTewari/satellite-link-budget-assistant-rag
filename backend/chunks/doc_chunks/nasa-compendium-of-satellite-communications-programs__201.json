BW2 =3D kHz) LOCALOSCILLATOR LOCAL.OSCILLATOR­ (CM2 MHz) N (I 6MHA Figure 9-6. LES-5 Transponder Block Diagram carried no solar cells. The antenna system produced a toroidal pattern with a measured gain of 4-1/4 dB in the direction perpendicularto the spin axis. The spacecraft weighed approximately 15 kilograms (22 pounds). LES-5 provided, in addition to the features indicated in Table 9-15, a solar cell degradation experiment, an RF interference experiment, and experimental switching logic for antenna despinning although no actual antenna switching was performed (21 ) . The solar cell experiment included measurements on two 10-ohm em. silicon cells with 30-ril. cover slides, one 10-ohm cm. silicon cell with 6-nil. cover slide, and two CdS thin film cells(3 ). The satellite RFI receiver had a 120­ lCHz noise bandwidth and was designed to tune from.283 MHz to 253 MHz in 256 steps of approximately 120 KHz each, dwelling at each step for 2.56 seconds ( 4 3 ). The time for a complete frequency scan was approximately 11 minutes. In the fixed 9-33 frequency modes, the RFI instrument also functioned as the command receiver for the spacecraft. The onboard experimental switching logic was included to obtain data for the design of the despun antenna system flown on LES-6. LES-6 provided, in addition to the features indicated in Table 9-15, a solar cell degradation experiment, space radiation environment measurements, an earth albedo experiment, an RF interference experiment, precision spin period measurements, and a communications transmitter making highly efficient use of available dc power (2 1 ) . The solar cell experiment studied radiation effects pertinent to solar power arrays made from the standard silicon cells normally used and effects on experimental cells of various types. The latter included lithium-doped cells made from silicon grown by crucible,"}
