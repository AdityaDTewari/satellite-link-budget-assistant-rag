The 'L-Band frequen6ies are of interest for aircraft control, navigation, and communications. The VHF fre­ quencies are also commonly considered for this purpose since they are compatible with existing equipment. L-Band offers the potential of more accurate satellite ranging and wider bandwidths for multiple access communications and control. Table 13-21. Millimeter Wave and L7Band Frequencies (GHz) Millimeter Wave L-Band , Uplink Downlink Uplink Downlink 31.65 15.3 1.65 1.55 The basic signal processing techniques employed-for C-Band tests were the same as used in ATS-1 and ATS-3 tests (see Tables 13-7 and 13-8).. The millimeter wave experiment provided two complete and independent propagation measurement links. Similar signal processing techniques were employed on each link. It basi­ cally consisted of modulating a carrier with a single tone such that a carrier and first order upper and lower sidebands all of equal -level are produced. This was accomplished by a varactor phase modulator in the satellite and a varactor frequency upconverter, which was capable of AM, FM, or PM modulation, in the rground:trans­ mitter. For the uplink, sidebands could be set at + 1. 0, +10, or + 50 MHz from the 31.65 Glz carrier. For the downlink, settings of + 0.1, +1 .0, + 10 or + 50 MHz from the 15.3 GHz carrier were possible (34) Receivers employed down conversion mixing, filtering, envelope detectors, and phase detectors to"}
