After ATS-F has been in orbit communications spacecraft in conjunc- -one year, the spacecraft wilt be moved from its original position at 94 degrees, west longitude to 35 degrees east-longitude. Thrusters wlocated on.the truss structure will propel it to a new location at a rate tion with low-cost ground terminals, of 45 feet per second There it will transmit instructional material designed to improve occupational skills, increase food producton, assist in family planning, improve health and hygiene and train NASA responsibilities for this ex- teachers. A ground station at Ahmedabad, India, will transmit pro­ grams'at C-bandto ATS-F, which will relay video and voice signals periment include provision of adequate via UHF to a network of some 3,000 inexpensive community receivers in rural and remote villhges (39) operating time on ATS-6 1s communications transponder as-Well as positioning and pointing of the spacecraft from the ATS mobile ground station near Madrid, Spain. All other aspects of the experiment, including the design, development, and mainte­ nance of the ground transmitting and receiving stations and all programming, are the responsibility of India. India's Space Research Organization (ISRO) is producing all the hardware, while All India Radio (AIR), of the India Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, has prime responsibility to develop the programming.. This experiment will begin approximately one year after launch, when NASA will move ATS-6 to 35 degrees east longitude over the equator, a position over the eastern edge of Lake Victoria in Kenya, East Africa. Requirihig about 45 days, this maneuver will place the spacecraft in a position where it will be \"visible\" to the Indian subcontinent, yet remain in communications view of Madrid for control pur­ poses. Programs will be transmitted 4 hours a day for 1 year from the primary Indian ground station in Ahmedabad or the secondary station"}
