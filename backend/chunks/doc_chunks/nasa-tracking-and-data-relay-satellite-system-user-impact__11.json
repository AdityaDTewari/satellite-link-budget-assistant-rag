It is assumed that mutual visibility exists when a TDRS falls within the antenna beam of the user satellite. The TDRS space- craft have been taken to be in geosynchronous orbits. The coverage and visibility analysis in this section is valid regardless of actual TDRS longitudinal position as long as a constant separation between the two TDRS's is maintained. For purposes of this analysis, a separation of 1160 has been assumed. Analysis of the NASA '78, '79, '80 mission models (Appendix A) shows that the TDRSS users have predominately low altitude circular orbits with inclinations of 330 and 990. Beamwidths ranging from 300 to 1000 have been used in the analysis, which is consistent with the frequencies and antenna sizes considered here. Three cases have been investigated: 1) No gimballing of the antenna 2) ± 900 gimballing of the antenna about an axis parallel to the orbit normal direction 3) Gimballing of the antenna through the maximum possible gimbal angle ±a as defined in Figure 3.1. For each case noted the task can be described as follows: For a particular user orbital inclination, altitude and antenna beamwidth, calculate the maximum and minimum communication time between the user and one or both TDRS for a revolution of the user's orbit. The duration of communication is then defined as the sum of all periods of mutual visibility taking place within the span of one orbital period of the user spacecraft. Several revolutions of the user's orbit are examined to determine the true maximum and minimum values of total visibility time. For convenience the results are expressed in terms of a percentage of the orbital period."}
