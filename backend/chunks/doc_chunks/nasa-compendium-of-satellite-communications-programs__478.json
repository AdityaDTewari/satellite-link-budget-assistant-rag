The U.S. intended to devote the first year of IDSCS to testing, and the U.K. was invited to participate in the test phase. The U.K. program to participate in the IDSCS testing consisted of building five earth stations and work began on these stations in 1965. Three, with 12-meter (40-foot) dishes, were designed by Marconi, Ltd., to have an operational capability within the SKYNET program. The fourth was designed and developed by the Admirality Surface Weapons Establishment. This terminal was entirely experimental to test and confirm the basic design requirements for shipborne terminals. The fifth station ­ a mobile land terminal -was built by the Signals Research and Development Estab­ lishment. This terminal was also an experimental tool. The first Marconi station was completed in the middle of 1966, and the other four stations were all working and participating in testing before the end of that year. During the testing a large number of R&D tests -typically, measurements of propaga­ tion conditions, path loss, earth station performance, and experiments on advanced modulation techniques -were accomplished to aid in the design of the SKYNET System. In 1966 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the U.K. and the U.S. whereby the U.S. would build and launch two satellites required by the SKYNET Program. Philco-Ford was to build the satellites and the USAF Space and Missile System Organization (SAMSO), with technical support from the Aerospace Corpora­ tion, was to act as the procurement agent for the U.K. 15-1 Two satellites were to be launched in 1969-70, with one satellite acting as a backup for the other to provide a 5-year system capability. SKYNET I \"A\" was suc­ cessfully launched into synchronous orbit in November 1969. SKYNET I \"B\" was launched in August 1970 and was a total loss"}
