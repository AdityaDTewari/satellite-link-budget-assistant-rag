The transmitter has continued to perform properly as solar array output has varied with the season of the year and satellite lifetime in orbit. 9-40 Automatic attitude control systems were included on both LE S-5 and LES-6. Their principal of operation was basically the same. They measured latitude, of the satellite-earth line, relative to the satellite's equatorial plane at points 900 apart in ( 2 1 ) (4 6) . the orbit, providing a good view of both the sunlit earth and the sun By positioning the measurements 90* apart, X and Y axes of correction were established. In making a limited number of measurements it was assumed that the satellite attitude did not change greatly between measuring points. Proper orbital measurements points were determined by the coincidence, of pulses from specially positioned earth and sun sensors. Knowledge of the satellite spin rate, as determined from sun sensor measurements, and X and-Y axis errors allowed corrections to be triggered at the appropriate points during every satellite rotation. The LES-5 attitude control system employed only magnetic torquing for corrections and operated correctly in spite of the failure of. one of its four sun sensors. The effect of the failure was to reduce the rate of attitude correction but (2 1 )not its overall accuracy . The system demonstrated a capability of keeping the spin axis within 2.60 of normal to the orbital plane (4 6 ) . iThe LES-6 system provided either magnetic or cold ammqnia gas.thruster corrective torquing and was designed (21)to maintain attitude within 0.16' when the gas thruster system wasemployed The LES-6 system could not be operated when.the satellite spin axis was found (immediately after launch) to be offset 2.20 from the axis of symmetry of the"}
