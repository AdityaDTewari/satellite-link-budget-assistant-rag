(42) The R&RR system uses a series of tones to modulate an RF carrier; the modu­ lated carrier is transmitted from the ground station to ATS-6, then down to Nimbus, up to ATS-6, and then back down to the ground station. The phase delay and doppler shift of the returning signal yields the total four-way range and cumulative range rate over the signal path from which the orbit of Nimbus can be determined. The trans­ mission link between the ATS spacecraft and the ground is at C-Band; between the ATS and Nimbus spacecraft S-Band signals are employed. (44) _ T&DRE design objectives for uncertainties in raw tracking data are 4.0 meters in range and 0.6 centimeters/s in range rate. Based on the availability of long-arc tracking data, studies have shown that it should be possible to determine the Nimbus orbit to within 50. meters in a total elapsed time of several hours. This constitutes a substantial improvement over ground-based tracking systems which typically require days and weeks of data processing to determine orbits which at best are known only to within hundreds of meters. Verification of these theoretical studies is considered the major scientific and application goal of the T&DRE. (44) Figure 13-29 illustrates this experiment.

Consequently, the orbit of this spacecraft can be determined -with high precision for geodetic purposes. (42) To accomplish"}
