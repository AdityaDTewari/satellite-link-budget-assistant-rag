While theorthogonally-po]arized channels arecompletely isolated intheory, some degree ofinterference between them isinevitable, owing toless-than-theoretical performance of spacecraft andEarth station antennas, anddepolarizingeffects onthe propagation path. Themain sources ofthis depolarization atmillimeter wave frequencies arehydrometeor absorption andscattering inthetroposphere. 4.1.1 Definition ofTerms Frequency reuse satellitecommunications systems utilize either orthogonallinearorcircular polarization states. Theorthogona]linear polarization (LP) states, arenormally referred toasvertical andhorizontal, butexcept forEarth stations atthesatellite'slongitude, thepolarization directions arerotated somewhat from thelocal vertical andhorizontal references. Theorthogonal circular states areleft-hand andright-hand circular polarizat4on (LHCP, RHCP), differing inthesense ofrotation ofthe electric field vector. The\"handedness\"isdefined asfollows: awave isRHCP ifthesense ofrotation ofthefield corresponds tothenatural curl ofthe Prece ngpageblank I03 ................ °. fingers oftheright hand when theright thumb ispointed along the propagation direction. Likewise forLHCP. Thus aRHCP wave coming outofthe paper would have anelectric field rotating counterclockwise. Ameasure ofthedegreeofinterference between thetwo orthogonally-polarized channels isthecrosspolarization discrimination (denoted XPD), defined asfollows: LetEijbethemagnitude oftheelectric field atthereceiver that istransmitted inpolarization state iandreceived intheorthogonal polarization state j(i,j=1,2).
