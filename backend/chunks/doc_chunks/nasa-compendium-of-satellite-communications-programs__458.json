Dat~a Book The SHF band had four modes of operation, although all ground terminals could not use all modes. The modes were frequeficy modulation for voice or data:' TATS, DPSK, and broadcast alert. Table 14-6 presents the signal-processing techniques utilized in each mode. 14.3 SPACECRAFT Characteristics of the TACSAT 1 communications subsystem ate described in Table 14-7. A block diagram of the communications repeater is shown in Figure 14-3. There are eight ground commandable modes corresponding to the four filter bandwidths at each frequency band. Two of the modes represent cross-coupled operation between the UHF and SHF repeaters. TACSAT 1 was the first U. S. spacecraft stabilized with gyrostat technology.(4) This means that the satellite does not have to be spun about its maximum moment of in­ ertia design constraints. The spacecraft consisted of a large spinning cylinder within which was mounted a cone-shaped structure. A bearing assembly attached to the cone structure supported, on its housing, a despun platform containing antennas and communications and telemetry equipment. The spinning section contained solar cells, batteries, auxiliary telemetry, tracking, and command equipment, despin control electronics, the hydrogen peroxide propulsion system, and the nitrogen spinup system. A pendulum liquid damper was used for nutation damping."}
