The NASA Worldwide Minitrack network collected tracking and telemetry data. Selected newly procured tracking, telemetry, and command (TT&C) terminals were also pro­ vided by NASA. One of the most important of these was located on the Kingsport. The great contribution of Project Syncom to satellite communications technology was to display the feasibility of placing satellites into synchronous equatorial orbits and maintaining precision stationkeeping and attitude control. The synchronous equatorial orbit significantly reduced the ground terminal tracking requirements and made it possible to establish an essentially worldwide communications system with as few as three or four satellites. The only earth areas without satellite visibility in such a system are the regions immediately around the North and South Poles. The high altitude of the synchronous orbit and the capability to precisely maintain the satellite's spin axis at a 900 attitude relative to the orbital plane made it possible to employ antennas providing pancake-shaped radiation patterns of significantly higher gain than the previous essentially omnidirectional satellite antennas. Finally, the communi­ cations experiments verified the link propagation parameters and provided the first indication that round'trip time delay and return echo due to two-wire user terminations are not insurmountable obstacles to"}
