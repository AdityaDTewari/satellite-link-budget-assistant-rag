In the absence of local data, an appropriate reference standard atmosphere given in Recommendation ITU-R P.835 should be used. (Note that where total atmospheric attenuation is calculated, the same -water vapour partial pressure is used for the attenuation attributable to oxygen and the attenuation attributable to water vapour.) The water vapour partial pressure, e, at any altitude may be obtained from the water vapour density,  and the temperature, T, at that altitude using the expression: 7.216Te= (4) Spectroscopic data for oxygen is given in Table 1, and spectroscopic data for water vapour is given in Table 2. The last entry in Table 2 is a pseudo -line centred at 1 780 GHz whose lower wing represents the combined contribution below 1 000 GHz of water vapour resonances not included in the line -by-line prediction method (i.e. the wet continuum). The pseudo -line's para meters are adjusted to account for the difference between the measured absorption in the atmospheric windows and the calculated local -line absorption.
