SITE will transmit two audio channels simultaneously with the video. The two FM audio signals will use separate subcarriers at 5.5 MHz and 6.0 MHz. The video (625 lines CCIR system B) and audiosubearriers are summed at baseband, and the composite baseband signal frequency modulates the uplink C-band carrier with a peak-to-peak deviation of about 18 MHz. The ATS-6 spacecraft will receive the signal on the earth-coverage horn and will retransmit at 860 MHz without processing the signal, using the 9.1-meter (30-ft) reflector. At the same time, it will retrans­ mit to monitoring stations having 12-meter (40-fit) dishes on the C-band, using the earth-coverage horn. 13-107 -The entire experiment will be evaluated by India in accordance with a mutually agreeable plan during the broadcasting period and after it is completed its technical and social impact will be assessed. This information will then be available to aid other developing countries desiring to implement such a program. The organization of the project is as follows: 1.
