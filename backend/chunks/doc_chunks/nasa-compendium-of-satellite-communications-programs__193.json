LES-6 Earth Visibility as a Function of Antenna Elevation Angle Operating frequencies for.the threeUHF Lincoln Experimentat',atelltes -14 )(2 1)( 3) are shown in Table 9-12 . The,,choice of the UHF frequency band.for these studies was governed principally by the antenna problemand the, spectrum alloca­ tions that were available for military use. In the very constrained physical environ­ ment of a small mobile terminal, and in particular in the environment of.an ­ aircraft, it is highly desirable to use simple antennas which do not require accurate pointing. Given this requirement, a relatively low frequency is-attractive since the receiving cross sectionof a dipole antenna is proportional to the square oithe .wavelength(33) The limitations on the lower end of the spectrum are governed by noise background and spectrum availability Table 9-12.
