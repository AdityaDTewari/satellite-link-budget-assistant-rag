Major Subsystems of a NASA ATS Terminal. 13.2.5 Experiments Experiments conducted as part of the spin stabilized ATS program are listed in Table 13-13. (3)(4)(5) The table shows the seven major experiment categories, listed in Table 13-1, into which the individual experiments can be grouped. In the case of the satellite VHF transponder experiments, some overlap between categories existed. These transponders supported selected meteorology and navigation experi­ menfs in addition to the communications and propagation experiments. Specifically, in the WEFAX experiment, the satellite VH'F transponder relayed Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) weather data (including ATS SSCC photographs) in facsimile format from Suitland, Maryland to Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) stations in the U. S., Japan, and Australia. (12) As part of OPLE, the spacecraft VHF repeater relayed interrogations and responses between the OPLE Control Center (OCC) and small remote platforms which were sometimes in motion. Responses included data from local sensors and OMEGA navigation system VLF tones received at the remote platforms and up converted to VHF. (13) Various other navigation and postion location experiments employed the spacecraft VHF transponder for ranging measurements. The meteorological experiments, defined in Table 13-13, produced a vast number of high quality pictures from the spacecraft camera systems and demonstrated the feasibility of weather facsimile through the satellite's VHF repeater. The space­ craft stabilization experiments have displayed that nutation sensing and damping, for nutation angles between 0. 0010 and 5. 00, can be satisfactorily accomplished and that hydrazine thrusters are feasible; the resistojet stabilization experiment was not as successful. The entire ammonia fuel load was depleted on ATS-1 (probably by a leak at a"}
