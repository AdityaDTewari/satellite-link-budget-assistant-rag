The station consists basically of the following: 1. A 3.7-meter (12-foot) diameter focal fed antenna so constructed as, to be readily. erected by two technicians in a few hours. Provision is made to permit the antenna to be mounted on a variety of sites by the inclusion of various ground anchoring arrangements. The antenna reflector is as- ­ sembled from four horizontally sliced segments for ease of storage in a Twin-Otter. The total weight of the complete antenna is less than 272 kg (600 Ib). 2. An equipment shelter of cube form of 2-meter (6-foot) sides is constructed of relatively light foam filled fiberglass panels some 1 meters x 2 meters (3 ft x 6 ft). The roof and floor are strengthened to take snow/ice and equipment/people loads respectively. It can be erected by two men in about half an hour by virtue of its light prefabricated sections .which, are locked in place by a wedge inserted by hand into fittings mounted on the panels. 3. Message communications equipment, identical to that which is used in the Thin Route stations, as described previously, except that it is packaged in shorter equipment racks to permit easy transportation and set up, and which is powered by a standard incoming 110V 60 Hz supply. 18-43 The whole package is kept within operating temperatures by provision of a.self­ regulating heater/blover fan arrangement. The total power requirement in a typical Arctic environment is 5 KVA including lights and a 1.'5 KW heater. 18.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS 18.6. 1 Television Services for the CBC The television services provided to the CBC accommodate the distribution of network-quality television to major centers across Canada for redistribution on ter­ restrial systems, and permit the extension of television to individual communities in the remqte regions of the country."}
