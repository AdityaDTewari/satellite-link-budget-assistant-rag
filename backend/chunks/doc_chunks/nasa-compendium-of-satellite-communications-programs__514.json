The antennas can be cross-strapped to permit any antenna to receive and transmit via any other. The various transponders and cross-straps have different band widths selected on the basis of expected needs. The satellites have tunnel diode inputs and TWT output amplifiers The first launch of two satellites from the initial procurement of six occurred on November 2, 1971. The Titan 1IIC was used as launching vehicle for lifting the two sat­ ellites into synchronous orbit. Both of the satellites in the initial launch have failed. This left four spacecraft of the original procurement to undergo extensive redesign before a second launch attempt. The redesign included balancing of the design platform and a major change in the power distribution. The redesign was completed and two more Phase H DSCS satellites were launched on December 13, 1973. 1 ) These satel­ lites have undergone extensive testing and were placed into operation in March 1974. Another dual-satellite launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. 17.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Phase II DSCS will have several distinct periods or stages, each providing different communications capabilities. In the first period, Stage la, Phase II operates in the FDMA and code division multiple access (CDMA) modes, and provides a point­ to-point operational capability after completing essential on-orbit satellite tests. In Stage la, the point-to-point terminal linking arrangement results in an oper­ ational system similar to that of Phase I. However, in this case, many links will be handled simultaneously by each satellite. During this initial stage of the Phase II DSCS, only the upgraded Phase I terminals will be included in the system. The traffic will range from one analog voice channel between AN/TSC-54 terminals to 12 analog voice channels between AN/MSC-46 terminals. A few selected links will"}
