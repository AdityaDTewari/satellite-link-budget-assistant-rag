Since continuous aperture antennas require mechanical steering to provide greater coverage, additional antennas could be placed on the spacecraft and switched in and out eliminating the need for steering. Although an array type antenna can be electronically scanned, the gain degrades as a function of the scan angle.(14) It may, therefore, be advantageous to provide more than one array and switch between them depending on the look angle required. As pointed out previously, the tradeoff between using more than one array and providing higher RF transmitter power depends on the point where minimum user spacecraft mass is achieved. Minimum mass configurations have been shown to occur at that point where the mass of the antenna is equal to the sum of the mass of the transmitter and its power supply.(15) 4.2.7 Feed Networks The antennas discussed here may be fed by balanced trans- mission lines or by coax and a balun (balance-to-unbalance trans- former), and in some cases by waveguide. Care must be taken to insure that the feed lines provide satisfactory isolation. Shielded balanced transmission lines offer the best guard against this since any currents induced on the shield or spacecraft excite equal currents on the two lines and are therefore RF grounded. When using coax lines the outer shield and the spacecraft structure itself must present zero resistance to the unwanted induced currents. Waveguide line becomes increasingly attractive"}
