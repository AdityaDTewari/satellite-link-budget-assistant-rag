The following isa mapping oftheACTS system operation into these reference events. [ i Access Request AnAccess Request occurs whenthe originating user signals the earth station that he/she wishes tocall another user. Theoriginating user's earth station then formats and transmits acircuit request message, which contains thedestination address, via itsinbound order wire totheMCS. Acircuit is established following theprocess outlined inSection 4.1.2. Theoccurrence of anaccess request signifies thestart oftheaccess time measurement. Nonoriginating User Commitment Theoriginating user receives a\"ring-back\" signal while thedestination user isbeing signaled. The Nonoriginating User Commitment occurs when the nonoriginating (destination) user answers the call. Incorrect access is eliminated asapossible access outcome when the desired destination user answers thecall. SystemBlocking Signal System Blocking Signals areissued only when theoriginating user's earth station cannot accommodate theca]l. Theoriginating user isnotnotified if thecall isblocked within theACTS LBRsystem (destination earth stations or i MCS). IftheMCScannot process thecall request, therequest isignored and theoriginating user will eventually abandon thecall. User Blocking Signal AUser Blocking Signal isissued when thedestinationuser iseither busy (the originating user receives a\"busy tone\") ordoes notanswer.Asdefined inANSI (1983),acall attempt blocked bythedestination user isexc]uded from thesystem performance measurements. i !1989010985-071 Start"}
