As noted in Recommendation ITU -R P.834, a radio wave between a station on the surface of the Earth and a space station is bent towards the Earth due to the effect of atmospheric refraction. As a result, the apparent elevation angle, which considers atmosph eric refraction, is greater than the free-space elevation angle, which only considers the line -of-sight between the two stations. If the free-space elevation angle of interest is greater than or equal to 5°, the difference between the apparent and free -space elevation angles is insignificant, and only the prediction method described in § 2.4.1 needs to be considered. An illustrative example of the three parts of the prediction method is shown in Fig. 2. Note that the prediction method in the transition region described in § 2.4.3 is tangent to the distribution described in § 2.4.1 at a free -space elevation angle of 5° and tangent to the distribution described in § 2.4.2 at a scintillation fading depth of 25 dB. 18 Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 FIGURE 2 Illustrative example of three parts of the scintillation prediction method At very small percentages of time, and similarly for large fade depths (greater than about 10 dB), the fading due to scintillation at very low elevation angles can be significant. The fading is also observed to have a character similar to multipath fading on terrestrial links. Similar to the distribution of fade depths on terrestrial links, the"}
