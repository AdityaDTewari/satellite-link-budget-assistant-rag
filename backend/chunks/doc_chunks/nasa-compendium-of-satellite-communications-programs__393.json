Also the C-band to S-band signal can be repeated on C-band. (41) Signals for the satellite instructional television experiment are received at C-band and simultaneously transmitted on UHF and C-band. The UHF transmission is for the primary experimental use while the C-band signal can be monitored at ground stations geographically remote from the area covered by the UHF beam. For the wideband signals used in the millimeter wave experiments, the C-band receiver is used with a demodulator which is essentially flat from 30 Hz to 5 MHz. Signals from the very high resolution radiometer are used to frequency modu­ late the C-band transmitter. The VCO used to generate the FM signal is extremely linear (±1%) in order to minimize distortion of the radiometer information. In order to assist ground stations in directing the high-gain antennas toward the ATS spacecraft, a CW C-band radio beacon signal is transmitted upon command in the earth coverage mode. A monopulse mode is implemented in the C-band frequency range for determin­ ing the attitude of the spacecraft in roll and pitch with an accuracy of about ±0.30. This signal can be fed directly to the attitude control system and to the telemetry system for transmission to ground stations. The communication subsystem also provides C-band transmission for signals derived from the RFI experiment. A two-channel TV transmit capability in the 13-70 2.5 to 2.69 GHz band will be supplied by the communications subsystem for the ETV experiment. (41) 13.4.3.1 Antennas- The antennas used with the communications system are located in two areas: (1) the prime focus feed, on the top surface of the EVM, which illuminates the 9­ meter (30-foot) parabolic reflector, and (2) the earth viewing horns on the bottom sur­ face of the EVM"}
