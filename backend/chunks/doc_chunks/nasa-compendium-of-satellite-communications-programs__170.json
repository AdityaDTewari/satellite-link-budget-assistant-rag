The principal satellite commuiicitions terminals participating in experiments with the X-Band LES satellites are-listed in Table 9-3(6) (7) The terminal at Camp Parks and one of the terminals at Millstone Hill were the facilities originally developed for Project West Ford. Lincoln Experimental Terminal-1 (LET-i) was a transportable ground terminal housed in two vehicles capable of being towed as trailers. One vehicle contained the antenna and RF equipments. The second vehicle contained the signal conditioning and processing equipment necessary for signal generation, modulation and up conversation to IF. The LET-i terminal was located adjacent to the Lincoln Laboratory's Facilities in Lexington. The other two LET terminals consisted of a LET-I type signal processing van utilized with existing antennas and RE equipment. LET-2 employed the 18-meter (60-foot) West Ford antenna and X-band RF equipment at Millstone Hill. LET-3 employed the 9.1-meter (30-foot) antenna and X-band RF equipment of the Armyts.transportable Mark 1A terminal. The LET-3/Mark -1A'combination was initially deployed to Camp Roberts, California for LES tests. I After a few mouths it Was moved to Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey for a limited-numher of LES exjferiments and 'subsequent modification for-tests with the IDCSP satellites. 9-5' Table 9-3.
