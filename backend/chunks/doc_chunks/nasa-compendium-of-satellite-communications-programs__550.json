Telesat Satellite,- General Configuration 18-16 1001?.Q during the prelaunch, launch to separation, transfer orbit, and the two annual 46-day eclipse periods when the earth is between the satellite and the sun. The main body of the satellite is 191 centimeters (75 inches) in diameter and 152 centimeters (60 inches) high and consists of a 76-centimeter (30-inch) diameter thin-walled cylinder housing the spacecraft's solid propellant apogee motor. The cyl­ inder supports the satellite's 185-centimeter (73-inch) electronics platform. The platform contains the spacecraft's communications repeater, telemetry com­ mand electronics, and batteries. At the center of the platform is a pedestal-type support and motor-bearing assembly. The communications antenna is despun at a rate equivalent to the 100 rpm spin rate of the satellite. The communications repeater receives signals sent from ground stations in the 5925- and 6425-MHz band and downconverts these to 3700 to 4200 MHz for retransmis­ sion to other earth stations. The attitude of the spacecraft spin axis is determined on the ground by processing the telemetered sun and earth sensor pulses.' The sun sensors are redundant, spinning, vee-beam sensors which determine the spin phase angle and sun line angle. The earth sensors are spinning infrared telescopes having a bolometer detector and a video am­ plifier. Two independent orbit and orientation hydrazine reaction control systems are carried aboard the satellite, each consisting of two diametrically opposed titanium tanks, interconnecting gas and liquid lines, and two thrusters mounted just inboard aft"}
