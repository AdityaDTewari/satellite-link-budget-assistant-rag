This topic isdiscussed inSection6.8. 6.1.4.2 TroposphericDelays. Highly accurate satellite range, range-rate and position-location systemswill needtoremove thepropagation group delay effects introduced bythetroposphere. Extremely high switching rate TDMA systems mayrequire these corrections inthefuture. Theeffects •arise primarilyduetotheoxygenandwater vapor inthelower troposphere. Typical total additional propagation delayerrors have been measured tobeofthe orderof8nanoseconds (Hopfield-1971). 199 Estimation techniques, basedonthemeasurement ofthesurface pressure, temperature andrelative humidity have been developed (Hopfield-1971, Bean andDutton-1966, Segal andBarrington-1977) which can readily reduce this error toless than Inanosecond.Inaddition, algorithms forrange (Marini-1972a) andrange-rate (Marini-1972b) have been preparedto reduce tropospheric contributions tosatellite tracking errors. Since this topic isquite specialized andgenerallyresults inan additional one-way delay ofless than 10nanoseconds itisnotaddressed further inthis report.

Above 20GHzgaseous absorption canhave asignificant effect ona communication systemdesign depending onthespecific frequency ofoperation. Because ofthelarge frequency dependence ofthegaseous absorption, an earth-space communication system designer.should avoid thehigh absorption frequency bands. Alternatively, designersofsecureshort-haul terrestrial systems canutilize these high attenuation frequency bands toprovide system• isolation. 6.2.1 Sources ofAttenuation Inthefrequency range from 10to100GHzthewater vapor absorption band centered at22'235 GHzandtheoxygen absorption lines extending from 53.5 to65.2GHzaretheonlysignificant contributors togaseous attenuation. Thenext higher frequency absorption bands occurat118.8 GHz duetooxygen and183GHzduetowater vapor. Theabsorption lines are frequency broadened bycollisions atnormalatmospheric pressures(low elevations) andsharpened athigh altitudes.
