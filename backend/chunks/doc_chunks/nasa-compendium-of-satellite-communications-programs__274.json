Cumulative Outage Performance for Early Bird 10-55 1967 for operations with its successors. Live television between Hawaii and the U. S. main­ land was inaugurated via F-1 on November 18, 1967. INTELSAT H satellites (F-2 and F-4) were employed for service in the Pacific area. During the time when the F-4 satellite was undergoing final positioning maneu­ vers, its longitude was allowed to approach closely that of F-2 for the purpose of making intersystem interference measurements. At Paumalu, the 26-meter (85-foot) antenna was operating with F-2 while the 13-meter (42-foot) antenna was available for experimental work with F-4. Experiments and measurements of interference were made as the satellites approached to within 0.50 of each other. It was concluded from these interference measurements that the INTEISAT II system can be safely operated with a minimum of 1.60 of longitude separation between satellites. Both of these satellites and F-3, which supplemented Early Bird in the Atlantic area by pro­ viding wide area service, have operated satisfactorily providing commercial com­ munications service. Multiple-access service was successfully initiated with the INTELSAT II satellite (F-2) on"}
