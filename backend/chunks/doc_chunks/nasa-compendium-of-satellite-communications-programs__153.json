The basic configuration for the communications subsystem on the Syncom satellites is displayed in Figure 8-2. (4) Each receive channel consists of a mixer, a local oscillator, an IF amplifier, a limiter amplifier, and a mixer connected through a hybrid to the redundant TWTs. TOTLEMETRY A COFUNICATION SUBSYSTEM Figure 8-2. Synon -I, U, Ill: Communications Transponder Syncom II differed from Syncom I only in nitrogen tank mounting and internal operating pressure, the wiring harness, and the addition of a standby battery to pro­ vide 40 minutes of telemetry should the main power supply fail. These changes re­ sulted from the conclusion that a high-pressure nitrogen tank failure caused the loss of Syncom I. Based on Syncom II experience, several modifications were also made to Syncom III. N-on-P solar cells with 0.30 mm (12-mil) fuzed silica covers replaced the more radiation sensitive P-on-N solar cells with their 0.15 mm (6-mUl) glass covers. A redundant hydrogen peroxide (H202) system replaced the high pressure nitrogen (N2) system. The stand-by battery and apogee motor timer were deleted. Two temperature 8-7 Table 8-5.
