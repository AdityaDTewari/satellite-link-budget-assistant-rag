In the absence of local data at the required time per centage, the mean gaseous attenuation should be calculated and used in equations ( 65) and ( 66). The total attenuation, 𝐴𝑇(𝑝) (dB), for a fixed probability, is given by: 𝐴𝑇(𝑝)={𝐴𝐺(𝑝)+√(𝐴𝑅(𝑝)+𝐴𝐶(𝑝))2+𝐴𝑆2(𝑝) ,0.001% ≤ 𝑝≤ 5% (65) 𝐴𝐺(𝑝) + √𝐴𝐶2(𝑝) + 𝐴𝑆2(𝑝),5% < 𝑝 ≤ 50% (66) where: AC ( p) = AC (5%) (dB) for p < 5.0% (67) AG ( p) = AG (5%) (dB) for p < 5.0% (68) When the total attenuation prediction method was tested versus measured total attenuation statistics using either concurrent measured rain rate or the worldwide rain rate maps in Recommendation ITU-R P.837, the r.m.s. relative error averaged over the probability range from 0.001% to 5% was about 33%. Due to the dominance of different effects at different probabilities as well as the inconsistent availability of test data at different probability levels, some variation of r.m.s. error occurs across the distribution of probabilities. 2.6 Attenuation by sand and dust storms Very little is known about the effects of sand and dust storms on radio signals on slant -paths. Available data indicate that at frequencies below 30 GHz, high particle concentrations and/or high moisture contents are required to produce significant propaga tion effects. 3 Noise temperature As attenuation increases, so does emission noise. For earth stations with low -noise front -ends, this increase of noise temperature may have a greater impact on the resulting signal -to-noise ratio than the attenuation itself. 24 Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 The sky noise temperature at a ground station antenna may be estimated by: Tsky = Tmr (1 – 10–A/10) + 2.7 × 10–A/10 K (69) where: Tsky : sky noise temperature (K)"}
