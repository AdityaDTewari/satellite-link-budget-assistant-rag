Bicone Antenna 4-28 4.3.4 Bicone Antennas The Bicone antenna, by virtue of its omnidirectionality in the plane perpendicular to the spin axis of a spin-stabilized spacecraft, has been used on several Hughes-designed and launched spacecraft. These include the USAF Tactical Communications Satellite (TACSAT), (19) the INTELSAT IV, and the Canadian Domestic Satellite, ANIK. Of these, the TACSAT bicone operates at 2 GHz, whereas the commercial satellites operate at 4 GHz for telemetry. The two cones which make up the aperture, shown in Figure 4.9, are usually spun out of sheet aluminum. The circular guide in the center is machined from aluminum stock, the slots are then machined, and the cones are then spot-welded to the circular guide. The bicones are then housed in a fiberglass thermal shield and mounted on top of the spacecraft. A set of radiation patterns for the bicone antenna is shown in Figure 4.10. The characteristics and performance of the 2 GHz TACSAT antenna, which is representative of possible spin stabilized user satellite antennas, are given in Table 4.6.
