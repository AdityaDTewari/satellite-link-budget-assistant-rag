Either or both feeds can be energized on command; however the -frequency is different in each footprint. It can be seen by exainining the chart that the to foot­ prints which can be generated cannot cover all of the participating states. As a con­ sequence, a time sharing arrangement is planned in which the Rocky.Mountain- region is divided into two zones, an Eastern zone and a Western zone; each zone can be approximately covered by the two footprints as shown. It is planned to repeat key (41)elements of the experiment in the Eastern and the Western zones. 13.4.4 Ground Terminals (4 1)Introduction 13.4.4.1 Three ATS ground stations provide the main support to ATS operations for com­ mand and control of the ATS-6 spacecraft, for collection of range and range-rate data for orbit determination, and for the performance of technological and scientific experiments. One station is located at Rosman, North Carolina and two are collocated at the Mojave site on Goldstone dry lake near Barstow, California. One is a fixed terminal like Rosman and the other is the transportable Hybrid Terminal. The Hy­ brid Terminal will consist of elements from the ATS Mobile Terminal and the Trans­ portable Ground Station (TGS) which was used in Australia during ATS 1-5 operations. It will initially be operated with ATS-6 while located at.Mojave -and then moved over­ seas several months after launch. The Mobile Terminal can be separated from the Hybrid Terminal to provide an RF link when it is desired to remotely locate experi­ menter's equipment. In either configuration the Hybrid or Mobile Terminals will contain UHF equipment to support the 860-MHz downlink for the SITE experiment. The Rosman data acquisition facility will be the primary ground station. The two secondary stations, Mojave-and the"}
