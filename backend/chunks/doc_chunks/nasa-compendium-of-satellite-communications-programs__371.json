These terminals were described in Table 13-2. Terminals participating in millimeter wave and L-Band experiments were defined in Table 13-20. The millimeter wave installation at NASA's Rosman, North Carolina facility and the L-band installation at Mojave, California are typical of the earth terminals employed for these two respective groups of experiments. Major characteristics of typical millimeter wave and L-Band terminals are described in Table 13-25. (32), (34) Terminal block diagrams are provided in Figures 13-12(31) and 13-13. (32) The millimeter wave terminal block diagram displays the interest that existed in finding meteorological measurement techniques which could be useful in predicting propagation losses at these frequencies. The L-Band terminal was configured such as to allow operation in the satellite L-to C-Band cross strapping mode. The linear polarization employed at the millimeter wave terminal and the circularly-polarized feeds of the L-Band terminal were compatible with. the spacecraft polarizations making link losses due to this source small. 13.3. 5 Experiments Experiments that were planned for ATS-2, 4, and 5 are summarized in Table 13-26. (28), (29), (30) The Table also indicates the. six major experiment categories, listed in Table 13-18, into which the individual experiments can be grouped. Some data was obtained on most of the experiments onboard ATS-2. The data, generally, was of limited value, however, since a launch vehicle failure left 13-46 Table 13-25.
