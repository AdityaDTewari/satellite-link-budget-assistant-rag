Hence, to calculate the received Wr=N0ratio, you simply divide the received isotropic power by kTor subtract 192:5dBW/Hz in the budget. You can also compute the link budget using the receiver gure of merit as de ned earlier. Ob- viously, using either technique you should get the same result. The link budget employing the receiver gure of merit is shown in Table 2. In equation form, the link margin is calculated as follows: M=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr TS\u0015 dB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B)\u0000\u0014C N0\u0015 req;dB = 69:6dBW\u0000202:7dB\u000013:5dB+ (\u00001:0dB) + 228:6dBW/K-Hz \u000010 log(2 MHz)\u000010:0dB = 8:0dB Prof. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems Link Budgets Page 4 Description Symbol Value Notes 1.
