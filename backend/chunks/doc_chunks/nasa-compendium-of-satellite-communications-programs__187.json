This was in contrast with the planned perpendicular orientation. 'Despite the'unplanned orientation, LES-3 operated as designed and, in accordance with its sole mission objective, provided the signals necessary to carry out UHF propagation measurements. Atmospheric drag, resulting from the low'perigee of' this'satellite's Iihly elliptical'orbit, even­ tually caused the orbit to decay but not before all desirea -testiiighad been success­ fully completed. 9-20 Table 9-11.

Atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and attitude and stationkeeping maneuvers are among causes of parameter changes. LES-5 along with its companion satellites, IDCSP 16 through18, DATS 1 and DODGE, constituted the payloads successfully launched by Titan rn-C Vehicle No. 14 into planned near-synchronous, near-equatorial orbits(21) (26) The three essentially identical ]DCSP satellites, DATS 1 and DODGE were all part of the Initial Defense Communication Satellite Program (see Section 12).: IDCSP 16-18 augmented two earlier successful launches of seven and eight IDCSP satellites respectively and completed the first U.
