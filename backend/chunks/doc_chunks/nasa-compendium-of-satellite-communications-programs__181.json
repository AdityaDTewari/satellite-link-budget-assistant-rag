Five solid state detectors were employed. A sixth detector was continually exposed to a source of known intensity and served as a calibration sensor such that the degradation of the five detectors due to the space radiation environment could be determined. Three of 9-15 the five detectors were shielded silicon cells while the other two were CdTe thin film cells. Results on the CdTe cells, as constructed, indicated they could not satisfactorily withstand a space environment(1S). Earth. albedo measurements were also made as an additional experiment on the earth environment(14)(15) Table 9-8.

The despun antenna experiment was carried on all three X-band satellites. On LES-1, the switched antenna functioned as expected during most of the first 10 orbital revolutions until conversion to the 60-rpm tumbling mode was completed (1 6 ) . On LES-2 operation was satisfactory and"}
