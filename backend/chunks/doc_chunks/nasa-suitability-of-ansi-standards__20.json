User-oriented system performance concerns for types Aand Bdigital satellite links canbegrouped into thethree ANSX3.102 performance categories ofspeed, accuracy, andreliability discussed inSection 2.These categories arequantified by5ofthe21ANSX3.102 system performance parameters: Bit Error Probability, Block Error Probability, Block Transfer Time, User Information Bit Transfer Rate, and Transfer Denial Probability (Table 4). These five parameters areselected entirely from theuser information transfer function category ofANSX3.102. This selection isreasonable because with dedicated point-to-point digital satellite links users have full time access; thus, Access and disengagement functions are r;ot encountered during normal operation. Also since there arenoswitching orstore-and-forward functions, data entering the system follows only one path; thus, there are no opportunities for user bits oruser data blocks tobeduplicated, lost, or misrouted. Therefore, th_bit/block loss andmisdelivery probability andextra bit/block probability parameters arenotincluded. Thefour ancillary parameters (attributable touser actions) arealso not included. Bytreating thesatellite links assubsystems, there arenodirect connections orinteractions with theusers."}
