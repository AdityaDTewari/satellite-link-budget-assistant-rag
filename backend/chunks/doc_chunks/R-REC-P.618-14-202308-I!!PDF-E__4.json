The effects include: j) Faraday rotation: a linearly polarized wave propagating through the ionosphere undergoes a progressive rotation of the plane of polarization; k) dispersion, which results in a differential time delay across the bandwidth of the transmitted signal; l) excess time delay; m) ionospheric scintillation: inhomogeneities of electron density in the ionosphere cause refractive focusing or defocusing of radio waves and lead to amplitude fluctuations termed scintillations. Ionospheric scintillation is maximum near the geomagnetic e quator and smallest in the mid -latitude regions. The auroral zones are also regions of large scintillation. Strong scintillation is Rayleigh distributed in amplitude; weaker scintillation is nearly log-normal. These fluctuations decrease with increasing fr equency and depend upon path geometry, location, season, solar activity and local time. Table 2 tabulates fade depth data for VHF and UHF in mid -latitudes, based on data in Recommendation ITU-R P.531. Accompanying the amplitude fluctuation is also a phase fluctuation. The spectral density of the phase fluctuation is proportional to 1/ f 3, where f is the Fourier frequency of the fluctuation. This spectral characteristic is similar to that arising from flicker of frequency in oscillators and can cause significant degradation to the performance of receiver hardware. 4 Rec.
