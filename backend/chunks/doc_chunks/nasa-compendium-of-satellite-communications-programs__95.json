The terminals included a record and playback speed changing capability in their data storage system such that stored teletype messages could be transferred to and from the satellite at a 55-kbps rate.

This loss was avoided-on the downlink without resorting to a polarization tracking system by employing crossed dipoles and dual receivers at each downlink frequency to give polarization diversity reception. 4.5 EXPERIMENTS Experiments conducted on Project Courier can be grouped into the three major categories listed and defined in Table 4-7. (2) Each of these groups of tests contributed to accomplishing the program objectives. Table 4-7. Summary of Program Experiments Type Description 1. Communications Evaluate link parameters and communications Performance traffic handling capabilities of a delayed repeater satellite. ­ 2. Satellite Performance Determine capability and reliability of-various subsystems of complex signal processing repeater. 3. Jamming Resistance Measure satellite and communications per­ formance under interference conditions on VHF or UHF uplinks to satellite. The spacecraft performance tests monitored items such as satellite tape recorder operation, temperature, spin axis attitude, spin rate, solar power supply, and command system performance. (2) During the short operational lifetime of Courier Ib the satellite performance was (in general) good and in agreement with expectations. Spin rate was observed to decay at the rate of about 1 rpm per month. Performance exceptions involved the tape"}
