The orbits selected are highly elliptical, with 12-hour periods and apogees occurring over the northern hemisphere. These satellites provided the Soviet Union with a long-haul, cross-continent, Moscow-to-Vladivostok communications trunk. Major spacecraft technological innovations included flywheel stabilization, fully sun­ oriented solar panels, and antennas that tracked the earth independent of the main body of the satellite. The X-Band LES Satellites of this period investigated despun satellite antennas, automatic on-board spacecraft attitude control, fully solid state transponders opera­ ting at X-Band, and ground terminal digital equipment providing random multiple access. Antenna despinning was of interest as a means of obtaining high gain earth coverage pencil beams on spin-stabilized spacecraft. The X-Band LES satellites pro­ vided an initial indication of the feasibility of despinning by switching between elements of a multi-element array encircling the spacecraft spin axis. However, since these satellites were not at synchronous altitudes, the full gain potential of the technique was not demonstrated. Autonomous on-board attitude control to reduce ground control requirements was initially demonstrated on a satellite stabilized relative to the suit 1-16 Accurate on-board control of earth-oriented satellites remained to be proven. Solid­ state X-Band transponders were shown to befeasible, but their low efficiencids and power outputs made them relatively unAttf &activ as compared to the TWT output amplifiers being employed on operational sysems. Frequency hopping of the center frequency of an MFSK channel was demonstrated tb be i satisfactory approach to ran­ dom multiple access among users liahdling1°digital traffic. Frequency hopping was first considered on Project West Ford and wasof-interest as a means'to combat jamming in military systems, resist radio frequencj interference, and allow common occupancy of the same frequency/time spectrum b users having low duty cycle random require­ ments for service.
