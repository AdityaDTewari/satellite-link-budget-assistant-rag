DISCS Phase II Transponder Block Diagram The uplink frequency transmitted by a Phase II earth terminal determines which of the four modes will be used. (This assumes that an earth terminal planning to use either the NB-NB or NB-EC channels is within the geographical area covered by one of the NB antenna patterns.) The received signal is amplified and retransmitted in the 7250- to 7750-MHz band. A simplified frequency diagram presented in Paragraph 17.2.1 relates the various channel nodes, together with their related frequency translations and satellite antennas. Both the EC-EC and NB-EC channels share the output power of a 20-watt TWT amplifier, using the EC antenna. Likewise, the NB-NB and EC-NB channels are combined and transmitted via a second 20-watt TWT, using either one or both of the narrow coverage antennas. The bandwidth of each channel is presented in Paragraph 17.2.1 and represents 410 MHz of usable bandwidth. The satellite EIRP is 28 dBW for the EC mode and 43 dBW for an NB antenna (or 40 dBW each if two are used). This allows a marked increase in capacity and flexibility compared with the 7 dBW of the Phase I satellite. The Phase II synchronous satellites will be maintained with ±3 of their"}
