During 17 February to 2 June 1973, the U.K. and U.S. shared the satellite capacity of the U.S. DSCS Phase II Atlantic satel­ lite. Subsequent to the failure of the Atlantic satellite on 2 June, the U.K. reverted to scheduling the use of the U.S. DSCS Phase I satellites. The first attempt at launching a SKYNET II satellite, in January 1974, resulted in a mission failure when the second stage of the Delta rocket misfired preventing achievement of a proper orbit. A second launch is tentatively scheduled for late 1974. A SKYNET III program is planned as a follow-on replacement for SKYNET II. 15-25 CITED REFERENCES (1) F. C.
