This compares to a Pr/No of 52 dB required to obtain comparable quality on a single FM voice channel. 9-19 (LES) constituted the initial phases of this program.,. The program.was continued by the successful launching of TACSAT I in early 1969 (see Section 14). Specific objectives of the satellites and earth terminals included in the LES portion of the TACSATCOM 21) program are listed in Table 9-10 ( Table 9-10. UHF TiES Experiment Objectives. Number Description 1 Develop and demonstrate ,space. hardware operating in the miliary UHF frequency bands 2 Develop and demonstrate mobile tactical terminals operating at the military UHF frequencies 3 Investigate propagation characteristics of UHF satellite links 4 Determine the extent of RF interference to a UHF tactical satellite communications system 5 Study electronic switching in despun antennas 6 Evaluate high efficiency.,RF transmitters 7 Demonstrate automatic onboard satellite attitude control 8 Display automatic onboard satellite stationkeeping 9 Study the space radiation environment Three UHF Lincoln Experimental Satellites were launched as part of the TACSATCOM program as indicated in Table 9-11 (22) (23) (24) (25). LES-3 was launched along with LES-4,- Oscar 4, and OV2-3 as indicated in the \"General Description\" of the X-band LES (see Section 9.2.1). When the improper injection into a highly elliptical inclined orbit occurred, .-LES-3 was left spinning at-140 rpm •;..\" . . . .. .(14) \" with its spin axis inclined about 150 to the orbital plane 1 . This was in contrast with the planned perpendicular orientation.
