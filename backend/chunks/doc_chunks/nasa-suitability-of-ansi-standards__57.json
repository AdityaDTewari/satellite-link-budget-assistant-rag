Other losses inthe rflink are accounted for inLmscThese include waveguide, polarization, pointing losses, and rain fade margin. Ifthese losses are not specified, avalue of3to5dBfor C-band applications is typically assumed. Forhigher fre%uency bands such aska,these losses become more significant anddifficult topredict. Forexample, NASA allocates 17.8 dB forLms=, (8dBforrain loss), ontheHBRreference station down link during anticipated maximum rain fade conditions. I Much work hasbeen done inthedevelJpment ofstatistical rain attenuation models. Most efforts are based onthe probability ofpoint-rain-rates exceeding _certain percentage oftheyear foragiven rain climate region. A detailed application ofthese models can befound inPritchard and Sciulli (1986) andFlock (1988).
