In each group, the main RESA will have a terminal that re­ ceives and sends the material broadcast by satellite. The other two RESAs will have terminals that only receive broadcasts; they will be connected to the main RESA by land lines, so the questions and comments of teachers who- are taking the courses at the ancillary RESAs can be relayed to the other students and to the facilities in Kentucky. Figure 13-24 illustrates this 'experiment. The sites and types of terminals for the Appalachian Educational Satellite Project (4 2 ) are as follows: Location Type of Terminal Alabama Huntsville, RESA Intensive Guntersville Receive-only Rainsville Receive-only 13-92 ~ATS-3 .SFC f DEVR Figure 13-24.

(42) The Rocky Mountain project--labeled the Satellite Technology Demonstration (STD)--will focus on junior-high-school students as its primary audience. Starting in September 1974, about 4, 900 students in 56 rural communities throughout Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming will receive pro­ grams in career education directly by satellite. The programming will broadcast from Denver to the schools 35 minutes a day through the satellite. As many as 20,000 more students also will receive the programs through the region's public tele­ vision stations. STD terminals will be installed at 68 communities scattered through the eight participating States. Of these terminals, 56 will be at rural schools. The others will be located at the 12 Public"}
