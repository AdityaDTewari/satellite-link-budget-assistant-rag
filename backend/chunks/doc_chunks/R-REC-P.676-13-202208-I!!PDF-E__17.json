If the height of the space station is greater than 100 km above the surface of the Earth, then 𝑛𝑠 = 1. Since propagation through the atmosphere is reciprocal, the gaseous attenuation for a space -Earth path, where the apparent elevation angle at the space station is φ𝑠, is identical to the gaseous attenuation for the reciprocal Earth -space path, where the apparent elevation angle at the earth station is φ𝑒. As a result, the gaseous attenuation for a descending space -Earth path can be calculated as the gaseous attenuation for the corresponding ascending Earth -space path. If 𝑟𝑠 𝑛𝑠 𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑒cosφ𝑠>1, then the space -Earth path does not intercept the Earth. 2.2.4 Atmospheric bending The total atmospheric bending, 𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 , along the Earth -space path is: 𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 =∑ (β𝑖+1−αi)𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 −1 𝑖=1 (22a) =∑ [sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1 𝑛𝑖+1 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1)−sin−1(𝑛1 𝑟1 𝑛𝑖 𝑟𝑖+1sinβ1) ]𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 −1 𝑖=1 (22b) where a positive value of bending means the ray bends toward the Earth. Equation (9) of Recommendation ITU-R P.834 is an approximation to equations (22a) and (22b) for the mean annual global reference atmosphere. 2.2.5 Excess atmospheric path length Since the"}
