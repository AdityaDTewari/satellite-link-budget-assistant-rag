The radiator itself consisted of eight slots inclined at an angle of 55' and equally spaced about the outer conductor. Because the radial and tangential components of the field radiated by these slots were observed to be inphase, a radial wavegaide, constructed from two parallel metal discs, was employed to obtain the quadrature phasing required for circularly polarized radiation. The phase velocity of the axial component was unaffected by these discs. The phase 7-13 velocity of the tangential component, however, was a function of the spacing. Hence, by proper choice of spacing and diameter, a differential phase-shift of 900 between these two components was obtained, to produce circular polarization of the plane normal to the spin axis. The receiving portion of the antenna consisted of three parts: the transmission line, the inclined radiating slots, and the radial waveguide. Only a single port antenna was needed for reception as the two receivers were joined in parallel. The receiving antenna was mounted above the transmitting antenna and connected to the receiving port by a coaxial transmission line' residing interior to the coaxial line of the trans­ mitting antenna. The receiving radial waveguide acts similarly to that of the trans­ mitter in causing a 900 phase shift between the orthogonal, axial and tangential, electric-field components. The slots are oppositely inclined to those of the transmitter, resulting in opposite sense, circular polarization. 7-14 RELATED REFERENCES 1. B. N. Abramson and M. A.
