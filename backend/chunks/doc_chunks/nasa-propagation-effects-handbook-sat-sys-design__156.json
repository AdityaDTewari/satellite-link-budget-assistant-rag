Correlation of depolarization with rain rate hasnotbeen toosuccessful because ofthemany parameters required forthese calculations, However, experimentally and analytically (Nowland, etal-1977a) ithasbeen observed that rain-induced depolarization canberelated tototal attenuation bytheformula XPD =_-_lOglo(A) where XPDisthecross-polarization discrimination indBandAisthetotal attenuation indBduetorain (not including theclear airattenuation). and_areempirical constants. 6.7.2.1.1 CCIRApproximation.
