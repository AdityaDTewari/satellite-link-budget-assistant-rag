Access Denial Probability Access denial for the ACTS LBR system would occur when the system is operating close tocapacity andthus would notbeable tosupport anadditional circuit. Inthis case theBTPmaynotbeable toaccept anyadditional user traffic, orthe source ordestination earth stations might not beable to accommodate theextra bandwidth required foranadditional circuit. System capacity isreduced aud thus Access Denial Probability isincreased ifany I earth stations intheparticular dwell area require fade compensation. Also, ifthe destination earth station does not have any terrestrial circuits available, itwill block thecall (byissuing adisengagement request). Minor system/component failures would also cause Access Denial, e.g., the destination earth station is\"down\" ornot yet synchronized tothenet .rk. Additionally, biterrors ontheinbound order wire during acapacity request would cause theMCStoignore therequest, thus denying access. ! Access Denial due toexcessive delays ispassible. The threshold for T access denial, asshown inFigure i,isdefined asthree times themean system i Access Time. Therefore, under excessively heavy traffic conditions thecall ,_{ request processing time oftheMCS may exceed this threshold, thus denying 501989010985-060 T3 ? access. Also, iftheMCSdetermines that thecall cannot becompleted, the request isdiscarded. Measuring theAccess Denial Probability isuseful fordetermining thetrue system capacity andidentifying hardware andsoftware bottle necks. Therefore, Itisincluded inthesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters. AccessOutage Probability Access outages intheACTS LBRsystem canoccur foranumber ofreasons: theoriginating user's earth station is\"down;\" thecapacity requestmessages arerejected duetohigher channel error rate from aheavy, local rain storm; the MCS isnot operational; orthe satellite isscheduled for some other experiment andthus notavailable forLBRuse. Ideally, inafully operational system, worst-case values fortheAccess Outage Probability would beinthe range ofI0-Itoi0-_(Seitz and Grubb, 1983). Inanonrevenue generating system such asACTS, theAccess Outage Probability isexpected tobehigher because ofitsexperime_ital nature; however, theconsequences ofaccess outage arenot assevere asfor revenue generating networks. Therefore, Access Outage Probability isnot included in thesetofACTS LBRsystem performance parameters."}
