Then during thethird frame, thecontents oftheBBPoutput memory are transmitted inaii0 Mb/s burst inaTDM fashion during the appropriate down link spot dwell. Thus, ittakes three TDMA frames (3ms)for thesignal tobeprocessed through thesatellite. TheACTS system will operate inboth point-to-point andpr_nt-to-multipoint (broadcast) modes. Another ACTS techno _ demonstration isindependent rain fade compensation for the uplink and down link. This isdone with adaptive forward error correction (FEC) coding andburst rate reduction. Forexample, ifarain fade isdetected onthe uplink, theuplink signal isencoded with arate-I/2 cenvolutional code andtransmitted atareduced burst rate, thus increasing the link budget margin. When ::hesignal isdemodulated onboard thesatellite, it isdecoded andtheoriginal baseband bits arerecovered. Iffade compensation isrequired onthedown link, thesignal isencoded onboard thesatellite and transmitted atalower burst rate tothe destination earth station, again increasing thelink budget margin. Since itisunlikely that theoriginating terminal uplink and destination terminal down link will suffer rain fades simultaneously, thesignal isonly encoded onthelink that requires it;the clear link istransmitted uncoded atthenormal burst rate. With onboard signal regeneration, FECcoding, andburst rate reduction, it ispossible tosupport single-hop VSAT-to-VSAT communications. With type Aand Bcommunication satellite systems, ifaVSAT wishes tocommunicate with another VSAT, thetraffic must first berouted toalarge central hubterminal where it isregenerated and retransmitted tothedestination VSAT. This involves two satellite hops, thus increasing the propagation delay and making voice 401989010985-050 communications difficult (Glen etal., 1976). However, with ACTS, the satellite performs thefunction ofthecentral hub station, thus reducing the number ofh)ps andfacilitating acceptable voice communication. 4.1.2 ACTS LBRSystem Operation TheACTS LBRsystem uses portions oftheTDMA frame asorder wire channels tocarry network control information. Figure 7shows theflow ofthis control information through the various TDM_ bursts ofthe uplink and down link frames. Figures 8and9show theuplink anddown link TDMA frame structure in greater detail, illustrating dwell time slot andfade control allocations.
