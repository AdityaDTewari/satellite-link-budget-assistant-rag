The worst case must be calculated It is useful to implement a dual receiver with two orthogonal polarizations Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 45/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions More information More information AMSAT-IARU Link Budget For non comercial purposes Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation Universidade Centro de Innovaci\u0013 on de Vigo Aeroespacial de Galicia Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation Marcos Arias (Universidade de Vigo) Fernando Aguado (Universidade de Vigo and CINAE) marcos@com.uvigo.es Santiago de Chile.
