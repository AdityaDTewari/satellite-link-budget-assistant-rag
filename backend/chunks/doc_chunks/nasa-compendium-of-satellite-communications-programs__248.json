However, multiple point-to­ point links were established through the INTELSAT 11 transponders. The system configuration described, together with the second generation ground complex, pro­ duced a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity foreach INTELSAT II satellite. It was recognized, by the time the INTELSAT I satellites started to be put into service, that the satellite capacity could be increased and the system complexity re­ duced by switching to a point-to-multipoint mode of multiple-access operation. This was implemented by designing each terminal to transmit one preassigned multides­ tination FM carrier containing channels intended for all users to which it was linked. Baseband channels were preallocated to a particular user as part of a given network plan and were stripped off at each respective receiving site. The INTELSAT III satellite transponders were again designed for quasi-linear operation, and the same type of carrier control concept as utilized for the INTELSAT II system was employed. The described mode of system operation allowed the third generation earth terminals to realize a 1200-duplex voice-channel system capacity when operating through an INTELSAT Ill satellite. Alternately, the satellites could provide four television channels. The INTELSAT III approach to modulation, multiple access and system control was continued as the INTELSAT IV satellites were introduced to the system. However, it was supplemented, at an early date, by a full variable demand-access system called SPADE, which operates in a separate transponder of the INTELSAT IV satellite. The 10-25 SPADE system features PCM encoding of individual voice channels for quadriphase PSK modulation of a carrier. It includes the ability to deactivate carrier transmis­ sion to the satellite during periods of talker inactivity and a decentralized control concept allowing self-assignment of available satellite channels. The SPADE system has been assigned"}
