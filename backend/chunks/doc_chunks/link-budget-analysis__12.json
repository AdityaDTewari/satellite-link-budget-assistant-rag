C.BER < 10-6in data channels C/N = 12 dB (QPSK) at demod’s input. 4.S/N and BER depend on C/N and on the modulation technique.

A.To represent the minimum carrier performance before link failure. B.Is used as the basic measure of how strong the received signal is. C.It is the measure at the input to the receiver. D.Directly related to the amount of power transmitted from the uplink station. 2.Eb/N0is equal to the Signal -to-Noise ratio divided by the \"gross\" link spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz, where the bits in this context are transmitted data bits, inclusive of error correction information and other protocol overhead. 3.Eb/Noexpressed in linear form : Expressed in decibel form : 4.Eb/No= (S/N) + Noise Bandwidth –Information Rate, dB.
