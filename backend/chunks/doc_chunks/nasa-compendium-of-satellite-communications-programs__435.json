Laboratories A number of European countries and India have expressed interest in partici­ pating in this experiment during the spacecraft's second year of operation while ATS-6 is located over Africa at the equator. Each ground station wiil record and process its own propagation data to develop detailed statistics on signal attenuation and amplitude and phase effects caused by adverse weather. Data collected by the Rosman station will be transferred to Goddard via wide-band data line for processing and evaluation.

This experiment will gather-data on'satellite signal attenuation, caused by atmosplheric'hydro­ meteors (mostly rain), at ground stations located in' different climatological areas throughout the U.S. The data will be most useful in determinjng.param­ eters needed for future spacecraft pommunications systems operating at frequencies in the millimeter- , wave range. -.-. j -.
