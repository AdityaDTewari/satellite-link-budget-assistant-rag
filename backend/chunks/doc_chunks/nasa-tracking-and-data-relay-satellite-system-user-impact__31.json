However, the receive signal level can be increased by adjusting the polarization of the transmitting antenna to the receive antenna or vice versa. 4.2.4 Low Gain Semi-Omnidirectional Antennas Antennas on the order of a half wavelength are low gain (2-4 dB) and radiate nearly uniformly over large sectors. They have the advantages of being lightweight, can be easily stowed and deployed, and usually require no gimballing. They have the disadvantages of large interaction with the spacecraft and unwanted gain in the direction of the RFI. These latter effects can be minimized by placing them above a ground plane or inside a cup. Doing so reduces the back radiation with a corresponding decrease in radiated coverage. The degree to which the back radiation can be reduced depends on the size of the ground plane. One-half wavelength diameter ground planes are effective when the desired radiation is perpendicular to the ground plane. However, when maximum radiation is desired parallel to the ground plane, multiple wavelength sizes are required to reduce the radiation past the edge of the ground plane. Chokes placed at the edge of a ground plane effectively make it appear larger. The judicious use of the spacecraft structure can also act as a ground plane to partially shield from RFI sources. Needless to say, directivity improvement by judicious use of ground plane characteristics can best be implemented at the higher frequencies. Here the wavelengths are relatively small and consequently insignificant structural difficulties arise. In Table 4.1, these antennas have been classified according to back radiation, weight, interaction with the spacecraft, stowage and deployment requirements and polarization characteristics. 4-14 4.2.5 Multiple Wavelength Antennas Multiple wavelength antennas can consist"}
