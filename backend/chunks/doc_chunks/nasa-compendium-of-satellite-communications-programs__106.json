Block Diagram of Communications Receiver PAGE ISST ORIGINAO POOR QUALIW POF the dipole distribution assumed an approximately toroidal configuration with a circum­ ference of 63, 000 km and cross-seetfon that varied ilorig the orbit, with a mean width of about 15 km and a mean depth (in the orbital plane) of about 30 kin In this condition each dipole was separated from its 'nearest neighbor by an average distance of about 400 m. This tenuous distribution of'orbital dipoles is known as the Project West Ford Dipole Belt. The above description of the dipole belt suggests that it may be considered as a large number of approximately coorbital passive satellite reflectors. Each passive reflector spacecraft takes the form of a short-circuited dipole half-wave 'resonant at a frequency of 8000 MHz The half-wave dipole was selected as the elemental reflect­ br because it achieves a large gain.in scattering cross-section per unit mass (due to resonance effects). In addition, the scattering from a large number of randomly oriented dipoles is essentially nondirectional.. Other passive reflectors which also achieve large gain per unit mass are available (e. g., a flat circular plate), but.most are extremely directional, a severe limitation for use in a sytem of worldwide.coverage. As a consequence of the concern that the dipole belt might result in interference to other scientific endeavdrs, limiting the lifetime of the belt became an 'important goal of the West Ford program. As a result of extensive studies on the orbital properties of the dipole belt, it was determined that the major influence on the perigee height would be solar radiation pressure."}
