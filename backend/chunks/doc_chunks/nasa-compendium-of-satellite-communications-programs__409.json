In Alaska, people who live in villages that can be reached only by airplane, and then only when the weather is good, will have a chance to learn about other people and cultures in their State. The education projects will use the ATS-6t s video and audio channels and the audio channels of ATS-1 and ATS-3. For Appalachia, the main broadcast point is NASA's ATS ground station at Rosman, North Carolina. For the Rockies, the broad­ cast point is Denver, Colorado. For Alaska, it is Fairbanks and Juneau. 13-91 13.4.5.2 The Appalachian Educational Satellite nroject (4 2 ) NIE.'s project in Appalachia has been developed by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a Federal-State agency created by the Appalachian Regional Develop­ ment Act of 1965 to coordinate Federal, State, and local governments' attempts to improve the total economic development (roads, health service, education) of Appalachia. In 1971, the Commission surveyed 32, 000 public-school teachers in Appalachia and learned that in-service training, particularly in the teaching of read­ ing and career education, was needed. The Commission, with selected Regional Education Service Agencies (RESAs), and the University of Kentucky are participating in the satellite project. This summer, the University of Kentucky will offer to elementary-school teachers, via satellite, two graduate-level three-credit courses through the 15 se­ lected RESAs. One course will be in career education; the other, the teaching of elementary reading. The system, will work-as follows: the 15 RESAs have been divided into five groups of three each. In each group, the main RESA will have a terminal that re­ ceives and sends the material broadcast by satellite. The other two RESAs will have terminals that only receive broadcasts; they will be connected to the main RESA by land"}
