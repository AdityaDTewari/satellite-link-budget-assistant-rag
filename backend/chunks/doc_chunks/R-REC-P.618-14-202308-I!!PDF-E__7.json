Each of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of frequency, geographic location and elevation angle. As a rule, at elevation angles above 10°, only gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud attenuation and possibly scintillation will be s ignificant, depending on propagation conditions. For non-GSO systems, the variation in elevation angle should be included in the calculations, as described in § 8.

ITU-R P.618 -14 (In certain climatic zones, snow and ice accumulations on the surfaces of antenna reflectors and feeds can produce prolonged periods with severe attenuation, which might dominate even the annual cumulative distribution of attenuation.) 2.1 Attenuation due to atmospheric gases Attenuation by atmospheric gases which is entirely caused by absorption depends mainly on frequency, elevation angle, altitude above sea level and water vapour density (absolute humidity). At frequencies below 10 GHz, it may normally be neglected. Its impo rtance increases with frequency above 10 GHz, especially for low elevation angles. Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU -R P.676 gives a complete method for calculating gaseous attenuation, while Annex 2 of the same Recommendation gives an approximate method for f requencies up to 350 GHz. At a given frequency the oxygen contribution to atmospheric absorption is relatively constant. However, both water vapour density and its vertical profile are quite variable. Typically, the maximum gaseous attenuation occurs during the season of maximum ra infall (see Recommendation ITU-R P.836). 2.2 Attenuation by precipitation and clouds 2.2.1 Prediction of attenuation statistics for an average year The general method to predict attenuation due to precipitation and"}
