Figure 3.4a is for a user orbital inclination of 330 00and Figure 3.4b is for i = 99 . As can be seen from the first curve a minimum of zero communication time exists for beamwidths of 650 or less. This means that for this antenna size there will be some revol- utions of the user orbit for which no communication is possible with the TDRSs. A similar condition exists for user orbits inclined at 990 for 300 ! e 1000 (Figure '3.4b). Figure 3.4 also shows that the maximum visibility time for i = 990 is consistently less than that for i = 330 when compared at the same beamwidth. This is to be expected since in the latter orientation the TDRS is never as far out of the user orbit plane as for the polar type orbits, and it is this out-of-plane distance that determines visibility time. Figure 3.5 presents an example of the geographic extent of the visibility regions for each TDRS when viewing a low altitude 330 inclined user orbit. For illustrative purposes, the TDRS's are assumed to be stationed at 190 W and 1350 W longitude. A user antenna beamwidth of 900 is assumed for the case of no antenna gimballing. Communications with a particular TDRS is possible only when the user subsatellite point falls in the TDRS visibility region. Jointly, the two regions depicted in Figure 3.5 will allow the user spacecraft to communicate with one TDRS or the other from 25% to 42% of the time (Figure 3.4a). Similar curves could be generated for the other cases. 3-9 RAND MNALLYWORLDRANDMCNLLYAMERICAS CENTER21) 9* 1 to* EAST 150' LO GIIUDE 180* 1 0- 1 WE ST 90* LONG17UDE 600O AS 30 LONGITUDE 60, 0 -Figure 3.5.
