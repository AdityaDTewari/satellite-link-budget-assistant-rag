Major ydifferences were a greater empliasis on digital traffic handling capabilities and an investigation of the feasibility of time division multiple access employing frequency translation repeaters.

(18) The-feasibility of operational systems was demonstrated in all cases. Major objectives of experiments performed using the VHF repeaters of the two satellites were defined in Paragraph 13. 2. 1. . However,. prio .to conducting the indicated investigations-, a series of ground-to-satellite-to-ground tests were conducted employing the VHF facilities of the NASA ATS earth terminals to provide S , .(19)baseline data. These tests and their primary results are described in Table 13-17. Aircraft to ground communications throughthe satellite has been successfully demonstrated on a number of occasions by commercial air flights- over both the Atlantic and Pacific. (5)(20) A number of airlines in the United State§ plus such foreign carriers as Qantas, Japan Airlines, and BOAC have participated in these tests. Briefly, the aircraft terminals have consisted of a frequency modulation transceiver capable of radiating up to 500 W, data"}
