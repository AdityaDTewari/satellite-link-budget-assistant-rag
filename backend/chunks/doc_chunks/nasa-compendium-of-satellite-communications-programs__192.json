Additional locations receiving. special, installations of telemetry equipment included 9-24 Cape Kennedy, Florida and Guam Island.. The main command station was Lexington, Massachusetts'. Spacecraft launchings were provided by the U. S. Air Force. The UHF LES program resulted in numerous advancements in technology available to support the design of satellite communications systems. It significantly advanced the state of knowledge of UHF propagation and the UHF noise environment including RF interference. In particular, the studies characterized propagation and noise pertinent to systems involving small mobile aircraft, ship, vehibular and manpack terminals. Workable experimental tactical communications terminals, including antennas and modems, were developed and demonstrated. The feasibility of high efficiency UHF satellite transmitters operating directly from an unregulated solar array power supply was displayed accurate autonomous attitude control of spin-stabilized near-synchronous satellites was exhibited. The feasibility of autonomous stationkeeping and station changing was demdnstrated. These two automatic control concepts could ultimately greatly 'simplify the heed for g'round control operations and ground tracking requirements. -This may become important as the number of satellites in orbit increases and the separation between them decreases. In addition, an electronically switched despun antenna system successfully operating at UHF frequencies was displayed. 9.3.2 System Description Numerous linking arrangements were devised among the many terminals participating in tests. The tests included individual terminal loop back, two terminal hald duplex, full duplex, and multiple access tests. Many of these tests centered upon the Lexington terminal. The-orbit-of the LES-5 spacecraft supplied 5 days of visibility at Lexington out of the 11 required for its slight west-to-east drift to produce one revolution of movement relative to a given spot on the surface of the earth(2 3 ) . The earth visibility supplied by LES-6 in its initial stationary location is shown in Figure 9-4(3S). 9-25"}
