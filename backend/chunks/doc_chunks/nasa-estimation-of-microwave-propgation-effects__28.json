Caution should beexercised before attempting toapply afamilyof curves such asFigure 35oranempirical model extending theconcept to perhaps30GHzassuggested byKaul, etal.(1978). Thedatabase was limited toexperiments inrain climate region D(New Jersey andOhio). Themodel isbased solely onattenuation rather than rain rate statistics. Thediversity paths formingthemodel data base werenominallyofthe same configuration; e.g. NW-SHbaseline orientation, elevation angles of 35°,azimuth angles of220°,andlink frequenciesbelow 20GHz.There- fore,theuseofthemodel isnotrecommended forgeneral application and forpropagation paths departingsignificantly fromtheconditions and notatallforfrequenciesabove 30GHz. Toanalyze therequirements forsite diversityseparation inrain climate region D(P_30GHz)oneshould first proceedwithapath rain attenuation distribution analysis (Section 2.2).Once thesingle-path attenuation versuspercent ofyear exceeded curve isobtained, themini- mumsite (path) separations maybeestimated usingtheISGHzcurves of Figure 35.
