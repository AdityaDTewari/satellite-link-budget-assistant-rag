The carrier frequencies were at 136.020 and 136.170 MHz, and each carrier was amplitude-modulated with three sinusoidal subearriers bearing the telemetry information. The antenna, supplied with each transmitter, was a quarter­ wave monopole made of spring wire. Upon satellite inflation, the antenna erected to a position normal to the surface of the satellite. The effective radiated power of each transmitter was greater than 34 milliwatts under continuous operation. The beacons were designed to operate for 1 year, at which time a mercury cell cutoff circuit terminated radiations. 3.4 GROUND TERMINALS Characteristics of three of the terminals listed in Table 3-3 as participants in Project Echo. are provided in Table 3-7. (5)(10)(18)(19)(20) Holmdel and Goldstone were the two major experimenters involved in Echo I testing, while the Stump Neck terminal participated in Echo I tests and was a principal evaluator of communications via Echo II Major subsystems of the Holmdel and Stump Neck terminals are depicted in Figures 3-3(5) and 3-4(10 ) , respectively. The configuration of each of these three terminals reflects the considerable concern that existed over the feasibility of accurately acquiring and tracking the passive Echo spacecraft. None of the terminals relied on the satellite beacon for tracking. Beacon tracking was performed by the NASA Minitrack network, and the data contributed towards the generation of program track information by Goddard Space Flight Center. Radar techniques were employed by the communications terminals to give an active tracking capability. However, optical tracking was the preferrea method of tracking when the satellite, was visible (i. e., at night). Circular polarization was employed to eliminate the need for polarization tracking. The direction of rotation (i.e., left- or right-hand circular) was selected at each transnit and corresponding receive antenna to"}
