Often, it is the margin that is of most interest in the budget, since it tells you how much room is built into the link budget. If the minimum required CNRCNR reqis known, the margin is simply the di erence in dB between the actual CNR and the required CNR: M=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr TS\u0015 dB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B)\u0000\u0014C N\u0015 req;dB A nice example link budget for a satellite system is taken from page 229 of Sklar, B., \\Digital Communications: Fundamentals and Applications\", Prentice-Hall, 1998, and is shown in Table 1. It is an uplink budget (from the earth terminal to the satellite) at 8 GHz, covering a distance of 40,721 km. The bandwidth of the satellite signal is 2 MHz. Note that the losses Lappear multiple times in the table, alluding to the fact that all these terms must be summed to yield the total losses in the system. These losses total 13.5 dB and include: \u000fFade allowance (6) refers to extra margin added to compensate for fading introduced by atmospheric and/or rain attenuation. \u000fOther losses (7) could include polarization loss, and propagation-related losses not modelled by free-space loss calculations. \u000fEdge of coverage loss (10) refers to the losses seen user at the edge of the coverage pattern, where the gain of the antenna (pattern) is lower and the signal also has a larger range to cover. Choosing the edge of the coverage pattern makes the budget conservative by assuming a worse-cast scenario. \u000fImplementation loss (17) refers to implementation losses in the receiver (e.g. detector e\u000e- ciency) Prof. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems Link Budgets Page 3 Description Symbol Value Notes 1.
