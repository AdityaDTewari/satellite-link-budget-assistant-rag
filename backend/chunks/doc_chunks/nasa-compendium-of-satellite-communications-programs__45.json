Interest beganto develop in employing L-Band frequencies (i. e., a higher portion of the UHF band) for aircraft and maritime position location and communications in the private and commercial 1-20 sectors. These frequencies, are attractive. because of the wider .bandwidths and more accurate position location afforded.; .,Further,. millimeter wave, frequencies started to. be considered for commercial telecommunication services. The.wider bandwidths available and visions of overuse of the allocated C-Band spectrum were-the driving forces behind this interest. During this period, the operational Intelsat system con­ tinued, to evolve, the Molniya and IDCSP systems continasd to supply satisfactory operational service, the Skynet and NATO.military. systems initiated operational service, the exploration of tactical -military communications was continued by,the LES program and supplemented by.a Tacsat satellite, and the ATSprogram conducted initial evaluations of L-Band and millimeter wave. communications. In late 1968, Intelsat began to' establish a third generation satellite system. By early 1970, five successful launches had been bompleted, and a truly worldwide system providing service over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans had been completed. b These satellites took advantage of the technology- developed in the ATS program by employing mechanically despun antennas. The transponderswere again linear, single conversion repeaters and FM-FDMA was the main mode of operation. However, experimentation was conducted on a PCM-PSK-TDMA system designed for 12- to 120­ channel links and PCM-PSK-FDMA, SPADE, designedfor links ranging from fractional requirements to 12 and 24 channels. Both systems-were demonstrated to be feasible. The TDMA development extended and confirmed earlier TDMA demonstrations con­ ducted as part of the ATS program. Between late 1968 and early 1971; two new operational systems came into being. A Skynet satellite was placed into a g6ostationary orbit providingvisibility from"}
