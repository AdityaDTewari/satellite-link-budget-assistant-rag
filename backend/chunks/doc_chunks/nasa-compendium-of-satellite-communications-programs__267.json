Earth sta­ tion experience gained at Andover, Goonhilly Downs, Pleumeur Bodou, and Funico demonstrated that efficient reliable communications could be maintained and heralded the introduction of multistation operations. Another area of major experimental interest to INTELSAT has been modulation techniques for multiple access of a single satellite transponder. An important inherent 10-49 advantage of communications via satellite is that a large number of widely separated earth stations can communicate with each other simultaneously through the same satellite. Through multiple access, the potential exists to greatly increase system flexibility and to reduce the size and equipment complexity of the space subsystem. As a result, techniques for multiple access have received a great deal of attention for both military and commercial applications. At the time of Early Bird, frequency modulation and frequency-division multiple­ access (FDMA) were the common approaches to RF modulation and multiple access. Both were favored because of their compatibility with existing hardware. It was also desirable at that time, due to limitations on realizable satellite power and weight in orbit, to operate spacecraft repeaters as hard limiting transponders. This approach to repeater design provided maximum efficiency in converting primary dc power into radiated RF power. However, the nonlinear transfer function of hard limiting trans­ ponders results in intermodulation among the various independent carriers existing in an FDMA system and thereby limits the potential system capacity somewhat. A means of avoiding the nonlinear repeater problem is to operate with only one carrier through the satellite transponder at any one time. This can be accomplished by having the earth stations transmit their information in bursts rather than continu­ ously as in FDMA, and by synchronizing these bursts so that they"}
