The total weight of the radome is 2540 kilograms (5600 pounds) and its diameter is 18 meters (60 feet). 3. AN/TSC-54 The AN/TSC-54 is a transportable satellite communication earth terminal. It provides the capability for tracking a communication satellite and for transmitting 7900- to 8400-MHz and receiving 7250- to 7750-MHz signals. A six-man crew can erect or dismantle the terminal in 2 hours. Fig­ ure 12-10 is a photograph of the AN/TSC-54. 12-22 l- Figure 12-10. AN/TSC-54 Satellite Earth Terminal The primary elements of the terminal are a modified S-141/G equip­ ment shelter and the antenna assembly. To complete the terminal, a primary power source and suitable mobilizing equipment are supplied. The equipment is configured to be transported overland with attachment of suitable wheel assemblies. Detachable ground mobilizers (GOAT mobilizer -travels over all terrains) are supplied to tow the terminal over unimproved terrain. The equipment can also be airlifted by hell­ copter. The entire system weighs less than 7938 kilograms (17,500 pounds) without fuel; no single package weighs more than 2,722 kilograms (6000 pounds). Also, the maximum dimensions and overall weight are compatible with the loading capability of cargo air­ craft such as the C-13OE. The AN/TSC-54 terminal uses an array of four 3.0-meter (10-foot) diam­ eter parabolic dishes, each of which has a Dielguide feed for Cassegrain illumination, providing a 5.5-meter (18-foot) effective diameter. The antenna is supported and stabilized in the operational configuration by tripod outriggers. The Klystron power amplifier, exciter and power supplies are mounted in the antenna pedestal base. The parametric amplifier and frequency translators are located directly behind the antenna reflectors. The signal interfaces of the antenna mounted electronics are at 400 MHz.
