Pro­ tected traffic will continue to be provided using pseudonoise equipment. However, the CDMA modems employed will be of an advanced model specifically designed to meet the Phase II system requirements. A full complement of the modified Phase I and the newly procured terminals is expected to be available for use during this stage. 17-5 A SCHOOL MAHE ANTIGUA C 0 SCHOOORE ELMENDORF BERLINTAEGU, KOREA SHE AA \\ \\ LA K E IU RSE LADTH COTIGNCY FUTENILA, \" -T FT NOKNA\\VA N N DETRICKAK AUN A4- NALE NA1CKlO G AN AN MPlARNOM Dr 1\" I- 1AWA -CAMPaC / DYRAI - TAK LILAND CONT fINlENCY 9 / BE I ~~NORFOLK T C N E C CYPRUS 0 --- ASMARA CONTINGENCY GA PTERMINALS Type Quantity INTEROP AJALEINGUANTANAMODIGO AN/FSC-9 2 GARCIA Atlantic and West Pacific Satellites East Pacific and Indian Ocean SatellitesL AN/MSC-60 2 .. ..~Link to be discontinued upon the establishmentAN Ship/Shore Link 4N M C 4 of the Lakehurst/Mahe Link.

Typical DSCS Phase H, Stage ib, Link Configuration The introduction of the digital equipment into the DSCS during Stage 1c will be a beneficial experience which will be very useful when TDMA equipment appears. The arrival of TDMA equipment into the DSCS will signal the beginning of Stage 2 Phase II DSCS. With the TDMA complementing the other digital equipment, more effective use of the Phase II satellites and significantly greater system capability are expected to be achieved. All links will be established on a time base (rather than frequency) allowing each terminal to function as a multiple link or nodal terminal. A full complement of modified Phase I and newly procured terminals will be available"}
