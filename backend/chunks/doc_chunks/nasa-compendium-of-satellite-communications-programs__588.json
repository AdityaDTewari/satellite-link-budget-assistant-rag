The bus will be connected by a heat conductor to a base plate on the spacecraft. b. The MDC cooling shall be by direct radiation to its vacuum enclosure. 19-11 FIU REG OUTPU INN POWER PROCESSOR CATHODE ANCCE, AND COLLECTOR VOLTAGES ARE TO GROUND 9FERENCED Figure 19-3. Typical Traveling Wave Tube 'Elements and Power Processor Electrical Interfaces 19-12 The primary mode of operation for the CTS is to drive the 200 watt TWT with one of the two 20 watt TWTs. Under this scheme the CTS transponder receives a TV trans­ mission at 14 GHz from the Ottawa control station via antenna No. 1 and rebroadcasts through antenna No. 2 via the 200 watt TWT. Simultaneously a signal from a low cost remote transmitter is received via antenna No. 2 and rebroadcast to Ottawa from an­ tenna No. I via the other 20 watt TWT. The alternative mode of operation, and backup in the event the 200 watt TWT is inoperative, is to use the 20 watt TWT in place of the 200 watt TWT. In both modes the transponder has two uplink and two downlink pass bands, each 85 MHz bandwidth, as shown in Figure 19-4. The SHI beacon is the final portion of the SHF communications experiment package and it consists of a solid state transmitter feeding a single horn. The beacon operates at either 12 mW or 20Q mW and broadcasts a single unmodulated carrier at 11.7 GHz. 19.2.7 TT&C Subsystem The TT&C Subsystem utilizes S-band transponders compatible with the Space Tracking and Data Network (STDN) unified S-band system. Command signals will be in PCM/FSK/AM format at a frequency between 2025 and 2120 MHz. The telemetry system is PCM/FM/PM format at a frequency between 2200 and 2300 MHz. 19.3"}
