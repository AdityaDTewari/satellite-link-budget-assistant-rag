INTELSAT III F-7 was successfully placed into service over the Atlantic on May 8, 1970 to supple­ ment F-6. As of mid-1971 INTELSAT III F-3, F-4, F-6, and F-7 and the associated ground complex continue to perform essentially as expected. The first INTELSAT IV satellite (F-2) was successfully launched into orbit over the Atlantic Ocean on January 25, 1971. Communications tests began on February 7, and on March 26 earth station antennas in 14 countries, then operating with the INTELSAT III F-6 satellite, began a simultaneous mass pointover to assume opera­ tional service through the INTELSAT IV F-2 satellite. The second INTELSAT IV satellite (F-3) was launched into orbit, also over the Atlantic Ocean on December 19, 1971. It was positioned, tested and then placed into service on February 19, 1972, at 340.5 E longitude. Subsequently, it was moved to 335°E longitude where it continues in service, replacing F-2 which is now in reserve at 3400E longitude. INTELSAT IV F-4 was launched into orbit over the Pacific on January 22, 1972, and placed into service on February 19, 1972, at 1940E longitude, taking over service from INTELSAT InI F-4. INTELSAT IV F-5 was launched into orbit over the Indian Ocean on June 13, 1972, and placed into service on July 30, 1972, at 61. 4E longitude replacing INTELSAT III F-3 which is flow in service as 60 0 E longitude. INTELSAT IV F-7 was launched into orbit over the Atlantic Ocean and placed into service at 330 0 E longitude on November 21, 1973, supplementing INTELSAT IV F-3. The INTELSAT IVA satellite is expected to be ready for launch in 1975. It is a Hughes product, as is"}
