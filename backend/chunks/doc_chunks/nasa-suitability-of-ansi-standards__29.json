Other Block Loss mechanisms include hardware and software \"crashes\" where thesystem fails momentarily, losing alldata intransit. Block Loss Probability isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. Extra Block Probability Extra Block Probability istheprobability that aduplicate block ofuser information isdelivered tothe destination user. Insystems using an _Qprotocol, anACKthat islost orchanged toaNAKcauses theunacknowledged information blocks tobcretransmitted. Extra Block Probability isincluded in thesetofTDMA system performance parameters. User Information BitTransfer Rate TheUser Infor,aation BitTransfer Rate forTDMA systems isdefined asthe total number ofsuccessful bit transfers divided bythe time required to transfer them. Itisthe same asthe Rbparameter used tospecify the throughput oftypes AandBcommunication satellites. Because _heTDMA systems areconnection oriented,norate conversion occurs; thus, theinput andoutput data rates areequal asrepresented bycase iofFigure 2.Therefore, either theinput oroutput maybeexamined formeasuring thetransfer rate. TheUser Information BitTransfer Rate isincluded inthesetofTDMA system performance parameters. Transfer Denial Probability Transfer denial for TDMA systems isthe same as_or types Aand B communication satellite systems (see Section 3.1.2). Itoccurs when the transmission quality ofthe link hasdegraded toapoint where theBitError Probability orUser Information BitTr_sfer Rate isworse than thespecified threshold (see Section 2). Increased Peduetosunoutages andrain fades are again theprimary cause.Because theUser Information BitRate isrelatively constant,itwould not contribute totransfer denial. The limiting case of 1989010985-043 transfer denial probability iswhen thesystem iscompletely unavailable, i.e., I the system is\"down\" because ofanequipment failure. The Transfer Denial Probability issimilar totheOutage parameter used interrestrial microwave systems and can bethought ofastheinverseofsystemavailability. Therefore,itisincluded inthesetofTDMA system performanceparameters. 3.2.3 Disengagement Disengagement, like access, depends onthe specificnetwork design and user/system interfaces. Also, llke access, disengagement isapplicableonly to theDAMA systems generating BTPchanges inreal time. Disengagement Time Disengagement Time isthe elapsed time fromauser _ssuing acircuit disconnection request towhen that user can make another circuit request. Disengagement Time isoneofthesignificant parameters forquantifying DAMA system performance because itgives anindication ofhow soon auser may establish another circuit. ._ Disengagement Denial"}
