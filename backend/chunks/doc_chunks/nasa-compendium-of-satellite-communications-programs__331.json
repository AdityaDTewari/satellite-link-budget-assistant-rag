The satellite's experiments enjoyed results similar to those attained with ATS-1 and it also is presently being employed for additional experimentation. Table 13-2.

The primary earth terminals involved in the SHF communications experiments conducted with the spin stabilized Applications Technology Satellites are listed in Table 13-3. (5) (6) The three NASA terminals indicated also included crossed dipole arrays for VHF experiments and tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C). A myriad of additional terminals participated in portions of the VHF testing. These 13-4 included fixed and semi-fixed earth terrnifals, 'aircraft terminals, shipborne stations, ocean buoy data platforms, and various fixed and mobile land-basea data platforms providing information on earth resources. Terminal locations were widely scattered over portions of the world having visibility of ATS-1 and ATS-3. Entities, in addition to NASA. providing VHF terminals included the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration, Office.of Naval Research, Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC), Hughes Aircraft, various major commercial airlines, and a number of foreign countries. Satellite launchings were provided by NASA. Table 13-3. Participating Earth Terminals Antenna Diameter Date Location"}
