The missing and broken booms were the result of the whipping action produced by spacecraft tumbling. The equipment turnoffs were determined to be due to low battery voltage caused by poor spacecraft aspect angle relative to the sun. No significant problems resulted from the turnoffs. The inability to retract booms was theorized to be due to boom motion preventing a smooth entrance into the rollers of the retraction mechanism. 13-53 Type Experiment 1) Spacecraft Antenna Patterns 2) L Band Propagation Pon 3) Spacecraft Oscillator Frequency.Offset 4) Spacecraft Intermodula- tion Distortion (SSB/FM) 5) Spacecraft Transponder Compression (FM/FM) 6) Spacecraft SSB/FM Modu- lator Linearity A 7) Spacecraft Frequency Response 8) Doppler Due to Spacecraft Spin 9) Multiplex Channel S/N (SSB/FM) 10) Spin Modulation Com- pensation Test Table 13-28. L-Band Experiments Nature of Results Obtained Half-power beamwidth 240 for transmit and 280 for receive Diurnal variations due to ionosphere were less than ±0.3 dB based four 24 hour test sequences. Observed short term fading and scintillation effects were less than ±0.3 dB on both uplink and downlink Spacecraft VCO offset from nominal decreased from about -245 KHz at turn on to about -180 KHz 200 minutes later. Spacecraft master oscillator caused offset in earth station baseband signal of about 4 KHz at turn on and stabilized to about 500 Hz 15 hours later At normal power output levels intermodulation products are approxi­ mately 26 dB below either of two test tones The initial point where a 2 dB increase in input power causes only a 1 dB increase in satellite output occurs at an earth station transmit power of 39.6 dBm Response of the SSB/FM L-band modulator to a tone received at several RF levels was linear up to a"}
