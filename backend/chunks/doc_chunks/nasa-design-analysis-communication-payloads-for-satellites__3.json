Once the link budget is ﬁnalized, a rough sketch of the generic components needed for the payload is made to obtain an estimate of the power and mass to meet the requirements of the NASA mission. Figure 2shows a generic communication payload for a single fault relay communication system. The switches switchin redundant components if the primary one fails. The diplexers in Figure 2 allows the same antenna totransmit on one frequency band and receive on a diﬀerent one. The use of up and down converters allow acommunication relay to receive and transmit signals between two diﬀerent communication sources. 2o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Figure 2. Schematic of K u-S/K aBand Space-Based Relay Communication Payload After determining the general components needed, the more tedious part of the process begins as the components either need to be custom-made or bought from a commerical company. Space-qualiﬁed compo-nents can be limited in variety as they can be made for speciﬁc missions, while others can be more genericas waveguides and switches. Looking up those components online, calling the companies for more detailedspeciﬁcations, and browsing through physical catalogs takes time. Integrating all the information into oneplace would be more eﬃcient, and a database is perfect for this. However, once all of these components are picked, the important characteristics of each component are recorded usually into an Excel document to getan estimate of the mass, power, and cost requirements for the mission. These steps are used each time acommunication payload is designed, and going through them takes"}
