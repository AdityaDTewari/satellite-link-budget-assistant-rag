This isaneffect which must beconsidered when frequency scaling attenuation measurements overawide frequency range.•! Thefrequency dependenceofeffective pathlength showninFigure 3.7-I arises from thenonuniformity ofrain along thepropagation path in combination with thenonlinear dependence ofthespecific attenuation onrain rate. Using thedefinition inequation 3.7-i, therelation (Kheirallah, etal-lgSO) Le(f2)=Le(fl)b(f2)/b(fl)(3.7-5) 92 '• Jhasbeen derived. This relation hasbeen compared with some experimental data andappears toapply best tothelowfrequency (4to10GHz) dataforhigh rain rates (exceeding 25mm/h). Kheirallah, etal(1980) attributes this to therelatively significant effects ofcloud attenuation athigher frequencies andlowrain rates. 0Rewriting equation 3.7-5onehas [Le(fl)II/b(fl) ={Le(f2) II_b(f2) :Le' I Leisdefined asthenormalized effective pathlength andismuchless dependent onfrequency thanLe.Kheirallah, etal(1980) suggests thatfor smallpercentages oftimeforwhichrainattenuation dominates, datasets I should beexpressed intermsofLebefore dataatvarious frequencies andelevation angles arecombined.(3.7-6) 3.7.3E_fective PathLength Versus Measurement Period Experimentally determinedeffective pathlengthsforvarying measurement periods (such asannual andworst month) show ahigh variability. Forexample, inFigure3.7-2each curve wasdeveloped from equal probability attenuation -rain rate measurements fortheperiod indicated. Twotrends are apparent. First,themonthly curves show adecreasingpath length with increasing rain rate, andsecond,theannual curves showapath length which increases slightly with rain rate. Thefirst effect arises because thehigh rain rate events inAugust areprimarily convective stormswith intense localized rain rates. Thesecond effect isprobably accounted forbecause the winter rains inMaryland aremore uniform innature andthezero degree isotherm issignificantly lower inwinter. Forthis case Leapproaches L forcold weather lowrain rate events. However, this effect hasnotalways been observed(see below) andprobably indicates that regions with low rainfall during thecoldweather months will show arain rate dependence to Lesimilartothat fortheworst month. 93 A E -r k- zw _J -r o. ,,i ow u.
