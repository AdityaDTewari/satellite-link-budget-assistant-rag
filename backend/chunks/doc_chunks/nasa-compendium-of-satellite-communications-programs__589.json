Command signals will be in PCM/FSK/AM format at a frequency between 2025 and 2120 MHz. The telemetry system is PCM/FM/PM format at a frequency between 2200 and 2300 MHz. 19.3 GROUND STATIONS One of the prime objectives of the CTS program is to demonstrate the feasibility of using low cost ground stations in satellite communication systems. The motive be­ hind this objective is twofold; first, to illustrate that broadcasts to remote areas are economically practical, and secondly, to encourage the participation in the experimental program of independent experimenters with limited financial resources but worthwhile experiments. Since the CTS program envisioned for the United States requires that each individual experimenter acquire the necessary ground equipment for his experi­ ment, the availability of lov cost ground terminals influences the number of potential experimenters. In light of this, the ground stations are configured to use commer­ cially available components. Both the United States and Canadian experiment programs 19-13 -,io I .- _ 85 - __I FIELD . -110 85 ___I CENTRAL 10 I MHz I TO SATELLITE TO SATELLITE 14.010 14.000 14.095 14.205 TRANSMISSION TO SATELLITE (UP LINK) 14.290 14.300 GHz - 143 85 110 85 - 77 MHz 11.700 BEACON (2OW SATELLITE SATELLITE TO TO CENTRAL FIELD (20W) (200W) 11.843 11.928 12.038 TRANSMISSION FROM SATELLITE (DOWN LINK) 12.123 12.200 GHz Figure 19-4. SHF Frequency Plan currently intend to have the basic terminal equipped with a 2 m to 3 m (8 ft to 10 ft) dish and tunnel diode amplifier. Such a configuration provides the figure of merit necessary for TV reception from the CTS. The antenna system will include both a dish and control mechanism. To keep the cost as low"}
