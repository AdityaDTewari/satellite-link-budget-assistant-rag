Section 2.2.3 extends the method to a descending path between a location above the surface of the Earth or in space and a location on or near the surface of the Earth. Sections 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 provide m ethods to calculate the bending and excess atmospheric path length, respectively, on an Earth -space path. Rec. ITU-R P.676 -13 11 2.2.1 Non-negative apparent elevation angles The slant path gaseous attenuation on an ascending path between heights ℎ1 and ℎ2 (ℎ2>ℎ1≥0 km) is: 𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑠=∫γ(ℎ) sinφ(ℎ)𝑑ℎℎ2 ℎ1=∫γ(ℎ) √1−cos2φ(ℎ)𝑑ℎℎ2 ℎ1 (11) where: cosφ(ℎ)=(𝑅𝐸+ℎ1) 𝑛(ℎ1) (𝑅𝐸+ℎ) 𝑛(ℎ)cosφ1 (12) γ(ℎ) is the specific attenuation at height ℎ, 𝑅𝐸 is the average Earth radius (6 371 km), φ1 is the local apparent elevation angle at height ℎ1, and 𝑛(ℎ) is the refractive index at height ℎ. While equation (11) can be evaluated by numerical integration2, the slant path gaseous attenuation is well-approximated by dividing the atmosphere into exponentially increasing layers, determining the specific attenuation (dB/km) of each layer and the path length (km) through each layer, and summing"}
