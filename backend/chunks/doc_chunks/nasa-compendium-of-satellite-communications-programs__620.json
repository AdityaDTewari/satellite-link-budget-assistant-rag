An example of the coverage pattern is shown in Figure 20-22. The pattern is produced by the 1.52 m (60\"?) reflector and a special multihorn feed which employs four dual polarized horns, three 90 hybrid splitters on the transmit function, and 180 magic tees for the receive function. These components operate in conjunction with a rotary joint. A block diagram of the Westar communications transponder is shown in Fig­ ure 20-23. 20.5.4 The Western Union Earth Segment The Western Union earth stations are at Glenwood (also containing the satellite control center), Estill Fork, Lake Geneva, Steele Valley, and Cedar Hill. A diagram of the 51-foot cassegraine antenna used is given in Figure 20-24. Four of the five earth stations have been designed to operate unattended. The fifth, at Glenwood, serving New York City, is continuously manned, and monitors and controls the others by means of a fault monitoring and control (F/C subsystem), thus assuring economical and reliable operation. The Glenwood terminal can also be characterized by its three antennas which it needs to fulfill its dual role of communications terminal and operations control center. Two of these antennas, 15.5 m (51 ft.) diameter each, are for communications pur­ poses and for ranging and telemetry of in-service satellites. A pictorial diagram of a 15.5 m (51 ft.) diameter antenna is shown in Figure 20-24. The third, known as the Tracking, Telemetry, and Control (TT&C) Antenna, was used for ,the Westar I and II launches, and will be used for future launches. It also functions as a backup TT&C and test antenna for in-service satellites. The other terminals contain two antennas, one for each Westar satellite. The major characteristics of the communications and TT&C earth terminals are summa­ rized inTable 20-12."}
