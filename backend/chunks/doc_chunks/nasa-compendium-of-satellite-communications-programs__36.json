These repeaters were of the double conversion type with either hard limiting or AGC to ensure a constant input to the output power amplifier operating near saturation. Active repeaters were preferred over the passive systems of Echo or West Ford due to the higher system communication capacities afforded. Real time repeaters were the choice over the store and forward system of Courier because they resulted in simpler more reliable repeaters, and launch vehicle technology had progressed to the point that reasonably sized satellites could be in­ jected into orbits high enough to provide wide areas and relatively lengthy periods of mutual ground terminal visibility. Satellite communication frequencies had been reserved at 4 and 6 GHz for commercial operations and at 7 and 8 GHz for government operations. The former were the frequencies demonstrated in the Telstar program while the latter were employed on West Ford. Basic ground terminal technology had been developed on the Echo program in­ eluding: cooled maser and uncooled parametric amplifier low noise receive systems; FM feedback demodulators for threshold extension; and accurate tracking using pro­ grammed inputs, manual steering from optical settings or radar autotracking. This technology was upgraded on Project Telstar to display reliabilities compatible with commercial operations and precision autotracking of beacon or communications signals radiated from active satellites. By late 1963, cooled parametric amplifier low noise receive systems had also begun to appear in Projects Telstar and Relay. In 1963 and 1964, the orbit question was finally, for the most part, resolved by the results of the Syncom program, in favor of geostationary orbits. This completed 1-14 the early experimental phase of satellite communications wherein the fundamental system concepts that have continued to apply were established. Syncom demonstrated launch"}
