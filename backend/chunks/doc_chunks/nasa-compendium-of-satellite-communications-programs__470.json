A ground receive terminal used to provide a reference data base. Up to five transmitting modem signals are combined and transmitted. The test Was performed using the satellite ed in a back-to-back setup. 6-channel pCM communications using TO- 660 and the 288-kbps modem. SHP shelt- or terminal-to-SEF shelter terminal full duplex. Nature Of Results Obtained At M no degredation above 100 eleva­ tion angle. At lower angles signal deteriorated but data was obtained to at least 40. At SH? no representativedata is available. All test results agreed closely with theoretically predicted values or equipment specifications. Ground, ship nd submarine antennas performed well. Data was obtained on performance of various antenna designs for fixed wing aircraft and helicopters Basically the terminals performed with­ in nominal limits and met most of the electrical and mechanical requirements. Shipboard UHF terminals had consider­ ably higher noise temperatures (up to 200 0OK) than other UHF terminals (below 10000K). Both the UHF and SHF FM voice links performed satisfactorily and had suf­ficient system margin. Under stable conditions modem perfor­ mance via satellite is within 1dB (as determined by Eb/Novs error rate) of back-to-back performance., Interference appears to be unavoidable in 10MHZ band­ width UHF uplink and is present in 500 %Hz UHF band at times. Variations along the radio-wave propagation path also contribute to variations of several dB. In general, the tests demonstrated the capability of the TATs modem to operate satisfactorily with a aircraft Communic tion system including its aultzpath environment. About 3dB maximum fade, with a period of about 3.5 seconds, observed at elevation angle to the satellite less than five degrees. When using blade antenna modem lost lock dur­ 2ng 360-degree turns and with aircraft heading directly away from sub-satellite point. Using reference data base"}
