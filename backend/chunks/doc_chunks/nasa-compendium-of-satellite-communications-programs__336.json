With the exception of the high power TWTs on one transponder of ATS-3, the SHF transponders aboard the two spacecraft were virtually identical. Functional diagrams. depicting each of the three possible modes of the transponder (i. e., frequency translation, multiple access, and onboard camera) are given in Figures 13-2, 13-3, and 13-4. The VHF trans­ ponder on each spacecraft is illustrated in Figure 13-5. As indicated by the figure, the VHF transponder on ATS-3 differed from that on ATS-1 in that a capability existed to cross strap the VHF receiver to the transmitter of one of the SHF trans­ ponders. In this mode of operation, selectable by ground command, the SHF transponder was operated in the camera mode and the received VHF signal was down-converted to serve as the input to the SHF transponder's voltage controlled oscillator. 13. 2. 4 Ground Terminals Two of the three NASA ATS terminals, Rosman and Mojave, are large multi­ functional installations supporting numerous other NASA programs. Characteristics of the ATS related facilities at all three locations are summarized in Table 13-12. (See References 5 through 8 and 11. ) Major subsystems of the NASA ATS terminals are depicted in the functional block diagram of Figure 13-6. (6) Equipment and its characteristics are quite similar at all three sites with the major difference being in the size of the SHF antennas. The linear polarized SHF feeds employed at all three sites were compatible with the satellite'sotransmit and receive polarization. This polarization selection made polarization tracking necessary. For VHF communications, the T&C antenna was normally configured for circular polarization. With the linear polarization employed on the satellite,"}
