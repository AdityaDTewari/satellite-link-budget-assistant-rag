(29)(30)(8) This table includes the general results obtained. Ini considering received carrier power fading measurements, note that the horizons at Andover and Goonhilly are at about 20 and 0.-50 in elevation, tkespedtively. Most of the impairments to signal transmission were determined to be caused by the ground terminals. In addition to the tests mentioned in Table 6-10, a time syn­ chronization test was conducted. (29) Prec ision atomic clocks in the USA and UK were compared by transmitting pulses simultaneously in both directions. The accuracy of the method was believed to be about 20 ps and a difference in clock time of 2 milliseconds was found. 6.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS No operational traffic was handled during this program due to its experimental nature. Howevqr, the operational performance of the system, as the various experiments were conducted, was of consideiable interest as indicated by Program Objectives S and 4 listed in Table 6-I. OperatibnMl performance of the two satellites was as discussed in the description of program experiments in Paragraph 6. 5. The ground complex operations displayed that satellite communications ground terminals of satisfactory reliability to provide continuous commercial service were feasible. The performance demonstration included showing a capability for dependable satellite acquisitions and accurately tracking moving satellites. Satellite tracking turned out to be less difficult than expected and special purpose tracking antennas were determinednot necessary. Perhaps the most spectacular ground operational result was produced by the malfunction of the command circuit on Telstar I on November 24, 1962. (32) Subsequent ground diagnosis and attempts to. revive the spacecraft resulted in its being successfully commanded \"on\" again on January 3, 1963. This was a first in.satellite communications.
