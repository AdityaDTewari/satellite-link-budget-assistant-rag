Tosome, theidea that thecriteria are subject tochange isdisturbing. Within physical (andeconomic) constraints, itispreferable tomodify only thetechnical system parameters. Butthere maybecases where theinitial performance goals areunrealistic. For example, itsimply maynotbeworth theexpense ofalarge increase inEIRP in order togetacircuit availability ofgg.gg_ forsmall earth terminals at44 GHz. Section 7.2addresses systemperformance criteria, while paragraphs 7.3.1 through 7.3.3 areintroductions togeneral system design procedures. Theexperienced communication system engineer will probably befamiliar with thematerial covered inthese paragraphs, andmaytherefore skip them without loss ofcontinuity, andconcentrate onparagraphs 7.3.4through 7.3.6,which areaddressed tothemain issue athand, namely thespecific application of propagation data. 7.2.
