In the upper UHF. and SHF region, atmospheric noise is negligible. Galactic noise is not of great concern at frequencies- above about 1000 -MHz, nor is the influence'of the ionosphere, in either a quiet or disturbed state. At frequencies of some 3000 MHz and higher, the noise contributed by atmospheric attenuation is noticeable in sensitive receivers, and precipitation-induced attenuation begins to be important along long slant paths at frequencies above 6000 MHz. The use of lower frequencies will yield higher values of radiowave cross-section per unit mass for a given dipole thickness; at yery low frequencies,, however, the dipole thickness must be increased to preserve its shape and the greater mass would increase any possible spacecraft collision hazard. In addition, there are greater numbers of more powerful radio equipments operating at the lower frequencies. Signals scattered from a low freqiiency belt by these powerful equipments may cause interference. Consideration of these factors led to the choice of a band of frequencies near 8000 MHz for a test of the orbital scatter technique. The operating frequencies employed in Project West Fdrd are given in table 5-1. 5-4 Table 5-1. Project West Ford Frequencies Millstone Camp Parks Radar Communications.

The first of these was the measure­ ment of the propagation characteristics of the belt in sufficient detail to permit the design of possible future communications systems. The second goal was the achieve­ ment of digital data transmission at high rates consistent with the density of the dipoles in orbit. The fact that these two goals were to be achieved"}
