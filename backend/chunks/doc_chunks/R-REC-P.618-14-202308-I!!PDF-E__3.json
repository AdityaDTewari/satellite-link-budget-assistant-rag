Effects of the non -ionized atmosphere need to be considered at all frequencies, but become critical above about 1 GHz and for low elevation angles. These effe cts include: a) absorption in atmospheric gases; absorption, scattering and depolarization by hydrometeors (water and ice droplets in precipitation, clouds, etc.); and emission noise from absorbing media; all of which are especially important at frequencies above about 10 GHz; b) loss of signal due to beam -divergence of the earth -station antenna, due to the normal refraction in the atmosphere; c) a decrease in effective antenna gain, due to phase decorrelation across the antenna aperture, caused by irregularities in the refractive -index structure; d) relatively slow fading due to beam -bending caused by large -scale changes in refractive index; more rapid fading (scintillation) and variations in angle of arrival, due to small -scale variations in refractive index; e) possible limitations in bandwidth due to multiple scattering or multipath effects, especially in high -capacity digital systems; f) attenuation by the local environment of the ground terminal (buildings, trees, etc.); g) short -term variations of the ratio of attenuations at the up - and down -link frequencies, which may affect the accuracy of adaptive fade countermeasures; h) for non -geostationary satellite (non -GSO) systems, the effect of varying elevation angle to the satellite. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 3 Ionospheric effects (see Recommendation ITU -R P.531) may be important, particularly at frequencies below 1 GHz. For convenience these have been quantified for frequencies of 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 3 and 10 GHz in Table 1 for a high value of total electron content (TEC). The effects include: j) Faraday rotation: a linearly polarized wave propagating through the ionosphere undergoes a progressive rotation of the plane of polarization; k) dispersion, which results in a"}
