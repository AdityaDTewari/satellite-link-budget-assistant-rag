Phase I was conducted during 1967-1970 as a test and evaluation to deter­ mine the feasibility of using satellite communications in-support of NATO operations. The tests were conducted 'successfully with positive results. 2. Phase H implementation commenced in.March 1970 to provide an opera­ tional system during 1971-1974. Two satellites were launched success­ fully into synchronous orbit, with"}
