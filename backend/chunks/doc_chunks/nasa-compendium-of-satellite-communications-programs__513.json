Phase I had successfully completed its research and development objectives and since late 1967 had been providing a limited operational capability. The basic objectives for the Phase II DSCS are found in Table 17-1. 'The Phase II DSCS remains an integral part of the global DCS, and is designed to provide vital communications service to the United States and Allied Forces throughout the world by-means of satellites. It is composed of space, earth and control subsystb Ms. Table 17-1. Phase II DSCS Objectives Number Objectives' I Establish an operational military satellite communications system which will provide substantial increases in capacity and performance, together with a wider variety of services for users. 2 Satisfy approved requirements for DOD users, both DCS and Tactical, Presidential Communication, Diplomatic Telecom­ munications System, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and other specified allies. 3 Provide the following types of service: 1. Protected service for high priority users­ 2. Unprotected trunking and wideband service 3. Contingency service for crisis situations on a global basis. 17-1 The initial Phase II DSCS spacecraft procurement package consisted of six sat­ ellites, which were designed and manufactured by TRW, Inc., under contract to the Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) Air Force Systems Command. The Phase II satellites are spin stabilized and have two steerable narrow beam (NB) (20 X2 ) and one earth coverage (EC) (17 ) antennas on a despun platform. The effec­ tive radiated powers per antenna are 40 dBW (NB) and 28 dBW (EC). The antennas can be cross-strapped to permit any antenna to receive and transmit via any other. The various transponders and cross-straps have different band widths selected on the basis of expected needs. The satellites have tunnel diode inputs and TWT output amplifiers"}
