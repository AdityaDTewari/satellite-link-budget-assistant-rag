TV and movie cameras mounted in the Thor followed and photographed the payload from ejection through reentry. In the first test, the balloon blew up due to excessive inflation pressure. During the second test, a different balloon inflatant resulted in successful balloon deployment, but pressurization was not great enough to provide a good reflecting surface. As a result of the suborbital tests, it was concluded that a thorough evaluation of inflation characteristics was necessary by means of full-scale balloon statics ground tests. These were conducted in the dirigible hanger at the Naval Air Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey. Following further refinement of the pressurization system during these tests, Echo II was successfully launched from the Western Test Range (i.e., Vandenberg Air Force Base, California) into a near polar low altitude orbit. Immediately after the first pass, it was determined that internal pressurization reached no more than 6. 895 X 106 newton/meter 2 (1000 psi) as compared to the 34.47 x 106 -41.37 X 106 newton/meter 2 (5000-6000 psi) expected, and the balloon was rotating about an inertial axis with a spin period of about 100 seconds. (7 ) These occurrences pro­ duced forces within the satellite shell that caused the surface to wrinkle somewhat. As a result, unexpectedly high scintillations of the reflected RF signals were encountered. In spite of this, the balloon remained an effective passive communications reflector and demonstrated that a lightweight spherical balloon could maintain its shape and surface 3-3 characteristics, even after the loss of inflatant pressure. Valuable information was contributed towards meeting all the program objectives listed in Table 3-1. Numerous terminals from various countries conducted communications operations with the Echo satellites in response to an open invitation by NASA for worldwide utiliza­ tion. Some of the major"}
