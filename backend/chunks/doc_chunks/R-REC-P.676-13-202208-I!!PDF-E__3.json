The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly, considering a) that there is a need to predict the slant path gaseous attenuation, phase nonlinearity, atmospheric bending, excess atmospheric path length and downwelling and upwelling noise temperatures due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 1 000 GHz for arbitrary known pressure, temperature and water vapour height profiles; b) that there is a need to estimate the instantaneous slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 350 GHz when the instantaneous surface pressure, surface temperature and surface water vapour density or in tegrated water vapour content statistics are known either from local data, a reference profile, or referenced digital maps; c) that there is a need to estimate the statistics of slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 350 GHz when the surface pressure, surface temperature and surface water vapour density or integrated water vapour content statistics are known; d) that there is a need to provide a Weibull approximation to the slant path water vapour attenuation for use in Recommendation ITU -R P.1853 , recommends 1 that, for arbitrary temperature, pressure and water vapour density height profiles known from local data (e.g. radiosonde measurements or any of the reference profiles in Annexes 1, 2 or 3 of Recommendation ITU -R P.835 ), the method in Annex 1 should be used to calculate the slant path gaseous attenuation, phase nonlinearity, atmospheric bending, excess atmospheric path length and downwelling and upwelling noise temperatures due to oxygen and water vapour"}
