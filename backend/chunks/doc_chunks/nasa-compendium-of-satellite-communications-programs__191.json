It was subsequently-upgraded in performance. capabilities. Lincoln Labs supplemented, this terminal in late 1966 with. a small truck-based- UHF terminal .e 1 ~(6) -I I employing a 12-dB gain helix antenna... This- terminal was designated LET-4 as it was preceded by three transportable SHF Lincoln Experimental terminals (see Section 9.2.1). LET-4 was- a majorparticipant in. LES-5 and LES-6 testing. In addition.to these terminals,: a-host of.mobileter-minals built by the three major U. S. armed -services- used the,satellites., These- includedfixed wing aircraft,, helicopter, surface ship,. ,submarine,. van, small truck, jeep, .and manually carried terminals(33)(34)(35)(36). The latter included small terminals-that can be carried by one man and larger terminals: carriedby a team of men. Fixed wing aircraft -outfitted. with these terminals included B-52s, ,C-135s, and P-3s. Many of-the aircraft tests used airplanes-based: at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. Heliqopters, provided\" witk terminals- included the-UH-iF and UH-ID aircraft. Surface ship-,t6rminals'-involved In.tests-included the USS Providenqe, USS Guadalcanal-i USS Threadfin, -USS Picuda. .USS Pocono, USCGC Glacier, and.USS Leahy. Submarine terminals participating In: tests inpcluded the- USS. Tullibee and USS Thornback. Army tests of vehicular aid' manually transported-terminals.were I conducted at-Fort Monmouth; New -Jersey and,:Fort Clayton, Panama Canal Zone .among other places; Various-fixed or semf-fixed.stations making, some use of LES-5 and LES-6 were located at Rome, New York;, St;.. Petersburg,; Florida;. San.Diego, California; New London, Connecticut; Patuxent-River, Maryland and St. Inigoes, Maryland. Spacecraft telemetry was obtaine&by-Lincoln- Laboratory facilities at Camp Parks,, California; Millstone Hill, Massachusetts; and Lexington, Massachusetts. Additional locations receiving. special, installations of telemetry equipment included 9-24 Cape Kennedy, Florida and Guam Island.. The main command station was Lexington, Massachusetts'. Spacecraft launchings were provided by the U. S. Air Force. The UHF LES program resulted in numerous advancements in technology"}
