(32) Subsequent ground diagnosis and attempts to. revive the spacecraft resulted in its being successfully commanded \"on\" again on January 3, 1963. This was a first in.satellite communications. The ability to. devise revised command signals to bypass radiation damaged transistors in the command decoder were instrumental in the successful results obtained. 6-13 Table 6-10. Telstar I and I1 Communication Experiments Type Experiment Nature of Results Obtained 1. Received Carrier Power Measured values, in general, agreed with pre­ dicted values when range and spin axis aspect angle of satellite are taken into account. Varia­ tions in received power clearly showed satellite rotation, changes in aspect angle and changes in -range. No noticeable multipath fading observed at Andover for elevation angles above about 49 or at Goonhilly for elevation angles above about 3. 2. Frequency Baseband response essentially flat up to 5 MHz Responses when conventional FM receiver was used. For FMFB receiver response flat up to 3 MHz. All of response limitations appeared to be due to ground terminal equipment employed. 3. Noise Baseband noise performance, for various signals employed, defined in Table 6-9. Measurements for impulse noise indicated only random thermal noise'present. Satellite repeater noise spectrum on Telstar I observed to display considerable peaking around communications carrier fre­ quency. This gives effective noise figure over 20 MHz of about 16.5 dB +2 dB. 4. Amplitude and Phase Measurements of envelope delay, differential Distortion gain and phase, and intermodulation noise taken. Performance measured for television and 600­ channel telephony indicate objectives* for these measurements met. Additionally, no audio to video crossmodulation interference observed and video to audio crossmodulation not signifi­ cant. 5. Doppler Shift Measured and calculated curves of Doppler shift agreed within 1 kHz over period of about 45 mins."}
