Prior to modification, the performance of Goonhilly was about 3 dB down as compared to Andover and Pleumeur Bodou. The modification improved the terminal's performance by reducing profile inaccuracies of the reflector, reducing aperture blocking frotm the feed support structure, and reducing feeder losses. Character­ istics of the Andover, Goonhilly, and Raisting earth terminals, as configured for op­ eration with Early Bird, were as.indicated in Table 10-18. Second generation earth terminals were developed to take advantage of the wider bandwidths of the INTELSAT ITsatellites. These earth stations employed more ad­ vanced equipment than had previously been available, including solid-state designs, masers of wider bandwidth, Cassegrain feed antenna systems, and dual carrier re­ ceiving chains. A technical summary of three typical second generation earth stations that participated in operations with INTELSAT H satellites is given in Table 10-19. The original INTELSAT I terminals were also used to operate in the INTELSAT H sys­ tem. These terminals were not significantly modified from their Early Bird configu­ rations. In building the third generation stations for operation with INTELSAT II, new 500-MHz bandwidth cooled parametric amplifiers were developed, as well as 500-MHz 10-41 COMMUNICATION FILTERS/ANTENNACOMMUNICATION ELECTRONICS POWER SUBSYSTEM' DESPIN SUBSYSTEM PROPULSION SUBSYSTEM TELEMETRY AND COMMAND STRUCTURE WIRE HARNESS APOGEE MOTOR BOOSTER/SPACECRAFT INTERFACE Figure 10-7.
