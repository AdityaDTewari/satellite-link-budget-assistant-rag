In order to cope with intersymbol inter­ ference due to the dispersive nature of the channel, successive transmissions used different frequency pairs and were detected in separate receivers operating in parallel. Two message sources were available to the transniitter: a fixed word repetition and a standard 60-wpm teletype. In addition, a digitized PCM system was constructed to pro­ vide voice communication in the e~rly stages of the experiment. On May 14 and 15, speech was transmitted using the PCM system. The received speech was intelligible and its general quality varied as the'PlR IN ratio fluctuated about a mean of about 53 dB. Between May 14 and June 18, eight communications experiments were performed. This cqvered the period of time from shortly after initial dispensing to roughly closure time. During all the experiments, therefore, the belt was-incomplete and in each run that portion of the belt spanning the central densest spot was employed. The experimental results were generally in fairly good agreement with the theory. For the most part, the theory overbounned the actual error probability at most by a factor of 2. In summary, the performance of the data comm­ unieations system was found to be in substantial agreement with a theory which assumed the use of an optimum receiver. This is consistent with the above result that the scattering function was adequately described by the two parameters B and L, since the signals were designed under that assumption. 5.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS No operational traffic was carried by this experimental system. The operation­ al reliability of the space subsystem was qffite high due to its passive nature. Finally, the operational performance of the earth terminals employed in the experi­ ments was good, as expected. 5-14 References 1. C. F. J. Overhage and W. H. Radford, \"The Lincoln"}
