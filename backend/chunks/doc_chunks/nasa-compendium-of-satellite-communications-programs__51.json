Three of these were actively participating in domestic satellite communications, one via its own satellite (Western Union via Westar), the other two via leased circuits on Westar or Telesat (Anik). Major contributions of the satellite communication programs completed or in progress as of mid-1974 are summarized in Table 1-2. A whole new industry was brought into being in the 1960s built on technology demonstrated by experimental satellites such as Relay, Telstar, and Syncom. Simi­ larly, rapid growth of existing capabilities and initiation of new space communications applications, such as high rate information transfer, data collection, educational broadcast, and traffic management, are occurring during the 70s, based on the results of experiments described in this document. 1-25 Table 1-2. Summary of Major Contributions (1 of 3) Program Primary Results Score (1) Demonstrated feasibility of employing active orbiting satellites to relay mes­ sages over intercontinental distances. Echo (1) Displayed feasibility of erecting and maintaining large lightweight structures adequate to serve as passive reflectors in space. (2) Verified that conventional microwave theories for determining path loss could be applied to satellite links. (3) Fostered development of ground terminal technology including low noise receiver preamplifiers, FMFB receivers, accurate tracking techniques and terminal operating procedures. Courier (1) Displayed feasibility of high capacity high rate digital store and forward satel­ lite system. (2) Demonstrated difficulty of attaining lifetime and reliability need for operational systems. West Ford (1) Showed that X-Band dipoles can be dispersed into a passive reflecting belt. (2) Displayed that belt is predictably affected by solar radiation pressure and does not interfere with radio astronomy. (3) Demonstrated that communications are feasible and multipath time delay and frequency smear are predictable. Telstar (1) Demonstrated performance and reliability, adequate for commercial opera­"}
