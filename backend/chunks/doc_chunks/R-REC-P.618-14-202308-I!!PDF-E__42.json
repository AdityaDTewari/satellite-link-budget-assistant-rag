These are greater than any bandwidth allocated for Earth -space communications below 40 GHz, and the rain attenuation will therefore be far more important than its frequency dependence. 7 Angle of arrival Elevation -angle errors due to refraction are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. The total angular refraction (the increase in apparent elevation) is about 0.65°, 0.35° and 0.25°, for elevation angles of 1°, 3° and 5°, respectively, for a tropical mar itime atmosphere. For a polar continental climate the corresponding values are 0.44°, 0.25° and 0.17°. Other climates will have values between these two extremes. The day -to-day variation in apparent elevation is of the order of 0.1° (r.m.s.) at 1° elevati on, but the variation decreases rapidly with increasing elevation angle. Short -term angle -of-arrival fluctuations are discussed in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. Short -term variations, due to changes in the refractivity -height variation, may be of the order of 0.02° (r.m.s.) at 1° elevation, again decreasing rapidly with increasing elevation angle. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the effect of the short -term changes in the refractivity -height distribution and the effect of random irregularities superimposed on that distribution. A statistical analysis of the short -term angle-of-arrival fluctuation at 19.5 GHz and at an elevation angle of 48° suggests that both in elevation and azimuth directions, standard deviations of angle -of-arrival fluctuations are about 0.002° at the cumulative time percentage of 1%. The seasonal varia tion of angle -of-arrival fluctuations suggests that the fluctuations increase in summer and decrease in winter. The diurnal variation suggests that they increase in the daytime and decrease both in the early morning and the evening. 8 Calculation of long -term statistics for non -GSO paths The prediction methods described above were derived for applications"}
