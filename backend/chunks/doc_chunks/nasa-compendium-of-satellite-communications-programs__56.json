All ground stations were linked by both telephone and HF radio to the system control center at the Signal Corps Laboratory in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The design of the system was based on providing two modes of operation -as a delayed repeater and as a real time active repeater. In the delayed repeater mode, the satellite would record information transmitted to it upon reception of a suitable command signal from a ground station.. Upon reception of a different command signal, the satellite would transmit the previously stored information back to the originating ground station. The second mode of operation, that of a real time repeater, was obtained by the use of yet another command signal which activated the satellite as a radio relay repeater station with the recording mechanism bypassed. The capacity of the system was one voice channel or seven 60-wpm teletype channels, frequency division multiplexed. 2-2 The satellite receiver was an FM \"pagingt\" receiver -the 4p,- often used by doctors and salesmen to receive telephone calls when away from their offices. A commercial transistor model was .modified extensively through the addition of an RF stage using selected transistors to increase its sensitivity. A vacuum tube transmitter from an FM handle-talkie was repackaged and modified through the ad­ dition of a high power (8 watts) output stage. A continuous loop magnetic tape re­ corder developed at the Signal Corps Laboratory was used as the message storing device. 23 meters (75 feet) of magnetic tape was used to provide 4 minutes of audio recording. The control unit responded to. command signals from the ground and activated the receiver, the transmitter, or the magnetic tape recorder. Three modes of operation were commanded -record, playback, and real time. Since the satellite was expected to orbit"}
