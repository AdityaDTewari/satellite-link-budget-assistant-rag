TATS Functional Block Diagram At the receiver, the amplitude of the envelope out of each of eight matched filters was sampled and quantized to one of 16 levels at the end of each T -secC pulse interval (37) . Seven sets of these measurements, corresponding to one code word, were used to generate 64 numbers related to the likelihood that each of the 64 possible code words was the one actually being received. The maximum likelihood 6-bit information word was outputed each. 8 T seconds.c Bandspreading was accomplished by generating a new base or carrier fre­ quency in each pulse interval to which the frequency selected in that interval by the input code word was added 3 7 ) . The carrier hopping pattern consisted of a repetitive sequence of seven frequencies chosen from a larger set of possible carrier frequencies. Since the modulation frame contained 8 pulses or chips, the 9,-30 carrier frequency for each chip position within the -modulationiframe was, cycled through the carrier hopping pattern. This guaranteed frequency diversity in the sync measurement in the presence of selective fading. The hopping patterns were selected such that each pattern used the whole trans­ mitted bandwidth (i. e., 500 kHz or 10 kHz as selected) and the number of pattern overlaps between members of the selected set were small for all possible time shifts. The first property provided The diversity necessary to combat frequency selective fading due to multipath and RFI. The second property-"}
