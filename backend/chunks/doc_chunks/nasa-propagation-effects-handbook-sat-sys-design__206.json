Self-interference mayarise from crosstalk between frequency bands, orthogonalpolarizations, antenna patterns,orcombinations ofthethree, as determined bythesystem architecture. 7.3.6.5 Iterate System Design andAnalysis. This phase n_edslittle explanation. Iftheinitial design doesnot, peranalysis, deliverthelevel ofperformance required, thedesignmust bechanged insomeway. Various trade-off techniques maybeused toassist thedesign engineer indeciding what tochange. Thenext sectiondescribes some ofthese techniques. Insome cases, acritical lookatthesystemrequirements themselves must betaken.

Inanactual, real-world design, more refined analyses anditerations would beneeded. Both oftheexamples used a particular terminal rain rate andelevation angle assumption. Forareal system with adistribution ofterminals invarious locations, considerable refinement oftheapproaches would bepossible, andcould have significant impact inreduction ofpower requirements and/or outage times. Also, the examples didnotillustrate theconsideration ofcriteria other than long term (outage percentage) statistics. 7.3.7Supplementary Design Tools Techniquesareavailable forassigning rain margins andallocating link performance parameters with more precision than hasbeen used inthe examples. Wedescribe twoofthem here andprovide references toothers. Thefirst technique incorporates rain attenuation, skynoise temperature increase duetorain, andsatellite repeater non-linearity into thecarrier-to-noise trade-off relation given earlier.
