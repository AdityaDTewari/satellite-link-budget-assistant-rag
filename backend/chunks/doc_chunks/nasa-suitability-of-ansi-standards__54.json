Additionally, 111989010985-081 efficient control protocols canbedesigned andevaluated fornewgenerations ofswitched satellit_ systems. Fin=fly, ascommunication satellites like ACTS become pven more advanced and the TDM switchIL,g becomes more sophisticated, one can envision the _ate]lite asthecentral hub ofalarge, broadband ISDN. These satellite- augmented ISDN's could b_part ofalong-haul carrier's system, supplement a regional carrier's remote service area access, interconnect .,obile communication servines directly with local orlong-.haul communication systems, oroccommodate \"software bundled\" private ISDNs tot many geographically dispersed companies orinstituticns. Intrying tomarket anyofthese diverse services, demonstrating andspecifying thesystem performance interms ofthe standards discussed here becomes critical. 6.ACKNOWI _DCMFaNTS Theauthor thanks Thomas Cony andRonald Schertler ofNational Aeronautics andSpace Administration (NASA) fortheir explaaati_mq ahd information onthe ACTS I.BRsystem.
