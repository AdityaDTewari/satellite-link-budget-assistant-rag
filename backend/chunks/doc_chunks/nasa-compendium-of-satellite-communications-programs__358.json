Altitude control and station-keeping maneuvers produced ATS-4 (i. e., ATS-D prior to launch) fell short of its intended synchronous orbit when the Centaur failed to re-ignite for a second burn leaving the spacecraft in a low altitude parking orbit with the Centaur still attached. Shortly after second burn failure, the ATS-4-Centaur conglomerate went into a tumble about a traverse axis. Subsequent maneuvers by the spacecraft attitude control systems were unable to completely correct this condition. As a result the gravity gradient system could not be tested and little information was obtained on the other satellite experiments although all subsystems appeared to be operating properly. Among the operations accomplished was a partial deployment of the stabilizing booms, boom scissoring and successful firing of the ion engines. 13-32 Table 13-20. Location Bedford,.
