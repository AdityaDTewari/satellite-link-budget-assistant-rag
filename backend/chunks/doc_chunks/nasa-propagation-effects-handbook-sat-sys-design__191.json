Analyze systemperformance,first atthepathlevel, then onthe end-to-end performance level. 10) Ifperformancemeets requirements closely, stop.Otherwise, adjust design andrepeat analysis. Ifdesigncannot bemade to meet requirements, consider changing requirements. Thesestepswill beconsideredinmoredetailintheremainder of this chapter. Themost difficultstep is4above. Itisnotpossible to defineastep-by-step \"cookbook\" procedure forthis phase ofthedesign process. Asindicated above, these stepsmaybegroupedinto three major phases. Itisinthethird phase that propagationphenomena anddataare explicitly considered. Since theemphasis ofthis Handbookispropagation,a detailedexposition ofthefirst twophases isnotappropriate. However, some discussionisrequired because both performance criteria andthesystem engineering areprofoundly influenced bythepronounced propagation effects which apply above 10GHz. 7.3.4 Specifics ofApplication_ Initial Phase Theinitial phase containsthree steps: D1) 2) 3)performancerequirements conversiontoreceived CNRrequirement initial designchoices 369 i¸,._ i\"./! Twoexampleswill beusedtoillustrate thedesignprocedure.The first step,tospecifyperformance requirements, isnowcarried outforthe examples. Additional information will begiven fortheexample systems as they aredevelopedfurther. EXAMPLE 1(Digital transmission system) Requirement: One-way biterror rateof 10-6'or better foratleast 80%of thetime, and10-4orworse foramaximum of1_ofthetime. EXAMPLE2(Analog, duplextelephone trunking system) Requirement: Nomore than 10,000 pWOp foratleast 80%oftheworst month, andnomore than 100,000 pWOp, except for0.3% ofthetime orless. (More than 500,000pWOp isoutage condition.) Thesecond andthird steps areperformed inparallel. Conversion from thebasic performance criteria toreceiver CNRrequirements involves application ofmodulation equations. Toapply theequations, thetype of modulation* andother system parameters such astotal linkcapacity needto have been selected.Fortheabove twoexamples:,\" (..
