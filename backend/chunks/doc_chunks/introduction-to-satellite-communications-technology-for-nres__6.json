A reflector and feed: This is the ''dish\" that is the most visible component of the system. The dish focuses the signal on the feed which sends it on. The size and shape of the dish are a function of the frequencies used and the strength of the signal. The larger the dish, the smaller the area of the sky it can see. This seems counter-intuitive but it is true. 2. Outdoor equipment: This equipment isolates the signals to those we are interested in and amplifies the signals (both send and receive). The equipment to change the ffequency range to those the satellite expects (up and down converters) from L-Band can be either indoor or outdoor. 3. Cable: Cable connects the antenna to the inside equipment. 4. A satellite modem that operates in L-Band (this could be separate modulators and demodulators): These modems do more than the common terrestrial versions in doing 1 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN A/D and D/A conversion. They also define the signal method, do error correction using redundancy coding, do time and frequency multiplexing, and perform link monitoring. Satellite links are often"}
