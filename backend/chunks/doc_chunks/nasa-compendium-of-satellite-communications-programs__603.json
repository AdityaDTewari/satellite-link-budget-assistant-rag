AT&T/Comsat General/GSAT Domsat System Frequency/Polarization Plan plan. The earth terminals with 30-meter (98-foot) diameter parabolic antennas will be capable of providing 1200 one-way voice circuits through a transponder, under single carrier per transponder operation. 20.3.3 Spacecraft The Comsat General satellites will be spin stabilized with feedhorns arranged to provide spot beam coverage to the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. A photograph of a satellite model is shown in Figure 20-5. The CONUS beam coverage service area is indicated in Figure 20-6, and the Alaska beam coverage service area is indicated in Figure 20-7. A summary of the characteristics of the satellite is given in Table 20-2. A block diagram of the communications subsystem is provided in Figure 20-8. Especially note­ worthy are the beam-channel feed arrangements and the presence of equalizers in each transmit channel. 20.3.4 The AT&T/GSAT Ground Terminals The proposed joint AT&T and GSAT Domsat system involves seven earth terminals: four AT&T terminals near San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta; and three GSAT terminals near Hawaii, Los Angeles, and Florida. Thus, AT&T has proposed to withdraw one of its original applications (the Los Angeles terminal) and GSAT has pro­ posed to withdraw two of its original applications (the New York and Chicago terminals). The AT&T and GSAT terminals will have paraboloid antennas 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter. The"}
