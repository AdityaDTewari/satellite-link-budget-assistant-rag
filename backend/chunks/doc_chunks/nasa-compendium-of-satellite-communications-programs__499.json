NATO SATCOM Phase III is being planned as an evolutionary follow-on to the Phase II system to provide satellite communications during 1975-1980. Higher powered satellites, comparable in capability to the U. S. DSCS Phase II satellites, were procured in early 1973 to replenish the space subsystem by late 1975. Ten earth terminals 13-meter (42-foot) antennas) will be added to the Phase II ground system at the following locations: * Azores 0 Landau, Germany * Bodo, Norway * Latania, Italy * Halifax, N. S. 0 Puerto Rico * Iceland 0 Perth, Scotland * Izmir, Turkey 0 Verona, Italy Two large transportable terminals (6.1-meter (20-foot) antennas) will also be procured to provide satellite communications in contingency situ­ ations. Some U.S. and U.K. national ships, when under the operational command of NATO, will be equipped with terminals for communicating through the Phase II satellite. The NATO SATCOM system will be used primarily as a transmission subsystem to provide trunks between the tandem telephone circuit switches and store-and-forward message switches 16-3 Table 16-2.
