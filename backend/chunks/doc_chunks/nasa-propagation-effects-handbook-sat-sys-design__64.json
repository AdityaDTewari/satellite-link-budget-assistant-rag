Thedifferential phase shift along thepropagationpath wasfound tovary between 0.160 and1.170 perkmat16.5 GHz,values comparable tothat ofmoderate rainfall. Unlike rain, however, snowproduces very little differentialattenuation. The differential phase shift insnowshouldproduce measureable depolarization on Earth-space paths, butlittle ornodirect experimental evidence ofthis has been reported. Graupel, orsnowpellets,mayalso exhibit someanisotropy, and resulting depolarization. Hail particles, which have arough spherical s3A_metry, probably would notcause depolarization.

Itshould enable the system designer toproperly interpret experimental data andassess system performance, considering both themedium's depolarizingeffects onthewave andthewave's interaction with theantenna system. Most ofthis development isfrom Stutzman (1977). 4.2.1 Specifying thePolarization State ofaWave Inthemost general case, thetipoftheelectric field vector ofa plane electromagnetic wave traces outanellipse intheplane perpendicular to thedirection ofProPagation. Thepolarization state ofthewave isgiven by specifying theshape andOrientationoftheellipse, along with thesense of rotation ofthefield vector. Figure4.2-1 shows thegeneral polarization ellipse anddefines thenotation.
