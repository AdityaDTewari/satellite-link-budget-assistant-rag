The television station is comprised of the following equip­ ment: 1. A 9.8-meter (32-foot) diameter focal fed antennawhich has been designed for ease of erection on a variety.of locations. When dismantled, the antenna is assembled in a configuration which can be towed on any highway by a standard haulage unit. 2. A communications trailer, also road transportable, housing theequipment mentioned in paragraphs Ito 5. 3. Two complete up-chaiiis capable of taking two television feeds and associated audio. in standard format and levels and modulating, up-converting and ampli­ fying the signdls to the appropriate frequencies, levels, etc. Frequencies corresponding to any of the twelve satellite RF channels may be selected by means of a front panel switch. This multi-frequency capability allows great * flexibility in achieving frequency coordination at any location and permits the use of any RF channel assigned for use. 18-42 4. A frequency agile receiver capable of monitoring any of the twelve channels. This is used essentially as an operational monitoring device; however, the station could be equipped to receive network quality television by substitu­ tion of a higher performance low noise amplifier. 5. Picture and waveform monitoring equipment. 6. A completely self-contained diesel-electric power generation and distribu­ tion system.to operate the entire station. This unit, together with its fuel tank and control system, is also trailer mounted. The transportable message station is designed in a form which is suitable for air transportatiqn by small aircraft such as the Twin-Otter. The station consists basically of the following: 1. A 3.7-meter (12-foot) diameter focal fed antenna so constructed as, to be readily. erected by two technicians in a few hours. Provision is made to permit the antenna to be mounted on a variety of sites by the inclusion"}
