These beacons were left off the payload during the initial orbital launch attempt, since they had not been previously qualified by a vertical test. Following these activities, Echo I was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida, into a near circular low altitude inclined orbit. It was an immediate resounding success, being large and reflective enough to be seen against the nighttime sky with the naked eye. During its lifetime, valuable information was contributed towards meeting all the program objectives listed in Table 3-1. In particular, the feasibility of passive satellite communications was demonstrated. 3-2 The one drawback of the Echo I balloon was that it was not rigid enough to remain smooth and spherical under the deforming forces of atmospheric drag and solar pressure after its pressurizing gas leaked out. (1)(2)(6) Its shape deteriorated signi­ ficantly within a few week.s after launch. In recognition of this, efforts were inititated in late 1960 to develop a second generation Echo balloon that was rigid enough to withstand the deforming forces. Once again, static ground tests, vacuum chamber drop tests, and vertical space tests were conducted. The first two groups of tests were again conducted in the dirigible hanger at Weeksville, North Carolina, and at Langley Research Center, respectively. The two vertical launch tests occurred 15 January 1962 and 18 July 1962, employing a Thor rocket from Cape Kennedy. TV and movie cameras mounted in the Thor followed and photographed the payload from ejection through reentry. In the first test, the balloon blew up due to excessive inflation pressure. During the second test, a different balloon inflatant resulted in successful balloon"}
