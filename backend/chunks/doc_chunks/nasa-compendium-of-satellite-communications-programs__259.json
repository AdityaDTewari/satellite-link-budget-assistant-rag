Figure 10-7 shows the satellite configuration and pinpoints the subsystem of IV which had to be converted to arrive at the communica­ tions channel's increased capability offered by IVA. 10.4 GROUND TERMINALS The INTELSAT ground complex that provided communications through the Early Bird satellite consisted to a large extent of modified versions of terminals initially constructed to participate in Telstar and Relay program experiments (see Sections 6 and 7). The participating terminals were listed in Table 10-6. The Andover earth station, originally built for Telstar, was modified during the period July 1964 through March 1965. The Goonhilly Downs earth station, also an original Telstar terminal, was withdrawn from service in September 1964 for modification to work with Early Bird. Prior to modification, the performance of Goonhilly was about 3 dB down as compared to Andover and Pleumeur Bodou. The modification improved the terminal's performance by reducing profile inaccuracies of the reflector, reducing aperture blocking frotm the feed support"}
