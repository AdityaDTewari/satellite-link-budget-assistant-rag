C.Lee Path Loss. 3.Each propagation path loss model has its own requirements that need to be met in order to be utilized correctly. 4.The Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) is used as the foundation for all propagation path loss models. Used extensively for predicting Point - to-Point, fixed, propagation path loss. Typically underestimates the path loss actually experienced for mobile communications.
