ITU-R P. 838-3 1 RECOMMENDATION ITU-R P.838 -3 Specific attenuation model for rain for use in prediction methods (Question ITU -R 201/3) (1992 -1999 -2003 -2005) The ITU Radiocommunication Assembly, considering a) that there is a need to calculate the attenuation due to rai n from a knowledge of rain rates, recommends 1 that the following procedure be used. The specific attenuation R (dB/km) is obtained from the rain rate R (mm/h) using the power -law relationship:  kRR (1) Values for the coefficients k and  are determined as functions of frequency, f (GHz), in the range from 1 to 1 000 GHz, from the following equations, which have been developed from curve -fitting to power -law coefficients derived from scattering calculations:                4 1102 10 10 loglogexp log jk k jj j cf mcbfa k (2)                5 1α 102 10loglogexp j jj j cf mcbfa (3) where: f: frequency (GHz) k: either kH or kV : either H or V. Values for the constants for the coefficient kH for horizontal polarization are given in Table 1 and for the coefficient kV for vertical polarization in Table 2. Table 3 gives the values for the constants for the coefficient H for horizontal polarization, a nd Table 4 gives the values for the constants for the coefficient V for vertical polarization. 2 Rec.
