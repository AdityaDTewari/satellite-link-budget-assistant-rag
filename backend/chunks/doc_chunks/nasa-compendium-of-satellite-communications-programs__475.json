Recovery ship-to-shore communications. (7 ) 4. High-power UHF ground-based transceivers were used and the aircraft and ships were equipped with TACSAT terminals. Communications during all operational phases were outstanding. In addition, the TACSAT SHE communication band was used to provide satellite relay of live television coverage of the moon landing from the continental United States to Alaska. A modified army SHF terminal in Anchorage, Alaska, was used for this purpose. 14-21 After termination of the formal test program and special operations described above, TACSAT 1 was used for actual operational military circuits until December 1972. From launch to December 1972 (when active use of the TACSAT 1 ceased), all major satellite subsystems performed well with two exceptions: a nutation, anomaly ahd a drop in UHF ERP. It was found that the nutation angle, instead of decaying after sep­ aration, maintained a fairly steady level of about 1 degree. The nutation disappeared eventually but reappeared at intervals. A study indicated that certain rotor destabiliz­ ing forces were much larger than anticipated. These can be decreased by minor changes in the design of future spacecraft. The nutation angle is not large enough to affect communication system performance. The UHF ERP dropped after several months from 38.4 dBW to 35.4 dBW ± 2 dB with erratic variation about the mean. In addition, the transmitting antenna pattern changed significantly. Laboratory tests demonstrated that all the phenomena observed could have been caused by a short circuit to the ground plane or an open circuit on the first turn of any of the four outer helix antennas. In addition, there were three component failures, none of which affected system operation; one of the four earth sensors behaved erratically, one of the redundant de­ coders of the TT and C subsystem produced extraneous"}
