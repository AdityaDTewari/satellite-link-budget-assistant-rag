Minimum mass configurations generally occur at that design point where the mass required for the antenna with its installa- tion is approximately equal to the sum of the mass of the transmitter, its installation and power supply allocation. Thus a switched beam or electrically steered beam may be an appropriate design for the higher data rate users. In this case an unobstructed field of view is required for the installation of any element in a switched beam configuration and a complete unobstructed field of view is required for all elements in an electrically steered beam configuration. Mechanical gimbals may also be employed for high gain antennas where the mass of a phased array antenna would be prohibitive. It is judged that antennas I meter or more in diameter should use mechanical beam steering. Such an antenna would have a peak gain of 25 dB at 2.25 GHz. It may then be concluded that mechanical beam steering would not be appropriate for the low data rate class of user satellites. 4-13 4.2.3 Antenna Polarization Terrestrially-generated RFI is assumed to consist of all polarizations of equal power; that is to say, if one were to measure the power level of the RFI with a linear polarized antenna, or a right-hand circularly polarized antenna, etc., the power level in each case would be the same. Therefore, there is no advantage in designing an antenna with any particular polarization in an attempt to reduce the level of the RFI. However, the receive signal level can be increased by adjusting the polarization of the transmitting antenna to the receive antenna or vice versa. 4.2.4 Low Gain Semi-Omnidirectional"}
