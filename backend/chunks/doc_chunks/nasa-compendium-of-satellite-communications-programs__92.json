(2) (3) (6) A block diagram depicting the-basic electrical configuration of the satellite is shown in Figure 4-1, (3) The considerable redundancy incorporated reflected the concern over spacecraft reliability that existed at that time. The design expectation was for a 1 year in orbit lifetime. A special acquisition transmitter, separate from the telemetry transmitter, was supplied. While in the acquistion mode, the two VHF receivers were alternately activated to \"listen\" for ground terminal signals, on a part-time basis. The cycling of the receivers was such that an active receiver was listening only about 10 percent of the time. 4-4 Table 4-5.
