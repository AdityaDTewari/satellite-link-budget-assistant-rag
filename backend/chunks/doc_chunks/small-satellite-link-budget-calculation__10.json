The change in frequency can be calculated as \u0001 f=\u0001v cf0 This shift increases with the frequency of the carrier f0and in LEO. At 800 Km and 435 MHz, the doppler shift can be \u00069:76KHz at low elevation angles The receiver must compensate this shift estimating the position of the satellite or it must increase the bandwith and the noise Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 35/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsRate carrier / noise Doppler e ect Eb=N0 Receiver sensitivity Interference Eb=N0 Eb=N0 For the purposes of link budget analysis, the most important aspect of a given modulation technique is the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) necessary for a receiver to achieve a speci ed level of reliability in terms of BER Eb=N0=SNR\u0001b Rbwhere Rbis the system data rate and Ebis the energy per bit of information In general, the modulation technique dictates the required system bandwidth Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 36/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsRate carrier / noise Doppler e ect Eb=N0 Receiver sensitivity Interference Receiver sensitivity Receiver sensitivity The rst step in performing the link budget is determining the required signal strength at the receiver input. This is referred to as receiver sensitivity As described previously, this is a function of the Modulation Technique and the desired BER As an example, PSK modulation requires Eb=N0= 9:5dBto achive a BER = 10\u00005. Then its sensitivity will be the internal noise plus 9.5 dB. Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 37/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to"}
