( 1 6) Inflation was completed and the shape of the inflated satellite was temporarily maintained by the small gas pressure created by sublimating solids (i.e., 9.1 kilograms (20 pounds) of anthraquinone and 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of benzoic acid) contained within the satellite. (2) These inflatants could produce a skin stress of about 1.03 X10 newton/meter 2 (150 psi) in Echo I and the pressurized life of the satellite was approximately 14 days. . Initial tracking of the satellite was greatly aided by two radio beacon transmitters attached to the sphere's external surface. Each of the two assemblies, located diametrically opposite on the equator of the satellite, include one transmitter, its associated antenna, a group of solar cells and one-half of the satellite's storage­ batteries. (16) Each of the continuous wave transmitters was designed to provide about 10. 5 milliwatts of power at a frequency of 107.94 MHz. Crystals were chosen to provide a frequency separation of 500 to 1000 Hz between the two transmitted signals. *The quarter-wave monopole antenna for each beacon transmitter was erected normal to the satellite surface. The radiation pattern provided was somewhat similar to that of a monopole antenna above an infinite plane. In Echo II, the basic type of gore construction developed in Echo I was re­ tained. (1) It was made up of 106 gores with each gore measuring 1.2 X65. 5 meters (4 x 215 feet).( 2 ) The gores were butt-jointed together, using 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) wide tapes made of the same material as the gores. The gores terminated at the polar areas of the sphere where 137-centimeter (54-inch) diameter pole caps were attached, using a 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) overlapping joint. The material used"}
