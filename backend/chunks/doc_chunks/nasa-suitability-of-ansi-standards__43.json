Also, because theACTS LBRsystem handles theuser data in64bit blocks, itwo1:id bevery unlikely that asingle bit would be misrouted. Therefore, BitMisdelivery Probability isnotincluded intheset ofACTS performance parameters. BitLoss Probability Again, once auser information bitenters thesystem ithasonly onepath tofollow. However, iftheuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe local earth station clock, ortheearth station clock isnotsynchronized with ACTS, a\"clock slip\" canoccur.Iftheread clock isslightly slower then the write clock, thebuffer will eventually fill andlose bits. Additionally, deep fades onthelink would cause large blocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost, thus contributing tothevalue ofthis parameter. Even though theprobability oflosing abitintheACTS LBRsystem islow, BitLoss Probabi].ity isincluded inthesetofsystem performance parameters. Coupled with theBitError Probability, theBitLoss Probability gives agood indication ofthe transmission link performance and thesystems immunity to fades. 521989010985-062 Extra BitProbability Like theBitMisdelivery Probability andBit loss Probability, theExtra BitFrobability isvery lowforconnection oriented systems.However, extra bits canbegenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheearth station's terrestrial interface elastic buffer read clock isslightly faster then thewrite clock, thebuffer will empty, causing data bits tobeclocked outtwice andcounted as extra bits. Even though the probability ofreceiving anextra bit intheACTS LBR system islow, the Extra Bit Probability isincluded inthe set ofsystem performance parameters. Block Transfer Time Block Transfer Time counting starts when the first bit ofauser ': information block crosses theoriginating user/system interface andends when ,._: thesameblock crosses thedestination user/'system interface. Block Transfer !i Time isoneofthe significant ACTS LBRperformance parameters andtherefore included inthesetofparameters. Block Error Probability Duetotheblock processing nature ofACTS, ifabiterror occurs, then by definition ablock error also occurs. Therefore, themeasurement ofBlock i Error Probability isalso included inthe ACTS LBR system performance parameters. Block Misdelivery Probability Themain causes forblock misdelivery intheACTS LBRsystem areerrors in thedestination address information orswitch control commands.These would be undetected errors inthedestination address field oftheoriginating station's inbound order wire orerrors inthecontrol"}
