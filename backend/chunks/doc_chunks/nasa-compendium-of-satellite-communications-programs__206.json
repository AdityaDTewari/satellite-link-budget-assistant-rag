Determine performance of solid state satellite repeaters operating at UHF. Study the effect of the space radiation environ­ ment on various experimental solar cells. Define the spectrum of electromagnetic energy at optical frequencies as reflected by the earth and viewed by a synchronous satellite. Measure temporal and spatial characteristics of near earth, space radiation. Evaluate the feasibility of autonomous onboard control employing either cold ammonia gas or pulsed plasma thrusters. Determine the feasibility of autonomous on board control employing either magnetic torquing 'or cold ammonia gas thrusters. Demonstrate the-feasibility of satellite trans­ mitters operating directly from a solar array primary power system. Study use of switching in conjunction with multi-element arrays as a means of realizing a despun antenna-on a spin stabilized satellite. *Program objectives are numbered and defined in Table 9-10. 9-39 The despun antenna, indicated in the table, was flown on LES-6 and consisted of an array of 8elements with each element. composed of a pair of collinear axial extended dipoles in combination with a pair of collinear axial slots Two elements were excited at a time and all combinations of successive elements were sequentially activated as the satellite rotated. Each combination was excited in either of two­ phase relationships to produce two beam positions per pair of elements and a total of 16 switched overlapping beams in the array. Post launch measurements of antenna gain indicated it was in the region of 8.5 to 9 dB, which agreed with pre­ launch measurements. Pattern ripple due to beam switching was +0.5 dB Two antenna-switching logic systems were included on LESt6 which could be operated independently or in a combined mode (21). As on LES-4, one system measured the direction to the earth at one point in the orbit and predicted the orbital"}
