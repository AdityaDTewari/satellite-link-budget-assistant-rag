Both ofthese areservices that optical fiber transmission systems would behard pressed toprovide economically. Additionally, satellite systems formobile :ommunication applications arebeing developed, aservice that fiber cannot provide. All ofthese services, however, arestill using thesatellite basically asasimple repeater. ! TheNASA ACTS program takes thesatellite be,_ond this simple repeater role byproviding anexperimental advanced communication satellite that will demonstrate improved repeater technology andonboard baseband switching for traffic routing andnetwork control. Thesatellite will operate intheKaband (17to31GHz) with small diameter spot beams andcross polarization _oreduce interchannel interference andtoiucrease frequency reuse. Theonboard switch will operate ineither amicrowave mode, switching atthe intermediate frequency (IF) like type Csatellites (INTELSAT VI), orinabaseband mode, operating asademand-assignment multiple-access (DAMA) _y_cem with digital signal regeneration and forward error control coding. Thus, therole ofthe communication satellite isevolving from one ofasimple point-to-point transmission link tothat ofanetwork switching center, further enhancing the communication satellite's ability to provide point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point network connectivity. Satellites, such asACTS, and inexpensive very-small-aperture terminals (VSAT) will enable communication satellites toprovide economical, thin-route, two-way communication services tosparsely populated andinaccessible areas. These satellite systems will also facilitate two-way mobile communication. Additionally, thesp satellites will fitvery naturally into data networks such asanISDN, where thesatellite itself becomes oneoftheISDN switching nodes. Satellites with onboard ISDN switching capability could beUsed toprovide private ISDN services for large corporations. They could interconnect geographically dispersed locations with high-volume 23B+D Primary Rate ISDN (1.544 Mb/n) ormultiple-megabit per second broadband ISDN circuits. These satellites could also support two-way, thin-route traffic with direct links of 1989010985-013 satellites could also support two-way, thin-route traffic with direct links of theBasic ISON interface (2B+D channels at144kb/s) tothecustomer premises equipment (CPE). Other satellite-based or satellite-augmented ISDN applications include small transportable terminals fortemporary network access and mobile ISDN connectivity. These ISDN-compatible satellites working in parallel with fiber trunks andterrestrial switches could also provide"}
