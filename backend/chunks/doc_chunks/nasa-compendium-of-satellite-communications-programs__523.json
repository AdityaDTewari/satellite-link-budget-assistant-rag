This allows a marked increase in capacity and flexibility compared with the 7 dBW of the Phase I satellite. The Phase II synchronous satellites will be maintained with ±3 of their designated orbital positions; however, they can be repositioned at least once during their operational life to any other equatorial point, at a rate of 150per day. Table 17-3 provides a summary of the major characteristics of the Phase II satellite. All active components within the transponder are redundant. The selection of the active components and NB antenna switching and steering is done by ground com­ mand. To achieve maximum in-orbit usage of the Phase II satellite, all onboard sys­ tems have been sized to provide a minimum 5-year operational lifetime. All transmitting antennas are left-hand and circularly polarized, whereas the receiving antennas are right-hand and circularly polarized. The two NB antennas are capable of being independently steered ±100 from each of two orthogonal directions, and the half-power beamwidth covers an area approximately 750 miles in diameter near the subsatellite point. The EC antennas (transmit and receive horns) provide coverage to approximately one-third of the earth's surface. Electrical power is sup­ plied to the satellite from solar arrays. In addition, batteries are provided for eclipse operation. 17-12 17.4 GROUND TERMINALS The two major groups of earth terminals to be employed in the Phase II DSCS include modified Phase I terminals and new terminals to be procured as a follow-on to the current developmental effort. The major characteristics of the Phase I earth ter­ minals are found in corresponding Paragraph 12.4. Modifications and additions being made to these terminals and the major charabteristics of the new terminals are sub­ sequently discussed. Table"}
