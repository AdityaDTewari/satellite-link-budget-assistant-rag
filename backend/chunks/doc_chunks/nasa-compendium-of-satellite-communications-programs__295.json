The transmitter itself is a 5-kw multlcavity klystron. The video bandwidth available for the television mode Is 5 MHz. For more efficient transmission of television and telephone signals, there are stand­ ard preselection systems. High transmitter carrier frequency stability is achieved by using a quartz master oscillator in the exciter with subsequent multiplication and mixing with the FM modulator signal. The receiving equipment consists of operating and monitoring receivers. Each consists of a remote parametric amplifier with IF preamplification, IF amplifiers, 11-15 0 Table 11-3.
