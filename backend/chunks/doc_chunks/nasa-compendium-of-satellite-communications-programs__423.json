S. For the tests,,the ATS ground station atRosman, N. C., or Mojave, California, will transmit frequency modulated (FM) TV signals accompanied by multiple audio channels to ATS-F for relay as UHF signals to apilot receiving unit lodated at Goddard. The pilot unit consists of a 3-meter (10-foot) diameter parabolic antenna coupled to a low-cost receiver. Objective performance measurements will be made on this unit using, internationally tecognized and accepted standards for TV transmis­ sions. Principal Investigator:: John E.
