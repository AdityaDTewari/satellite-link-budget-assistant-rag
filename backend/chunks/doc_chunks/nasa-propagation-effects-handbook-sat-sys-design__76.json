Thedistribution ofcross-polarization isolation, indecibels, turns outtobeapproximately Gaussian. Anassumption ofuniformrain rate restricts themodel toshortpaths, butanextension to themore general case ofvarying rain rate along thepath isinprogress. The general method should also beapplicable tosatellite paths. Experimental depolarization data onsatellite pathsappears tobe approximately normally distributed. Combining this with theobserved log-normal distribution ofrain attenuatioo, aprobabilistic model of depolarization incombination with attenuation hasbeen proposed (Wallace - 1981).Inthis model thejoint probability density ofXPD, indecibels, and thelogarithm ofrain attenuation, indecibels, isapproximated byabivariate Gaussian density. This description agrees fairly well with experimental results. Theproposed model hasbeen usedintheanalysis ofsingle-site and diversity system availability. 4.3.4 Experimental Depolarization Data Themost extensive experimental investigations ofdepolarization above 10GHztodate havebeen performed atVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI &SU)atBlacksburg (Bostian andDent -1979), the University ofTexas (UT) atAustin (Vogel -1978), _ndtheBell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) inHolmdel, andCrawford Hill, N.J. (Arnold, etal- 1979). Thesignal sources fordepolarization measurements conducted atthese facilities have been beacons onthefollowing spacecraft. 141 ATS-6 20GHz, 30GHz, LP CTS 11.7 GHz, RHCP COMSTAR 19.04 GHz, Vert. &Horiz. LP COMSTAR 28.56 GHz, Vert. LP Four COMSTAR spacecraft, D-1through D-4, have been used. Intheexperiments, thesignallevels inthecopolarized andcross polarized channels weremeasured, either continuously orduring periods of rain. Themeasurement records were typically used togenerate XPDandCPA statistics andplots ofXPDversus CPA.
