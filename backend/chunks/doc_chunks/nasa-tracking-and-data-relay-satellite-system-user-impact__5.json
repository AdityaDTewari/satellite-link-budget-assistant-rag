The intended scope of the study also originally included considerations of compatibility with the NASA network ground stations and significant effort on antenna configurations which reject or protect from earth generated radio frequency interference (RFI). Upon notification that the frequency bands of operation for the telecommunication links between the TDRS and the users had been changed from VHF/UHF to S-band, this contractor redirected the remaining effort to concentrate on S-band user antennas, specifically those for which reliable hardward implementation data was available. Accordingly, applicable experience from past and current commercial and military space programs has been utilized to arrive at a number of antennas which can be considered suitable candidates for user spacecraft missions. Notwithstanding the elimination of VHF and UHF for the links, the preliminary data gathered on antennas for these bands is nevertheless included in this report at the end of Section 4, User Antenna Study. 1-1 2. SUMMARY 2.1 General TDRSS Concept The TDRSS concept employs two synchronous altitude geostationary satellites deployed in order to provide telecommunication links between multiple earth-orbiting satellites and a centrally located ground station(i). The benefits of employing a data relay satellite system are: (1) Increased user real-time data capability (2) A possible reduction of user satellite on-board data storage (3) A possible reduction of the geographic extent and complexity of the NASA ground tracking and data network. Figure 2.1 shows the general configuration of the overall system. TDRS E is stationed above the Atlantic and TDRS W is above the Pacific Ocean. The communication links from the ground station to the user are defined as forward links, while the links from the user spacecraft to the ground station are defined as return links. Although the overall system concept embraces"}
