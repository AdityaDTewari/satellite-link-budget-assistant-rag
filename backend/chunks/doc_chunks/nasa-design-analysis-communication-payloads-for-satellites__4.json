However, once all of these components are picked, the important characteristics of each component are recorded usually into an Excel document to getan estimate of the mass, power, and cost requirements for the mission. These steps are used each time acommunication payload is designed, and going through them takes time. However, if all of the information is saved and easily accessible, the amount of time for this part of the design process can be greatly reduced. II. Design Philosophy The idea behind the two tools was to create interfaces which were user friendly for experts and newcomers tocommunicationpayloaddesign. Togetabetterideaoftheprogram’sappearance, VisualStudiowaschosento aid in creating and designing these tools. Visual Studio is an IDE for Visual Basic which allows the userto design the appearance of the program in situ. With it, common objects such as buttons, radio buttons, textboxes, and combo boxes can easily be moved, resized, and programmed for events. Visual Basic was chosen as the language to program in as it is relatively easy to learn, and versatile when compiled acrossMicrosoft products (as NASA most commonly utilizes). To choose the kind of databases to use for the RF Link Budget Calculator and Visual Communication Payload design tool, the portability of each program had to be considered. Excel spreadsheets were used inthe link budget tool to store the ground antenna information since it was much easier to update and movethe database from any computer. The MySQL database was used for the communication payload designsoftware, because it is open-source and can be installed on any computer. The database of all commercialpayload components contains pictures of each component, leading to a larger sized database, so an Excelspreadsheet database is not the best implementation for this program. Microsoft Access was also a strongconsideration as a database since NASA uses Microsoft products, but the"}
