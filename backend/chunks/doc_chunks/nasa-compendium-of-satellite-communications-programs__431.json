(42) The RFI measurements will be performed using standard noise-power-ratio (NPR) tests with the earth terminal configured in a back-to-back loop through the satellite. The reference NPR measurements will be made using the earth coverage (low gain) antenna of the satellite with the main beam of the high gain 9-meter (30-foot) antenna pointed to a quiet spot on the earth. In order to relate the inter­ ference levels to the wanted-to-unwanted, signal ratios (C/X), the -system carrier-to­ noise and baseband signal-to-noise ratios will also be measured. The main beam of the high gain antenna will then be pointed toward a high density population area such as the northeastern coastal region of the United States and the measurement technique repeated. This set of measurements now contains both the simulated desired signals (and basic noise) plus the real (unwanted) noise signals from all earth sources within the field of view of both satellite antennas. These unwanted noise signals, sharing the same common carrier frequency as the simulated system, can now be determined by remeasuring the system NPR, carrier-to-noise, and baseband signal-to-noise 13-118 ratios. The measurements will be repeated to determine the interference noise levels as a function of source latitude, frequency, and time.
