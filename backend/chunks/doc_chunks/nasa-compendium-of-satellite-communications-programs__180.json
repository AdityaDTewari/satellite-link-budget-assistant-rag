The use of cir­ cularly polarized antenna feeds made the terminal compatible with the circular polari­ zation employed by the X-band antennas on LES-1, -2, and -4. In addition to its signal processing, the LET system included another novel innovation. It incorporated a small general purpose digital computer (UNIVAC 1218) as an integral part of the cpmmunications terminal. The computer system was assigned four major tasks. It derived pointing angle inputs to the antenna servo system. This computation also produced range and Doppler estimates for use in time and frequency synchronization. The computer generated displays for terminal operators and provided flexible operating controls. Further, it handled vocoder and teletype message traffic multiplexing/demultiplexing. 9.2.5 Experiments Experiments conducted during the X-band portion of the LES program may be grouped into six major categories as indicated in Table 9-8() (4) (9). The automatic magnetic torquing experiment was a success on LES-2 where, after several months, the spin axis settled into an average 12' position away from perpendicular to the satellite-sun line. The spin axis oscillated ±70 about this position with a period of 135 days( 1). Automatic magnetic torquing of the spin axis could not be accomplished on LES-I and -4, however, due to the tumbling mode assumed and improper orbit respectively. The space radiation experiment was conducted on LES-4 exclusively. With the highly elliptical orbit attained, LES-4 supplied extensive data on the energy spectrum of trapped electrons in five energy ranges from 130 keV to 4 MeV and at altitudes from 185 to 33,706 kilometers (100to 18,200 nautical miles)( 1 ) . Five solid state detectors were employed. A sixth detector was"}
