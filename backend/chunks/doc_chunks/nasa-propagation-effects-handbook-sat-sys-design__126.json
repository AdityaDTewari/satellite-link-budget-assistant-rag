Thevalues forsalt-water droplets, corresponding toocean fogs and mists, arehigher byapproximately 25%at20°Cand5%atO°C(Koester and Kosowsky-1978). 6.4.2 Clouds 6.4.2.1 Water Content ofClouds. Theliquid water content ofclouds varies widely. Forstratiform, orlayered, clouds, thevalue wasobserved tomost often fall intherange of0.05 to0.25 g/m3.Forthemost dense ofthis type ofcloud, stratocumulus, maximum values from 0.3to1.3g/m3have been measured (Mason-1971). Cumulus clouds, especially thelarge cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus that accompany thunderstorms, have thehighest values of liquid water content. Fair weather cumulus were found tohave liquid water contents generally less than Ig/m3.Peak values exceeding 5g/m3were found incumulus congestus clouds byWeickmann andaufm Kampe (1953). They estimated anaverage value of2g/m3forcumulus congestus and2.5g/m3 forcumulonimbus.i,_L• i/ Clouds arenothomogeneous masses ofaircontaining evenly distributed droplets ofwater. Rather, theliquid water content canvary widely with location within asingle cloud. Ontheaverage, theliquid water content insmaller cumulus congestus clouds increases fairly steadily with distance upfrom thebase, then begins todrop offsomewhere inthe mid-to-upper parts. Italso generally decreases with horizontal distance from thecenter toward theedges. Small-scale variations arealso present, however. Sharp differences have been observed inlocalized regions onthe order of100macross.

Using theestimated average liquid water content from above (2g/m3),andtheattenuation coefficient fromFigure 6.4.1,this implies anadded path loss at35GHzof about 4to16dB.Fortunately,this calculation grossly overestimatesthe actualattenuation thathasbeenobservedthrough these clouds. This appears tobegenerallytrue, asseeninTables6.4-1and6.4-2,which present measurements from twosources. InTable 6.4-1, thegaseous attenuation, calculated forthemeasured surfacerelative humidity, isgiven forcomparison. Thecloud attenuation is inmost cases 40%orless ofthegaseous attenuation.
