TheLPphase difference atB =450isonly weakly dependentonXPD, sothe2Bterm predominates inac. Experimental datafrom theCPCTSbeacon at28.56 GHzgenerally confirmed thetheoretical expectations. Thephase difference oftheLPsignal normally remained ina20-300 range during arain depolarization event, whereas theCPsignal phase difference varied widely during thecourse ofa rain event. Thephase versus XPDchanges generally followed acharacteristic sequence during convective storms. This indicated thechanges inthenature ofthedepolarizing medium, primarily inpredominant canting angle ofthe raindrops present, through thepassage ofthestorm cell. 145 Theexperimental evidence suggests that crosstalk cancellation schemes would bemore effective using LPthan CPwaves. Thephase ofthe crosspolarized signal, which must beestimated bythecancellation system, is much less variable with linear polarization. Infact, setting thephase of thecancellation signal toaconstant value would give adegree of effectiveness, while eliminating theneed foracomplex phase shifter control system. 4.3.6 Rate ofChange ofDepolarization Tomore fully characterize depolarization, some quantitative description oftherate ofchange oftheamplitude andphase ofthe crosspolarized signal would bedesirable. This information would assist usin designing adaptive controls forcrosstalk cancellation systems, andmayalso provide further insight intothenature ofthemeteorological process responsible fordepolarization. However, there hasapparently been little research effort expended tothis end. Further experimental work, orfurther analysis ofexisting data bases, isneeded inthis area. 4.3.7 Rain Depolarization Dependence onElevation Angle andFrequency Knowledge ofthedependence ofcrosspolarization discrimination on elevation angle andfrequency isquite valuable because itallows ustoextend theusefulness oftime-consuming andcostly measurements. Unfortunately, the present limited body ofexperimental evidence does notoverwhelmingly support thetheoretical scaling relations, sothey must beused with caution.
