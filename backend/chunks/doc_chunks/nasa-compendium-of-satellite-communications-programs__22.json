The organizational grouping this provides may not in all cases coincide exactly with the chronological 1-1 sequence of events or the official program organization based on administrative con­ siderations and initially expected results. The document is organized and formatted to provide the user with easy access to needed information. It features a chronological ordering of program descriptions, brief concise summaries of each program, including extensive use of tabular presen­ tations, adherence to a consistent format from description to description, and exten­ sive bibliographies of cited and related references from which the reader can do more detailed research on a particular aspect of a program. The consistent format provides consideration of the same items of information in the same order on each program and extends this philosophy from the defining and ordering of major subtopics to the de­ fining and ordering of the tables employed. The bibliographies are incorporated directly following the particular program to which they are pertinent and are composed, in general, of references readily available within the public domain. The basic format for each description encompasses the following major sub­ topics: (1) Program Description, (2) System Description, (3) Spacecraft, (4) Ground Terminals, (5) Experiments, and (6) Operational Results. In a few instances, the nature and extent of available information dictated that the \"Program\" and \"System Description\" subtopics be replaced by a \"General Description\" or \"IAtroduction\" subtopic. In such cases, information of the type normally included in the first two subtopics is distributed over the introductory, spacecraft, and ground terminal sub­ topics. Information, \"typically, included within each major subtopic is as follows: * Program Description -Project origin and objectives; spacecraft launch dates, orbital data, and status; extent to which program objectives were accomplished;"}
