The entire ammonia fuel load was depleted on ATS-1 (probably by a leak at a pressure transducer port) and particle contamination resulted in abnormal valve operation and thrusting performance on ATS-3. (5) Considerable data was obtained on the navigation and satellite technology experiments with the result that all major objectives have for the most part been met.
