Operational Results These were not operational spacecraft; therefore, no operational traffic was carried. The experimental tactical ground, terminals operated' essentially as expected. One difficulty was that production models of the TATS modem displayed poor reliability. The satellites also operated, generally, as expected in spite of a number of minor difficulties, most of which were described, in the discussion of \"Experiments\" in Section 9.3. 5. Problems previously discussed' on,LES-5 included the sun sensor failure affecting the automatic attitude control system, the high rate timing signal to the RFI and command receiver, the 11-dB degradation in communications receiver- sensitivity, and the sudden shift in transponder frequency translation. Additional LES-5 9-47 difficulties included intermodulation between the telemetry and commuincations transmitters, an open circuit in one series-connected string on a solar panel, and higher than expected first year degradation of the solar array (i. e., about 22%), The intermodulation was a result of the two signals using the same antenna and was generated in spring finger contacts used at the.edges of the slot antenna cavities behind the solar panels. This -problem disappeared after the satellite had been in orbit a few months. The solar array.power difficulties did not interfere with LES-5 testing. Problems previously discussed on'LES-6 included spinning about an axis 2.20 offset from the axis of symmetry of the csrliiader, one solar panel delivering a low power output, a flip flop failure in an Earth Position register of the antenna switching logic, and interference to the radiation environment experiment by radiating communications antenna elements. Additional LES-6 difficulties included intermodu­ lation between the beacon and communications transmitters and the shutter, covering the radiation experiment, operating intermittently. The former was the same problem as experienced on LES-5 and it too disappeared after a.brief time of in-orbit opera­ tion. The latter"}
