It is necessary to maintain spacecraft posi­ tion and attitude by on-board control systems and to switch spare repeater subsys­ tems if malfunctions occur. The control is exercised at Oakhanger by the Telemetry and Command Station on the basis of computations performed at Royal Aitcraft Es­ tablishment, Farnborough. SKYNET I uses UHF unprotected commands. SKYNET II will use a crypto-protected command system compatible with the U. S. Air Force Space Ground Link System (SGLS). Engineering control of the communication system is exercised from the Master Engineering Control Center (MECC) collocated with the Type I"}
