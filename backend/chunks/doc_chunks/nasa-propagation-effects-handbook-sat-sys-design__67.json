Thepolarization mismatch factor forawave with agiven polarization stateincident onanantenna that ismatched totheorthogonalstateiszero. lib Itisalways possibletodecomposeawave into twocomponents with orthogonal polarization states. Ana_bitrary wave canbeconsidered asbeing composed ofacomponent with apolarization state matching theantenna, anda second component with theorthogonal state. Theantenna extracts maximum power from thematched component, butcompletely rejects theorthogonal component.
