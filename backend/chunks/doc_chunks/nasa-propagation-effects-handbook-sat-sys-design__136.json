Experimental measurements todate have shown no significant dependency ofdiversity gain onthelink frequency (Goldhirsh and Robison-1975) over the10-30 GHzfrequency. Certainly theprobability ofa given attenuation level being exceeded onasingle path isstronglyfrequency dependent. However, diversity gain isaconditional statistic based upon the difference between singleterminal anddiversity attenuation levels. However, forlinkfrequencies above 30GHz, attenuation onboth paths simultaneously duetouniformrain systems canbesufficient tocause asignificant attenuation. This results inanapparent frequency threshold tothediversity gain (Kaul-1980) andwill bediscussed below. 6.5.4.6Anisotropy ofRain Cells Alon9aFront. There isatendency for convective rain cells associated with frontal activity tooccur inbands nearlyperpendicular tothedirection ofmovement ofthefront. Thedirection ofmotion ofthecells within such aband tends tobealong orslightly ahead ofthedirection ofthefront, and, furthermore, themore intense cells tend toelongat eintheir direction ofmotion (Harrold andAustin-1974). Thus, two types ofanisotropy areevident. Thefirst isassociated with theelongation ofindividual cells andisrelated totheprobability ofparallel paths passing through thesamecells. Thesecond isassociated with thestatistics ofthevector separation between rain cells andisassociated with the probability ofparallel paths simultaneously intersecting twodifferent rain cells. Fortunately, these twopreferred orientations arenearly parallel, and thus thesame corrective action isrequired ineach case. Namely, the baseline orientation should benearly perpendicular tothese preferred directions. 6.5.4.7 Local Climatology. Toafirst orderofapproximation itiscommonly assumed that theprobabilities ofrain cell occurrence areuniformly distributedover rather large regions oftheearth's surface. This assumption maybeinvalidated bythepresence ofanyoneofthefollowing features: mountains, large valleys, large bodies ofwater, orurbanheat \"islands\". These features cangive rise tononuniform spatialdistributionsofrain cell probabilities. Spatial distributions ofrainfall accumulation arereadily available inthemeteorological literature; however, itisnotcurrently known whether 265 theuseofthese data isapplicable tothequestion ofearth terminal siting. Forexample, itmaybeargued that these rainfall accumulations aredominated bylowrainfall rates andthus donotreflect thespatial distributions of intense rain cells which dominate theoccurrence ofhigh attenuation levels on earth-space paths. 6.5.4.8Switching Rates. Therate ofchange ofattenuation onasingle path isrelatively slow. Thehighest rates reported areontheorder of0.1 dB/sec, at15GHz(Hodge-1974a, Strickland-1977) and2dB/sec, at11.7 GHz (Ippolito-1979).
