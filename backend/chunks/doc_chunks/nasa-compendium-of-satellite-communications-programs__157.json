Summary of Program Experiments Type Activity Nature of Activity 1. Synchronous Orbit Injection Demonstrate launch and synchronous orbit injection of spin stabilized satellite. 2. Stationkeeping and Attitude Demonstrate precision control of spin Control axis attitude and central longitude of earth subsatellite point. 3. Communications Demonstra- Display feasibility of synchronous satellite tions communications to live audiences. 4. Communications Perform- Measure overall communications per­ ance formance of synchronous satellite system. 5. Communications Technical Measure detailed link and communications Characteristics parameters in synchronous satellite system. Thousands of successful special tests and demonstrations were performed over the Syncom satellites. These include numerous demonstrations of teletype, telephony, and facsimile. Special demonstrations displayed vocoder operation, multiple access using spread spectrum, real time relaying of satellite telemetry, transmission of oceanographic data, continuous 24-hour auto-tracking, 28 hours of continuous com­ munications with the Kingsport while underway at sea, and direct teletype communica­ tions with an aircraft in flight. The latter employed the VHF command receiver and telemetry transmitter on Syncom 1i. (19) Special occurrences among the demonstrations included President J. F. Kennedy speaking from the White House to the Prime Minister of Nigeria; President Kennedy's address to the United Nations; conversations between participants in the 1963 Extraor­ dinary Administrative Radio Conference of the ITU in Geneva, Switzerland, and mem­ bers of the U.N. in New York; and international TV coverage of the Olympics from Japan in October, 1964. The demonstrations also displayed that satellite time delay and echo could be overcome. However, to accomplish the latter it was"}
