Individual terminal loop back tests plus half and full duplex two-terminal operations were conducted. Extensive multiple access tests were not performed due to the limited number of participating terminals having compatible modulation and signal processing systems. However, the LET ter­ minal approach to modulation made multiple access a real possibility even for operation with hard limiting satellites. Operating frequehcies for the X-band Lincoln Experimental Satellites are shown in Table 9-40 ). By choosing the X-band frequencies for communications experiments, it was possible to make use of ground terminal facilities previously developed for Project West Ford. More important, however, it afforded the opportunity in accordance with the program objectives, to conduct tests and develop experimental hardware operating at frequencies internationally allocated for military satellite communications. Table 9-4. X-Band LES Operating Frequencies (MHz) Communications -Telemetry* Up Link Downlink Beacon 8350 7750 7740 237 *VHF tracking was also performed on this signal. A command system was not employed. The two West Ford terminals used conventional FM for their RF modulation and frequency division multiple access when full duplex operations were conducted. Signal processing and link performance for LET operations with LES are summarized 9-7 in Table 9-5(7) (9) (10) The signal structure except for the frequency hopping feature is sketched in Figure 971 In the LET system, the elementary channel symbol used was a sinusoidal pulse 200 gs in duration on one of 16 frequencies. The received pulse was detected by a bank of 16 matched filters. This modulation-demodulation system was preceded by a con­ volutional encoder and followed by a sequential decoder. Information rates of approxi­ mately 200 bps, 5 kbps, and 10 kbps were achieved. At the 5-kbps rate, an information bit was fed to the encoder every"}
