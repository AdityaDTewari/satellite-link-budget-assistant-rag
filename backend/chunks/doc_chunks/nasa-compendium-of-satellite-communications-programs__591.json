Organization GSFC ARC, Carleton, Stanford COMSAT CTS Experiments (1 of 8) Country Objective U.S. To test operational hardware, link performance and link characteristics. Also to provide near real time characterization of EMP environment and long term variation to advance technology. U. S. To demonstrate the ability to expand instruction by sharing classes between universities and to optimize class presentations and interactive techniques to promote curriculum sharing. In addition the experiment will be used to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate cost effective video compression techniques in conjunction with effi­ cient channel coding and modulation. U. S. To demonstrate the feasibility of providing quick­ reaction emergency communications to areas iso­ lated by disaster or geographic conditions. CTS will be used to interconnect a base earth station with a remote highly portable terminal which has been dropped or transported to an area of simulated emergency. The link will be capable of providing two-way TV and/or voice.

Organization Lister Hill, HEW SALINET Federation of Rocky Mountain States Communications Research Centre Communications Research Centre CTS Experiments (2 of 8) Country Objective U.S. Promote wide dissemination of information between, research institutions and the medical community; evaluate broad band teleebnfer­ ence to support continuing education among health care profession:als. U. S. To demonstrate the feasibility of extending li­ brary services to rurally isolated communities. Included would be. an extension of library services to local officials, small businessmen, and para­ professionals; as well. as the maintenance of a regional bibliographic data bank. U.S."}
