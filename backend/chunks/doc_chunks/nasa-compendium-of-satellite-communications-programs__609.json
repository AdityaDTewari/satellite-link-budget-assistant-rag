A diagram of the Satcom as stowed on the Delta 3914 is given in Figure 20-14. A summary of the Satcom general characteristics as well as its communications and TT&C subsystems is presented in Table 20-4; The novel features are (1) the three axis stabilization system which uses magnetic torques as well as a momentum wheel and jets and (2) the antenna which consists of four gridded rectangular reflectors with some overlap to allow for greater effective aperture within the 3914 envelope constraint. The overlap is possible since a horizontally gridded reflector is transparent to vertical po­ larization. The Satcom support subsystem characteristics in Table 20-5 and the weight and power summary of Table 20-6 provide more detail on the satellite. The Satcom satellite communications subsystem is described in more detail by the antenna beam coverage diagram in Figure 20-12, the block diagram of Figure 20-15, and the beam assignments in Table 20-7. 20.4.4 The RCA Ground Terminals The earth segment of the RCA Domsat system is operational in part and is being used in conjunction with leased channels first on the Canadian Telesat (Anik) satellites and presently on the Western Union Westar satellites. There are several kinds of ter­ ninals in the earth segment. These terminals and their characteristics are listed in Table 20-8 facilitating comparision between the CONUS, Alaska, and bush terminals which were planned; and the large Talkeetna terminal which was purchased from Comsat; and the transportable terminals which were already available. A notable feature of certain earth terminal electronics is the single (voice) channel per carrier (SCPC) equipment which results in great operational flexibility for small users. A summary of the antenna characteristics and capabilities is given in Table 20-9 which applies to both the RCA 10-m (32-ft.) and 11-m"}
