Link margin M 8.0 dB Table 1: Example Link Budget showing Receive Antenna Gain Transmitter loss is treated separately since it a ects the EIRP directly. The system temperature was obtained known that the antenna temperature was 300 K, the receiver equivalent temperature was 3806 K, and the noise gure of the receiver was 11.5 dB. Hence, the system temperature is 4106 K or 36.1 dB-K. In Table 1, the budgeting is similar to have we have handled link budgets in the past: receive antenna gain is accounted for directly and the signal-to-noise ratio calculated directly by computing the noise power kT. Hence, to calculate the received Wr=N0ratio, you simply divide the received isotropic power by kTor subtract 192:5dBW/Hz in the budget. You can also compute the"}
