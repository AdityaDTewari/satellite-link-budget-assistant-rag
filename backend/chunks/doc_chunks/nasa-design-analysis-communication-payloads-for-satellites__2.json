Command Line Link Budget Program Even more, a satellite communications toolbox has been created by Mathworks to also help calculate basic characteristics for a satellite link. It allows a user to use predeﬁned functional blocks to create graphsfor carrier to noise power. However, using this toolbox involves substantial monetary purchase of MATLABsoftware and time to become acquainted with the MATLAB software and programming language. A link budget is a ﬁrst step for communications payload designers and potential users to determine if a wireless transmitter and receiver can “close” a link, meaning if a wireless signal has enough powerat the receiving end such that its information is retained and readable. 5The link budget is a way for designers and users to obtain a prelimary understanding of the dynamics which will be involved in draftingthe communications systems of a mission. Naively, one could say a link budget equation appears: Received Power =Transmitted Power +Gains+Received Area −Losses (1) Eq. (1) is a simplistic way of showing the idea behind calculating a link budget. Received and Transmitted Power is measured in dBW, while Gains, Received Area, and Losses are measured in dB. This equation becomes far more complex when one considers how to calculate each term. For example, how one determines the gain of DSS 27 based on its inclination, frequency, and surrounding wind froma cursory reading of the DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook easily demonstrates this. 3So, the diﬃculty/complexity in these calculations is the primary motivation for the creation of a user-friendlyprogram which aides in link budget calculation.
