They also define the signal method, do error correction using redundancy coding, do time and frequency multiplexing, and perform link monitoring. Satellite links are often asymmetric, having the ability to receive more dzta than they can send. 5. Tracking gears: Gears move the antenna, if needed. 6. A mtc~owove ~cnsporcnt bt;i!dirzg (radome): A radome is required if the reflectm, feed and outdoor equipment requires covering from wind and snow. 7. The terrestrial interconnect: This could be a router, or a video codex or a multiplexer to combine several input streams. In order for an Earth station to become operational it must go through a series of tests and adjustments. The tests are designed to test whether proper frequencies and time slots (for TDM access) are used. Measurements are made and documented to insure that the power levels are correct. The power is measured in terms of Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRE’). The units are decibels (dBW). Too much power can cause the signal to be distorted and could disrupt other communications. Under-powered transmission can be error prone. The noise level in both directions is measured. This is G/T (the ratio of the gain fi-om the antenna and outdoor equipment to the signal noise). The higher the ratio the better. The definitive test is of course the actual error statistics measured by sending test data in both db3CtiOES. 5. COMMUNICATIONS ONBOARD A SATELLITE Earth orbiting satellites are a wonder of modern technology. Everything must withstand the rigors of space in addition to the strain of the launch. In space there are extreme cold and heat, radiation and micrometeorites, and storms on the Sun. Orbits must be"}
