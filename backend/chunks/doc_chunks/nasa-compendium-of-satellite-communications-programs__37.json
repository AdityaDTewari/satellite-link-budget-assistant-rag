This completed 1-14 the early experimental phase of satellite communications wherein the fundamental system concepts that have continued to apply were established. Syncom demonstrated launch vehicle and satellite positioning and stabilization technologies to precisely inject spacecraft into synchronous equatorial orbits, to position in longitude and to maintain a satellite's longitudinal position (i. e., station­ keep). It further gave a preliminary indication that the long propagation time delay (i. e., 260 ms round trip) and the associated echo problems that it introduces into 2-wire terrestrial telephone facilities were surmountable and, therefore, posed no drawbacks to this approach to satellite communications. With synchronous technology proven, the facts that only three or four satellites were required to provide a system giving world­ wide earth coverage between +750 of latitude, that earth terminal tracking requirements were significantly relaxed though not entirely eliminated, and that the problem of hand­ over from one moving satellite to another no longer existed, made geostationary orbits the preferred choice for point-to-point communication via satellite. Syncom further refined the state-of-the-art by providing advancements in satel­ lite stabilization techniques and antennas. Syncom was spin-stabilized, as were Telstar and Relay, but in this case the spin axis was aligned at a 90 ° angle to the orbital plane and precisely maintained in this orientation by H202 gas jets. This\" allowed antennas providing pancake-shaped beams only slightly wider than required to cover the earth from synchronous altitude (i. e., 170) to be employed. These antennas provided gains of about 6 dB. With the feasibility of satellite communications demonstrated and the basic system concepts defined, interest turned in the mid-1960s to implementing operational systems, further refinements of spacecraft and"}
