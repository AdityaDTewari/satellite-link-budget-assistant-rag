(3) The satellite was in view of the ground station during each orbit for a maximum of 19 minutes at Fort Monmouth and 22 minutes at Puerto Rico. (2) Mutual visibilities as long as 15 minutes were available. 4-2 Operating frequencies for the Courier satellites were as indicated in Table 4-3. (2) The UHF communications frequencies were chosen for the wide band­ width and simplicity of equipment design provided in addition to the noise and propagation advantages at these frequencies; (4) Table 4-3. Courier Frequencies (MHz) Communications TT&C Uplink Downlink Command Telemetry 1750 1800 to 1900\" 135 108\"* * Two transmitters, modulated with same information and operating about 20 MHz apart, utilized for frequency diversity. ** Separate acquisition beacon, disabled upon satellite \"turn on,\" operated at same frequency. The basic signal processing techniques utilized on Project Courier were as indicated in Table 4-4. (2) (5) The modulated uplink, signal was detected in the satellite. The detected baseband.was recorded.in the satellite or retransmitted in real time. During transmission over the downlink, the detected signal modulated the satellite transmitter's radiated carrier. .The uplink performance was, in general, superior to the downlink performance indicated in the table. Margins had to be adequate to account for variations in range, rain losses, satellite antenna gain as the aspect angle to the ground terminal changed, and other link parameters that varied to a smaller extent. 4-3 Table 4-4.
