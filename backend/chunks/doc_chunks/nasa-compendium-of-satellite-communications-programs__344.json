The phased array antenna, employed on ATS-1, consisted of 16 antennas arranged around a circle of one wavelength radius with each antenna composed of four collinear dipoles. Phasing of the radiated output was accomplished using eight ferrite phase shifters. Each phase shifter provided two equal amplitude out­ puts whose phase was varied in an opposite sense by inputs from the Phased Antenna Control Electronics, PACE. The two phase shifter outputs were connected to two diametrically opposite antennas. The PACE derived phase shifter control signals from satellite spin rate inputs and orbital position. This antenna system realized a measured in-orbit gain of about 12, 5 dB with a beamwidth of approximately 220 due to the array. Beamwidth due to the stack of dipoles was determined, prior to launch, to be about 17% The PACE system demonstrated reliable performance and accurate pointing of the radiated beam. The total drive power requirement of the phase shifters was about 2 watts. The mechanically despun antenna, employed on ATS-3, consisted of a rotating cylindrical parabolic collimator illuminated by a two element collinear array feed. Each array element was a full wave dipole. The parabolic collimator was rotated in opposition to the direction of spacecraft spin by a 128-step synchronous stepping motorand encoder controlled by the Mechanical Antenna Control Electronics, MACE. The MACE system was essentially identical tO the, PACE system employed on ATS-1. The measured in-orbit gain of this antenna"}
