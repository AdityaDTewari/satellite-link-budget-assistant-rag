Pattern ripple due to beam switching was +0.5 dB Two antenna-switching logic systems were included on LESt6 which could be operated independently or in a combined mode (21). As on LES-4, one system measured the direction to the earth at one point in the orbit and predicted the orbital position of the satellite as a function of time while the second system determined earth direction during every revolution of the spinning satellite. In the bombined mode, the earth direction measuring system was employed during the hours of local daylight at the subsatellite point and the orbit storage system was used during the hours of local darkness. All modes of operation worked well- for the first week in orbit (2 9 ) . Subsequently a relay flip-flop failed in the Earth Position register of the orbit storage system causing inaccurate pointing in both that mode and the mixed mode. The earth direction measuring system continued to work as expected. As on LES-4, however, pointing became inaccurate between local sunset and sunrise as the satellite's optical sensors lost track of the exact location of the earth. Proper operation of LES-6's high efficiency RF transmitter from a varying dc power source was verified immediately after launch when it was discovered that one solar panel was not delivering the expected power. This failure produced a spin variation of about 1 volt in the solar bus voltage which resulted in about a 0. 5­ 2 9 ) dB spin variation in transmitted power . This variation was superimposed on the ripple due to beam switching. The transmitter has continued to perform properly as solar array output has varied with the season of the year and satellite lifetime in orbit. 9-40 Automatic attitude control systems were included on both LE S-5 and LES-6.
