The millimeter wave frequencies evaluated were at 15.3 and 31. 65 GHz. Finally, in early 1971, Intelsat successfully launched the first of a fourth genera­ tion Intelsat space system. This satellite features earth coverage and fixed narrow coverage antennas on a mechanically despun platform. Additionally, it provides 12 transponders of moderate bandwidth such that separate types of services can be pro­ vided in separate channels (e. g., television distribution in one channel, high capacity telephone trunks in another, and low duty cycle individual voice links in still another). Through the introduction of new technology in RF filters, TWTs, and antennas the Intelsat IVA will be able to provide 20 transponders by reusing frequency spectrum in different areas of the coverage zone. Thus, higher capacity will be accomplished without the extension of technology required to develop the Intelsat V satellite. In 1973, Telesat became operational, providing Canada with a commercial do­ mestic satellite communications system capable of providing communications to small, simple unattended terminals in far northern and arctic .remote locations. In addition to serving Canada's long haul and remote-location communications needs, Telesat is also providing the satellike link for the initial RCA Globcom U. S. domestic communi­ cations satellite system. Both strategic and tactical military communications progressed with the intro­ duction of operational DSCS Phase I satellites in March 1974. In addition to providing multiple high capacity links between strategic earth terminals with large antennas and high-powered transmitters, these satellites provide similar communication capabilities between mobile or transportable tactical earth terminals with small antennas and low­ powered transmitters. Just as significantly, the DSCS Phase II satellites provide the high capacity entry of the smaller tactical terminals into"}
