It was hypothesized from ground testing on similar hardware that a capacitor in the LO experienced an abrupt change in value. LES-6 has performed almost exactly as predicted throughout its lifetime except for the output variations due to the spin modulation on the dc power supply. None of the difficulties reviewed significantly handicapped the communications test program. Results of UHF noise and interference measurements are given in Table 59-18( . As indicated by the table, receiver composite noise temperature measurements were taken on vehicular, shipborne, and airborne terminals while uplink UHF interference levels at a synchronous satellite were measured on LES-5 and LES­ 6. LES-5's RFI receiver experienced a timing problem which was hypothesized to be due to cross coupling from one of the onboard logic systems that operated on earth­ sun inputs. These inputs disappeared around local midnight at the subsatellite point as did the RFI receiver timing problem. As a result, all of the LES-5 RFI data was centered about local midnight. LES-6's data gave a 24-hour distribution of interference but since the satellite was stationary the information obtained was primarily applicable to the North and Sduth American continents alone. In addition to the measurements indicated in Table 9-18, tests of interference generated by the UHF tactical satellite communications terminals were conducted showing that potential conflicts do exist if adequate distances and frequency separations are not maintained. Propagation link losses experienced by a UHF tactical satellite communications system as determined from experiments on LES-3, -5, -6 are summarized in Table 9-19 (see References 33 through 35 and 49). In addition to the factors indicated in the table, structural blockage during maneuvers was found to be an occasional problem in aircraft and shipboard terminals. Performance of the three major types of modems evaluated in"}
