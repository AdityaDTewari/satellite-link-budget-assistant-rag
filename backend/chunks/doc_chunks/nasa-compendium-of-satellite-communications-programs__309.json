The SCCF is the focal point of the control subsystem, and is collocated with the DCA Operations Center (DCAOC) in Arlington, Virginia. The primary mission of the SCCF is'to prepare and distribute long term (60 days prepared every 30 days), short term (up to 30 days duration), and emergency satellite/terminal schedules in accordance with validated user requirements. To establish communications between two terminals, it is necessary that a satellite be mutually visible to the terminals. The SCCF is able to provide satellite scheduling data for all links for a 60-day interval. Satellite visibility prediction based on probabilistic analysis for various links is shown in Figure 12-2 as a function of the total number of orbiting satellites: The visibility for the Hawaii-Republic of Viet Nam links is shown both for at least one satellite and for at least two satellites. Two satellites would be required when the channel requirements exceed the capability of one satellite. Thus, with a system composed of 15 satellites, the probability of at least one satellite being visible for the Hawaii-RVN link is 89 percent and that of a second satelite for a second link is 64 percent. Since there is no orbital control to permit repositioning of the satellites, random gaps can occur for the orbital plane. In addition, satellites may become temporarily unusable due to conjunctions with, other satellites or with the sun or moon. Also, since the satellites have no batteries, they do not operate during eclipse (while in the-earth's shadow). The satellite frequency plan is contained in Table 12-4. The assignment of the channel (frequency) is a functional responsibility of the SCCF. 12.3 SPACECRAFT As discussed in Section.12. 1, the DSCS Phase I space subsystem consisted of 26 satellites. In addition, an unsuccessful launch"}
