Finally, the communi­ cations experiments verified the link propagation parameters and provided the first indication that round'trip time delay and return echo due to two-wire user terminations are not insurmountable obstacles to the use of synchronous satellites in commercial communications applications. 8.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Initial tests performed while Syncom II was stationed over Brazil involved the Fort Dix, Camp Roberts, Lakehurst, and Kingsport terminals. After the satellite was repositioned over the Indian Ocean, tests were conducted employing principally the Asmara, Philippines, and Thailand terminals. Tests involving Syncom III included the Camp Roberts, Hawaii, Viet Nam, Kingsport, USS Canberra, USS Midway, Kashima, and Point Mugu terminals, among others. Practically all transmissions over either satellite were conducted on a loop-back basis or over a single link between two terminals. Both half and full duplex links were established. Typical earth coverages supplied by the synchronous orbits of Syncoms 11 and III are illustrated in Figure 8-1. (9) The significantly smaller area of 24-hour earth 8-4 coverage provided by Syncom II is due to its inclined orbit resulting in a daily figure eight earth trace of the subsatellite point.

Syncom Earth Coverage Operating frequencies for the Syncom satellites were as indicated in Table 8-3. (5) The communications frequencies were selected to be compatible with the ground complexunder development at that time for the Army's Project Advent. (7) Upon termination of this synchronous satellite project, the Fort Dix, Camp Roberts, and Kingsport terminals required only relatively minor modifications to become part of the Syncom program.
