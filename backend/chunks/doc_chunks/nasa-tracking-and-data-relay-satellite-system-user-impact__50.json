Comparison of Antenna Sizes 4-68 Figure 4.42 shows the results of the weight vs. gain comparison. In addition to the four antennas mentioned above, the data collected for two specific Hughes biconical horns 'are also plotted in the figure. It should be pointed out.that there are several inherent limitations in the practicability of this kind of weight versus gain comparison. The data plotted are only for the antenna elements themselves and exclude such items as diplexers, antenna control electronics, gimbals, supporting structures, rotary joints, etc. This exclusion compensates in part for the fact that on a weight basis, directional antenna systems for spin- stabilized satellites suffer unfairly because of the requirement for despinning in comparison with antennas.for 3-axis stabilized satellites. Alternatively, one could postulate a correction factor to even out this comparison. However, a single correction factor for spinners does not appear to be feasible. It is further noted that in general electronically scanned antennas are desirable where mechanical motion of the antennas cannot be tolerated or the rapidity of the required beam steering exceeds the capabilities of mechanical mechanisms. For the user spacecraft and the TDRSS geometry under consideration, neither of the requirements for mechanical motion or rapidity-of beam steering apply. Thus, based on this consideration alone, only mechanically steered or switched, or fixed antennas should be considered for application by the users. It is for the above mentioned reasons that the weight versus gain comparison given here should be used only-as a rough guide to give insight into the choice of user antenna selection, and not for the selection itself based on minimum weight. 4-69 A Electronically despun array of linearly polarize d ---- ...cavity backed slots"}
