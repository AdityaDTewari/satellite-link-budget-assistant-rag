Ageneral method oftranslating overall performance objectivesinto individual linkobjectives does notexist atthis timeforsatellite systems operating above 10GHz. Techniques have been developed forline-of-sight systems (Parker-1977 andGTE-1972), andsatellite systems atlower frequencies 372 Q,(CSC-1971),butthese have limited application inthepresent case. We present here some design tools that have been used inmillimeter-wave system design. They include rules-of-thumb andsimplifications that often apply, and more detailed procedures useful when thesimplifying assumptions cannot be made. Atthis point inthedesignprocedure wehave twofunctionally related parameters: arequired composite C/Nvalue, andthepercentage of time forwhich this C/Napplies. There maybeseveralpoints ofthis function (the cumulative probability distribution function ofC/N) specified. Atsome smallpercentage oftime, thesystem isconsidered tobeunavailable. Atsome larger percentage oftime, aform of\"degraded\" operationmight bedefined, corresponding toahigher C/Nvalue than theoutageC/N. Thepresent problem isoneofassigning toeach linkofthesystem values ofC/Nandcorresponding time percentages forwhich thevalues must beexceeded. Practically, this usually reduces toallocating outagetime oravailabilities among thelinks comprising thesystem,andallocating C/Nvalues tothelinks inawaythat is both compatible with thelinkoutagetime allocation, andachieves the required overall system performance. 7.3.5.1 Suballocation ofOutages andSignal toNoise Ratio. Oneimportant element inthis phase isthesub-allocation ofoutages. Wehave a specificationonthepermitted outage time foraserviceorcircuit, which comprises 2,4,orperhaps more links. Itisclear that ingeneral IOutage Ij°intly \\total =_\"_link outages +determined) outages / Thedefinitions oflinkoutagesareusuallyobviousoncethesystem archi- tecture hasbeen defined. Ifthepermitted total outage time issmall (<1%), thejointly determined outagesareextremely small andcanbeignored. For example, if(S/N)composit e<10dBisanoutage, then forabent pipe repeater either (S/N)up <10dBor(S/N)down <10dBwould constitute link outage events. Now, avariety ofcombinations (e.g., (S/N)up =13dBand (S/N)down <13dB)canalso result inanoutage condition. However, 373 assuming uncorreiated statistics andasmall percentage oftimecriterion, these joint contributions canbeignored with only slight error, since they arevery small. Therefore"}
