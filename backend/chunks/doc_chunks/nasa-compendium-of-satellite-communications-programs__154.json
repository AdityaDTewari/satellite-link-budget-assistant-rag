The transponder containing two 0.5-MHz bandwidth IF sections was replaced by a 10-MHz bandwidth channel for television tests with a 50-kHz option for small station testing. 8.4 GROUND TERMINALS Among the participating earth terminals listed in Table 8-2, the AN/FSC-9, the AN/MSC-44, and the Kingsport terminals were the principal stations involved in the"}
