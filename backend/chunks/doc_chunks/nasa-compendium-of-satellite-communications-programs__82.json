Jakes of Bell Telephone Laboratories and Mr. P. Tardani of Jet Propulsion Labs also on August 13, 1960. Finally, Echo I provided a first in international communications, when Russia agreed to participate in a cooperative experiment with NASA and to supply NASA with tracking data during the early orbits after launch. (11)(32)(33) The tests were con­ ducted in accordance with the Bilateral Space Agreement between the USSR (Academy of Sciences) and the USA (NASA) reached at Geneva on June 8, 19622 The tracking data consisted of photographs and optical observations that helped to determine that the balloon had been successfully deployed and to establish initial orbital parameters. 3-19 The communications experiments were performed between the Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory of the-University of Manchester, England, operating on .NASA's behalf and the Zimenki'Observatory of the Gorki State University.northeast of Moscow. The Jodrell Bank facility provided a 76. 2-meter -(250-foot) diameter steerable antenna and a 1-kW transmitter to radiate signals at a frequency of 164.2 MHz. The Zimenki facility received both this signal and the 136-MHz satellite beacon, using a 14.9-meter (49-foot) diameter antenna. Transmissions included unmodulated carrier, 400-Hz tone modulation, Mbrse telegraphy, teletype, telephone and facsimile. Theoretical link calculations showed that performance could only be marginal, but the results obtained were even poorer than expected. This was attributed to inaccurate pointing of the antenna at the'transmitting site, refractive and reflective effects on the signal at the low elevation angles and wide beamwidths used, and polarization mismatches between the transmitting and receiving antennas. In spite of this, 34 experiments were conducted between 21 February and 8 March 1964, and the international cooperation displayed made the entire operation a significant diplomatic success. 3.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Project Echo was an experimental program; therefore no operational traffic was carried.
