After about 12 7-11 months operation the problem seemed to disappear, perhaps due to the evaporation of the condensation into the vacuum of space. In addition, spurious responses by the spacecraft were observed rather frequently by noting the satellite equipment being turned on and off in the absence of ground commands. 7-12 APPENDIX 7-A. THE RELAY MICROWAVE ANTENNA The microwave antenna requirement for the Relay spacecraft included: 1. Omnidirectional pattern about the spin-axis 2. Coverage from near 350 to 1200 in zenith angle as measured from the spin axis 3. Circular Polarization 4. Sufficient decoupling between the two Relay transmitters to prevent the inactive one from loading the active one 5. Sufficient decoupling between transmitters and receiver. These requirements were met in a unique slotted waveguide antenna designed by 0. M. Woodward of RCA. The transmitting portion of the antenna was comprised of five parts: the mode transducer, the coaxial wavequide transmission line, the quarter­ wave plate, the inclined-slot exciters, and the radial waveguide. The mode transducer consists of two de-coupled input ports near the base of the antenna. With this the input coaxial TEM mode line can feed the coaxial TE 1-mode waveguide transmission line. The two input ports were oriented at right angles so that the TE modes excited in the coaxial waveguide would be orthogonal. In addition, the transmitter ports were one guide wavelength apart to reduce direct cross-coupling between them. To provide still further isolation, a quarter-wave plate consisting of two longitudinal metal ridges attached on opposite sides of the coaxial waveguide inner conductor was employed to convert the linearly polarized waves from the separate input ports to circularly polarized waves of opposite rotational sense. The radiator itself consisted of eight slots inclined at an angle of 55' and equally spaced about"}
