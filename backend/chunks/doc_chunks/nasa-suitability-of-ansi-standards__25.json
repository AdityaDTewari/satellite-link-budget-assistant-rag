User access tothe preassigned TDMA, SS/TDMA, and DAMA systems that switch between preassigned BTPs toaccommodate traffic changes isaccomplished byprior 281989010985-038 scheduling with theTDMA control center. This canrange from acouple ofhours tomonths ahead ofwhen the circuit isneeded (Trusty etal., 1986). User access toDAMA systems that generate new BTPs inreal time takes afew milliseconds toafewminutes. Therefore, theapplication ofthefour access parameters islimited totheDAMA systelns generating BTPchanges inreal time. Access Time Access Time forDAMA systems isthetime from user issuance ofacircuit request tothestartoftheuser's data transmission. Thetime synchronizing theuser's earth station tothenetwork isnot included intheAccess Time parameter asthis isnotrequired each time anew circuit isestablished. Access Time isone ofthe most significantparameters for quantifying DAMA system performance. Incorrect Access Probability Incorrect _ccess Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability of establishing a_zircuit with thewrong destination. Transmission errors during thecircuit request orgeneration and distribution ofthenew BTPs are the mechanisms for establishing anincorrect connection. However, inproperly designed DAMA networks, these errors arekept lowbytheuseoferror detection andcorrection techniques. Additionally, ifanerrored BTPisimplemented, the network will lose synchronization and\"crash\" before theincorrect connection wasmade. Therefore, duetoitslowprobability ofoccurrence, theIncorrect Access Probability parameter isnot included inthe set ofDAMA system performance parameters. Access Denial Probability Access Denial Probability for DAMA systems isthe probability ofnot establi&hing acircuit tothedesired destination. Theprimary cause ofaccess denial islack ofsystem capacity toaccommodate anadditional circuit. It also occur_ ifthesystem isslow inresponding totheaccess request orslow insetting upthecircuit, thus exceeding theaccess denial threshold. Again this would bedue tothesystem operating atornear capacity and thus not having sufficient processor capacity tohandl.e theadditional circuit request.
