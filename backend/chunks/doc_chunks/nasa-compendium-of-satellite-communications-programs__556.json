Another application of this technique provides 240 two­ way circuits between Allan Park and Harrietsfield. In addition, Telesat will be imple­ menting time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques in the near future, which will significantly increase message capacity. Another RF channel is used in a multiple access mode for Thin Route service, however, in this case, each RF carrier is mod­ ulated by a single voice circuit using phase shift keying with delta modulation and in this type of service, up to 120 one-way circuits can be provided between earth stations with a G/T of about 20 d13. Technical characteristics of the antenna, the receive and transmit assemblies, and the overall performance of these types of earth stations and the control subsystem Tracking Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) stations are summarized in Table 18-7. 18.4. 1 The Allan Park and Lake Cowichan Stations The Allan Park Station, which is the primary station in the entire Telesat network, contains three separate antennas and a large central building to house the necessary support facilities. The communications system, is a multi-purpose communications facility providing television and message services. It also provides a beacon signal and carries all TT&C functions for the satellites. The Lake Cowichan Station has basically the same communications aspects as the Allan Park Station except that its role in TT&C is only that of providing ranging and acting as a backup for other TT&C functions for the satellites. 18-23 Table 18-7.
