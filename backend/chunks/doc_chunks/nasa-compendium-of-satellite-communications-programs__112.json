The spattering function of a dispersive channel, together with the spectrum of the additive noise component, constitutes a model of the channel that is sufficiently detailed to allow synthesis of optimum signals and detect­ ions and to permit comparative performance of signaling schemes. The multipath and doppler spreads and path losses as measured by these techniques are summarized in Table 5-3.. The strongest overall conclusion of the propagation experiment is that the scattering function is generally well-behaved. Table 5-3.

Thus, the purposes of the communications experiment were the 1[rai6mission of digital data, the measurement of the performance of the system, 1hd'the-comparison of these results with theory. The'bask communications technique employed was binary frequency shift keying (FSK) with quadrature, full-wave, square­ law detection as indicated in Paragraph 5.2. In order to cope with intersymbol inter­ ference due to the dispersive nature of the channel, successive transmissions used different frequency pairs and were detected in separate receivers operating in parallel. Two message sources were available to the transniitter: a fixed word repetition and a standard 60-wpm"}
