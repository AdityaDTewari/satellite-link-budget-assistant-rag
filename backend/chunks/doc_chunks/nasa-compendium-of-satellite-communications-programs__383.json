No other spacecraft similar to the ATS-6 has ever been placed in orbit. This 1,402 kilograms (3,090 pounds) spacecraft consists essentially of an Earth Viewing Module (EVM) connected to a deployable reflector antenna which measures 9 meters (30 feet) in diameter when deployed. Spacecraft control, communications and experi­ ment systems are located in the EVM. For its first year of operation, the ATS-6 will be located at 94 degrees west longitude over the equator. At this location, a point over the Galapagos Islands, the spacecraft will be in view of all of the continental U. S. from its geosynchronous altitude of some 35,888 kilometers (22,300 miles). Shortly after the spacecraft is on this station and checked out, it will be used along with the ATS-1 and ATS-3 now in orbit to conduct the Health-Education Tele­ communications (HET) experiment which encompasses both educational and two-way medical tele-conferencing experiments. The HET experiments are planned in three geographic areas: the Rocky Moun­ tain region, the Appalachian states, and the states of Washington and Alaska. HET will pioneer delivery of high quality educational and health services to millions of Americans in remote parts of these areas. For the HET experiment, the ATS-6 will be able to relay two separate color TV signals, each accompanied by four voice channels. Thus, programs can be broadcast in several languages simultaneously with the viewer being able to select English, Spanish, or one of several American Indian dialects. The ATS-1 and ATS-3 space­ craft will be used for two-way voice and data transmissions in support of the ATS-6 during both educational and health-medical experiments. Approximately one year after launch, the ATS-6 will be moved eastward to 350 east longitude which is over the eastern edge of Lake Victoria, located in Kenya, East"}
