These areprimarily using thesatellite asatrunk between ISDN switches oraswitch and the local user/network interface. For the broad bandwidth interswitch trunks, simple type Aandtype Bcommunication satellites, orany oftheTDMA systems areusable. Fortherelatively lowbandwidth links between ISDN switches anduser/network interfaces, narrow-band TDMA systems using only apart ofatransponder (Pritchard andSciulli, 1986) andvery-small-aperture terminals (VSATs) areappropriate. The next step isfor the satellite itself tobecome anISDN switch. Advanced satellites, like NASA's ACTS with onboard switching, (see Section 4) would provide this capability. These satellites inaVSAT network would support ISDN user/network interfaces atthebasic 2B+D (144 kb/s) channel rate orprimary 23B+D (1.544 Mb/s) channel rate. Broadband DAMA satellite systems would provide broadband-ISDN connectivity between ISDN switches, oractasa b\"oadband-ISDN switch forinterconnecting high volume-users. With co_unication satellite systems incorporated inISDN, itisuseful to examine end-to-end system performance with tools such asANSX3.102. Work has already begun inthis area with CCITT Recommendation G.821 foranend-to-end bit error rate (BER) ofix10.6onsatellite trunks for ISDN service (Ports, 1987).
