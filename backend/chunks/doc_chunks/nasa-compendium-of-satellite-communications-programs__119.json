Raisting, Deutsche Bundespost 9.1/25 (30/82) 1963/ Germany 1964 *Existing terminal with receiver modified for use with Telstar. Terminal employed a pyramidal horn reflector. 6.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Andover terminal was the principal terminal involved in the experiments performed, with many of them being conducted on a loop-back basis. Major demonstrations were performed over a link between Andover and terminals in Europe or at Holmdel. The satellite orbits, described in Table 6-2, were in agreement with plans to provide the maximum realizable visibility per day and per pass while employing 6-3 a Delta rocket launched from Cape kennedy. The highdi \"apogeb given.to tTelstay II:­ was to reduce the amount of time speiit dn, the most 'intehsetrbgions of the radiation­ environment, ther eby minimizing damage to radiatibn sensitive components. - Operating frequencies in the Telstar program were as displayed in Table'6-4. (8) The communication frequencies selected were based on considerations of propagation, link noise, bandwidth, hardware available, and, the feasibility of frequency sharing between commercial satellite communications and existing terrestrial services. (3) The bands selected share spectrum occupancy with common carrier line-of-site radio relay'systems. The lower frequency bind was selected for the downlink -because of the reduced effects of precipitation and atmospheric absorption.

(8-11) Power control for multiple access was greatly improved at Andover by employing computer-derived slant range signals to vary the power amplifier output to compensate for changes in the range tothe satellite. Power balancing was accomplished manually by coordinating between terminals.. Margins provided had to account for variations in satellite antenna gain as a function of satellite aspect angle to"}
