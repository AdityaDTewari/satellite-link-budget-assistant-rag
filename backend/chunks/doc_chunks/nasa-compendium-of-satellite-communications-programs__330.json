The satellite VHIF transponder also provided the opportunity to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of a meteorological network in which data from small unmanned stations are collected at a central station for dissemination to all interested stations within the satellite coverage area; (2) investigate the feasibility of VHF navigation systems using satellites; and (3) study the practicality of disseminating time via a VHF satellite.

Experiment Categories Number Description 1 VHF & SHI Radio Communications and Propagation 2 Meteor6logical-Concepts, Applications and Techniques 3 Navigation and Position Location Techniques 4 Despun Antenna Systems 5 Measurements of the Earth Environment 6' Technology Applicable to Spacecraft Stabilization and Stationkeeping 7 Miscellaneous Aspects of Spacecraft Design Two active repeater satellites employing spin, stabilization, ATS-1 and ATS-3, were launched during the ATS program as indicated in Table 13-2. (3)(4) ATS-1 '' (i. e., ATS-B prior to launch) was successfully launched into a geostationary orbit and positioned over the Pacific Ocean where it has remained. Its initial program of communications related, experiments, including radio -communications, propagation, and the electronically despun antenna, were all successfully completed and the space­ craft at this writing is being employed for further experimentation. Concurrently, the remaining scientific experiments were also completed and were successful. (5) 13-3 ATS-3 (I. e. , ATS-C prior to launch) was successfully placed into a geostationary orbit almost a year after the launching of ATS-1; it was initially positioned over the Atlantic Ocean. The location was later shifted westward to a position over the eastern Pacific Ocean at a longitude near the eastern edge of Mexico; it is now located over South America. The satellite's experiments enjoyed results similar to those attained with ATS-1 and it also is presently being employed for additional experimentation."}
