In early 1969, a Tacsat spacecraft was placed into a geostationary orbit and used along wlih the latest LES satellite to further demonstrate and develop a tactical military satellite communications capability. Tacsat included both UHF and SHF transponders, an input/output switching capability. and an ability to vary transponder bandwidth that afforded multiple commandable modes of operation, including cross­ band configurations. By early 1971, prototype operational tactical terminals, at both UHF and SHF, had been demonstrated for aircraft, ship or land mobile use. In addi­ tion, operational frequency-hopping MFSK modems had been displayed. This approach was selected over pseudonoise PSK due to shorter acquisition times in a random-access environment, relaxed synchronization reqlirements, and a grdater resistance to the multipath likely to occur in many tactical situations (e. g., as for aircraft communi­ cation at elevation angles below 200). In late 1969, the final ATS spacecraft designed for gravity gradient stabilization was launched. The launch vehicle performed properly but control of the satellite was lost during an initial spin stabilized period before location on-station in a geostationary orbit. As a result, the spacecraft was left spinning about a longitudinal axis such that it could not be despun and the gravity gradient booms deployed. By early 1971, this final failure to demonstrate reliable gravity gradient stabilization at synchronous 1-22. altitude, along with the successful development of despun antennas, had caused interest in this technique to wane. In spite of the improper stabilization, L-Band and milli­ meter wave experiments included on this satellite were vperformed, and valuable data was obtained that will contribute towards opening these frequencies for future use. The millimeter wave frequencies evaluated were at 15.3 and 31. 65 GHz. Finally, in early 1971, Intelsat successfully launched the first of a fourth genera­ tion Intelsat"}
