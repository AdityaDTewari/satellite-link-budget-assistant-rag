The extent of this period will depend on the availability of the equipment and the necessary procurement of funds. To improve the efficiency of the digital transmissions in Stage 1c, error cor­ rection coding equipment will be procured. This coding equipment will allow the transmission of digital data using smaller amounts of satellite power with increased bandwidth, thus allowing larger amounts of digital communications to be processed through the Phase II satellites. Contingency operations will continue to be handled in Stage lc as they were in Stage lb by using the AN/TSC-54 terminals and operating via the satellite's NB-to-NB or cross-strap channels. Unprotected traffic will be transmitted in Stage ic using either analog FM or digital PSK transmissions, depending on the requirements and the availability of the digital equipment. Protected traffic will be provided in the early period of Stage lc at it was in Stage lb by using the AN/URC-55 and AN/URC-61 PN equipment. However, later in Stage 1c, the new AN/USC-28 PM equipment should be available and will be deployed in all DCS/DSCS earth terminal locations. In addition to increased antijam protection, the AN/USC-28 will provide the operational capability to establish a protected network 17-24 orderwire. This network orderwire will not only provide the capability of a real-time SATCOM control, but will provide a systemwide timing capability imperative to a future TDMA operation. As more digital equipment is procured and deployed in the DSCS, Stage 1c will evolve over a period of time into an all-digital communications system (Stage 2 with TDMA equipment) satisfying all DCS/DSCS traffic requirements using PCM and TDM/PSK. 17.5 EXPERIMENTS The DSCS Phase II is an operational, not an experimental system."}
