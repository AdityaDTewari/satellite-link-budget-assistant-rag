Within theaccuracy oftherequired statistics therelation XPD(dB)=47-25lOglo(A ) will beutilized.Substituting theattenuation values foragiven percentage oftheyear (from Figure 6.7-5) into this relation yields theXPDstatistics forrain shown inFigure6.7-10. Based onthese results theCPDwill exceed 20dBduring 99.9% oftheyear.L. !. However, forlowattenuation levels (high XPD's), icewill introduce depolarization. Acrude estimate ofthis effect canbemade based onthedata inFigure 6.7-5. Namely, when As1dBabout 30%more XPDevents occur dueto iceandrain, than just rain alone. This translates thedatapoint inFigure 6.7-10 corresponding toA=1dBfrom about 0.18 percent oftheyear to (1.3)(0.18%) =0.23% oftheyear (indicated bya0inFigure 6.7-10). Thus theXPDcurve israised upforlowvalues ofattenuation. Forattenuations above 3dBtherain plus icedepolarization plots areessentially allrain effects. Note that onecould have added intheeffect oficedepolarization by translating thecorresponding rain andiceXPD's. This isprobably less accurate because high values ofXPDareequipment dependent. Therefore an average value of30%icecontribution wasselected rather than converting each 326 valueofXPDusing datashowninFigure 6.7-5. This correction isbased on very preliminary results from asinglegeographic location andshould beadded only toshow atrend, since theabsolute value isprobably inerror. 6.8 ADDITIONAL PROPAGATION FACTORSRELATED TOSYSTEM DESIGN 6.8.1 Contents ofthis Section Several other factors affect trans-tropospheric transmissions from satellites. Among these are Dispersion Skyandextraterrestrial noise When thedispersionofthepropagating medium issufficientlyhigh, thephaseand/or amplitude ofwide-bandwidth transmissions maybeselectively altered. Thetropospheric effects have been predicted andmeasured tobe small, butionospheric dispersion maybesignificant below 10GHz. Therefore, inthis section theionospheric effects onthepath areconsidered. Measurements areunderway with theCOMSTAR satellites at28.56_ 0.264 GHzbyBell Laboratories. Results ofthese measurements areonly now becoming available. They indicate that dispersionisnotaproblem at28 GHz. Thefirst available datawasobtained from theATS-6 satellite andis presented here.
