Mobile phone-like connections for marine and mobile services have been with us for some time, however. Satellite services have some big advantages, such as being available almost everywhere on Earth without wires, being mobile, being the perfect broadcast medium, and being protocol agnostic. The downside to satellite technology is that satellites have either a limited visibility over a spot on Earth, or a long round-trip time, and they broadcast data that can be received by anyone under them. Satellite transmissions are also affected by both terrestrial and space weather. They are subject to a higher error rate than fiber, and they are complex from both a physical and regulatory point of view. Satellites are launched from Earth by the shuttle, from high-flying airplanes, or from ground-based rockets. Once launched, payloads must reach proper elevation and escape velocity to be boosted into orbit. In order to maintain proper orbit, satellites are iAAtoccnc th- cnmnnnento venii;~aA fnr 9 cmtall;to-hicoA rnmmzrn;,-mt;nnc cxrctom UU~”““”” ..LA” w”Luy”-”l*ru ‘”‘IU” vu LVI Y “YbYIIL.” “IUIU “V.A.A*I-*I“..c*VILy “J UCVL.., Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN controlled from a ground station on Earth that sends commands and receives status and telemetry from the satellite. 2. ORBITS Satellites are classified by the distance of their orbits above the Earth. Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites are located at an altitude of from 100 to 1200 miles, and Medium Eartl Orbits (lVEO) are located at m althtde of from 4,000-!2,000 riles. Geo- stationary orbits are located exactly 23.4 miles high. There are two Van Allen radiation belts around the Earth. These areas of intense radiation are to be avoided in deploying satellites. The"}
