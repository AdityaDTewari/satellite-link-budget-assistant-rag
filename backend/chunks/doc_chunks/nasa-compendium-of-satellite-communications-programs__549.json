In orbit, ANIK's 4-kilogram (9-pound) antenna remains stationary, pointed toward Canada, as the 2-meter (5-foot) high cylindrical body of the satellite revolves at 100 rpm. Two omnidirectional antennas--a cloverleaf to receive commands and a bicone to send telemetry information--are mounted atop the parabolic reflector. Antenna despin control is achieved by a signal processor comprised of a direc­ tional antenna receive feed assembly acting on a ground-generated pilot signal. Economies in system design have been realized through several steps taken to lessen the satellite's weight and hence its cost in orbit. These steps include satellite attitude determination on the ground rather than by on-board spacecraft hardware, extensive use of thin-walled invar filter waveguides, and affixing the squared solar cells to panels attached to the outer cylindrical body of the spacecraft with rubber cement rather than epoxy. Figure 18-6 shows the Telesat general configuration. The design provides for 10-channel operation during sun eclipse periods when the system must be powered by an on-board battery system. During normal sunlight operation only 10 channels would be in operation, with the remaining two channels used for standby operation. ANIK I has a capacity of more than 5,000 telephone circuits or 12 color TV chan­ nels. Approximately 20,.000 solar cells, each 2 centimeters square, are attached to the cylindrical body of the satellite. The cells provide about 300 watts of dc power. In addition to the solar panel arrays, the satellite is equipped with two nickel cadmium batteries made up of four separate seven-cell packs. These provide electrical energy 18-15 7 TRACKING a -COMMAND ANTENNAS COMMUNICATIONA NTENNA SOLAR . . -/ --SHIELDS PANEL MOTOR -BEARING = SHELF -THRUST TUBE -­ -':UPFCRT"}
