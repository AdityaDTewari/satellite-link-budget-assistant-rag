(7) Upon termination of this synchronous satellite project, the Fort Dix, Camp Roberts, and Kingsport terminals required only relatively minor modifications to become part of the Syncom program. Basic signal processing techniques used in the Syncom program were as indicated in Table 8-4. (3) (4) Power balancing for duplex operation was accomplished manually by coordinating between terminals via leased conventional circuits. Margins for duplex operation were quite narrow but had to account only for rain losses, inaccurate 8-5 Table 8-3.
