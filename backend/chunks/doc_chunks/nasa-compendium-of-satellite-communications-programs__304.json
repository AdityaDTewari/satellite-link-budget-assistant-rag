Overall re­ sponsibility for the DSCP was assigned to the Defense Communications Agency (DCA). This first major step was called the DSCP Phase I, and, as it was implemented, was an outgrowth of Army participation in NASA's Project SYNCOM and an initial system concept calling for medium altitude satellite orbits. By participating in the SYNCOM Program, the Army gained a nucleus of ground terminals and operating ex­ perience applicable in the DSCP Phase I. (1) The satellites resulting from the initial medium altitude system concept were simple state-of-the-art spacecraft. Subse­ quent to their design, the Titan IIIC became available as a launch vehicle. 2 In June 1966, the first seven Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) Phase I satellites were successfully orbited by a Titan IIIC booster. The initial objectives of shown in Table 12-1. (4)(5)the program are No ground commands were permitted in developing the hardware for the DSCS Phase I-satellite. However, simplicity and conservatism were stressed in the de­ sign of the communication subsystem."}
