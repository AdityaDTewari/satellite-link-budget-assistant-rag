(2) During the short operational lifetime of Courier Ib the satellite performance was (in general) good and in agreement with expectations. Spin rate was observed to decay at the rate of about 1 rpm per month. Performance exceptions involved the tape recorders and command system. One of the five tape recorders became stuck at an endstop and further recording or 4-9 playback was impossible. Command system malfunctions resulted in an operational effectivity of only about 95 to 97-percent; Malfunctions included failure to respond to commands, improper command acknowledgements, response to improper access codes, and in one case improper execution of the command sent. - Jamming resistance tests involved CW interference to theVHF link and both CWand pulse interference with the UHF message link. (2) Th6 system \"was found to be readily susceptible to jamming of either the UHF or VHF links, as might be expected since no antijamming features were incorporated. UHF link signal-to­ jamming ratios of 5to 7 dB had to be maintained to preserve system operation in the presence of CWjamming. With pulse jamming, the signal-to-jamming ratio required appeared to be somewhat higher. The communications performance tests described in Table 4-7 are defined in Table 4-8. (2) The table also includes primary results obtained. A precise evaluation of link parameters was not-obtained, since spin axis attitude. could be determined only from surface temperature sensors and received signal level, and spin rate was determined from the received signal level alone. As a result; highly accurate real time satellite antenna gain data was not available. In both the record and playback modes,, delayed repeater operation required 6-second lags before initiating signal transfers to allow tape recorders to reach operational speed. In addition to the tests listed in Table 4-8, Courier Ibwas"}
