Figure 7shows theflow ofthis control information through the various TDM_ bursts ofthe uplink and down link frames. Figures 8and9show theuplink anddown link TDMA frame structure in greater detail, illustrating dwell time slot andfade control allocations. Theuplink TDMA frame (Figure 8)starts inMCPspot dwell time slot number onewith acontrol burst (CB) from themaster control station (MCS). The CB contains thecontrol instructions fortheBBPdata routing processor (DRP) and outbound order wire information from theMCStotheuser earth stations. The CBistransmitted with FECcoding. Next are the uncoded traffic bursts (UTB's) from the active user earth stations. TheUTB's contain theinbound order wire information andtheuser's data traffic. OneUTBperframe issent from theNASA ground station (NGS) and each active user station. Ifthe NGS orauser station needs fade compensation, theMCS instructs ittomove thetraffic bursts tothe\"Pooled Fade Control Slots\" shown inFigure 8(b)and tosend itasacoded traffic burst (CTB). These bursts contain theinbound order wire andterminal traffic butaretransmitted during thespecial time slots with rate 1/2FECcoding and reduced burst rate. Thefinal burst intheuplink TDMA frame isthetransmit acquisition burst (TAB) sent from user earth stations first entering thenetwork. TheTAB is used forearth station timing acquisition andnetwork synchronization. Like theCBtheTABisalso FECcoded. The down link TDMA frame (Figure 9)starts inMCP spot dwell time slot number onewith theorder wire burst (OWB) totheMCS. TheOWBcontains the BBPstatus messages andanaggregate oftheinbound order wire information from alltheactive user earth stations. TheOWBJsalways sent with FECcoding. Next isthe reference burst (RB) containin Fthe outbound order wire information and tracking error words (TEW's) foreach earth station.
