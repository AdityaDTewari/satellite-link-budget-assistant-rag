Communications services for voice and data traffic within and between Alaska and the 48 contiguous states are provided by RCA Alascom and RCA Globcom. NOTE: The RCA communications satellite, Satcom I, was launched December 12, 1975. Transponder testing is scheduled to begin in January 1976, and com­ mercial traffic is scheduled to begin in late February. 20-35 20.5 WESTERN, UNION 20. 5.1 Program Description The Western Union domestic satellite system program was aimed at providing an early entry into the U.S. marketplace. Satellites almost identical to the Anik were or­ dered from Hughes. The five earth terminals were ordered from ITT Space Communica­ tions. Operations began in July 1974 after launch and initial checkout of Westar I. 20.5.2 System Description The Westar system augments Western Union's extensive microwave relay system which runs across the United States from east to west and also into Texas.
