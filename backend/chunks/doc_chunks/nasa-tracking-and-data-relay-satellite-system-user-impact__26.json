The two most signfiicant variables are the antenna size versus the satellite structure size. The curve illustrated in Figure 4.2 shows a typical test result from NRL test analysis(6) of spacecraft interaction effects with satellite structures. In this test, a turnstile antenna was mounted on a spherical spacecraft body. For varying spacecraft to antenna size, various degrees of pattern differences were observed. Generally speaking, as the satellite size is increased more numerous and deeper null appear as part of the 4-9 composite antenna/spacecraft characteristic. Besides spacecraft size, there are other factors affecting the antenna design; among the more important are geometry, element type and its location. Material properties have, at least for the turnstile design, been found to effect changes in performance. Because of the numerous variables involved in the specification of the ultimate radiation characteristics of a low gain antenna, the antenna system integration problem is extremely difficult. Generally speaking before a system engineer can objectivdly select an appropriate design for his mission he is required to understand the impact of all spacecraft structural effects on all antennas from which he is making a selection so that he may choose the design which is more optimum for his application. This type of required data, unfortunately, is not readily available. It couldhowever be determined partially through a systematic investigation. In order to establish which low gain antenna design is most appropriate to a particular spacecraft geometry, it is valuable to conduct either a survey or a numerical and experimental investigation. The experimental approach involves the fabrication of various spacecraft structures and testing them in conjunction with different antenna configura- tions. A similar, however, for the same cost, more complete evaluation could be"}
