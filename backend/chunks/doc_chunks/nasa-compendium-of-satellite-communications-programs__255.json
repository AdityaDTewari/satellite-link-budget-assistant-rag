This situation began to change with the development of the INTELSAT IV space­ craft. When the spot beams of this satellite are employed witlh high performance ground terminals, a bandwidth limited system results. The INTELSAT IV satellites' communications subsystem consists of global receive and both global and spot beam transmit antennas connected to a 12-channel repeater that provides"}
