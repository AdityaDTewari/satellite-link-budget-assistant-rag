After the balloon set for Goldstone, Stump Neck then transmitted to Holmdel. On a few passes, both Goldstone and Stump Necksimultaneeusly transmitted to Holmdel, using circular polarizations of opposite sense and slightly different transmit frequencies. Echo I provided periods of mutual visibility up to about 15 minutes for Holmdel and Goldstone and 25 minutes for Holmdel and Stump Neck. .3-5 30.5 (100) 9r L 2 \"(60 is\\ KILOMTES \\' -- 160HN.DIS DIHE -IS­-/\"I N TA~~fE RECEIVESl KW K N.K OTAdHOLMDEL0 General Features of the Echo I ExperimentFigure C-i. For the Echo II communication experiments, the system configuration for the principal participants was as illustrated in Figure 3-2. (10) The configuration was such as to provide half duplex communications as the primary mode of operation. Normally, Dallas transmitted while Stump Neck or Columbus or both received. Dallas could transmit on either of-two frequencies and Stump Neck could receive either of these frequencies. However, Columbus received on only one of the Dallas trans­ mit frequencies. The Dallas site included a second transmit antenna used in radar tracking operations to a receiver operating off the communications transmitting antenna. Radar tracking was performed at a separate frequency from the communication frequencies, and Stump Neck included a receive capability at that frequency. Stump Neck also included a communications transmit capability for use in special cases. East Coast to West Coast mutual visibilities were increased over those for Echo I by the higher orbital inclination of Echo II. Frequencies employed for communications and radar tracking operations with the Echo satellites spanned a wide range extending from VHF to S-band. This was a result of performance as a function of frequency, being, in general, unaffected by these passive reflectors. Strictly speaking, fading, due to scattering from the wrinkled skin of"}
