In order to reduce these gains to more modest levels, it is recommended that either the user's receiving system noise temperature be reduced or the TDRS transmit power be increased, or some combination of both. With respect to the former, the current Hughes TDRS baseline makes use of bipolar silicon transistors which provide an overall noise temperature of 540 K, a reduction of 4.5 dB below the assumed 1500 K user noise temperature. It is hoped that such a reduction in noise temperature can also be achieved by the users. 5-8 6. REFERENCES 1.
