The terminals, in addition to those indicated in Table 10-6, participating in operations with INTELSAT II satellites, as of April 1968, are listed in Table 10-7. INTELSAT II satellites located over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans provided multiple-access communications among appropriate groups of these terminals. The wide variety of station antenna sizes stems largely from the fact that many of the smaller ones were 10-13 Table 10-6. INTELSAT I Participating Earth Terminals Ant. Dia.

Many of the smaller aperture stations have now been replaced by' ones of higher sensitivity. Their existence did, however, provide experience in working with a variety of stations with a wide range of sensitivities. System planning for the INTELSAT III satellite was completed in 1967, and,a third generation of earth stations was"}
