Bicone antenna radiation patterns 4-30 4.3.5 Short Backfire Antenna (20) The short backfire antenna provides circular polarization by using a crossed dipole feed as shown in Figure 4.11, or linear polarization by using a single dipole. The antenna consists of two plane reflectors spaced approximately a half wavelength apart with the feed placed between them. The primary reflector is cupped to form a cavity. The antenna surfaces can be made from either perforated sheet metal or wire mesh with aluminum ribs. Stowage and deployment of this type of antenna will be necessary in most instances. Typical radiation patterns for the backfire antenna are shown in Figure 4.12, and characteristics and performance are summarized in Table 4.7.
