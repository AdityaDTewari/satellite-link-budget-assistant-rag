It should be noted that although the Nutley Test Station employed the same communications antenna, they were separate operations. The Communications Satellite Operations Center was established to handle experimental scheduling, daily operations planning, and data processing. This center also provided a centralized command post to exercise control over the satel­ lite. Supporting activities included telemetry data processing, orbital prediction, and satellite tracking information. 7.5 EXPERIMENTS Each of the participating stations was asked to submit a"}
