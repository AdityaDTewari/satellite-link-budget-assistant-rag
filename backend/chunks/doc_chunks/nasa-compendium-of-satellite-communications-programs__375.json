If the booms could be deployed the latter two could be successfully completed. Noteworthy successes have been obtained from the earth environment measurements, L-Band and millimeter wave experiments. The latter two were obtained through ground terminal modifications to accommodate the periodic nature of the received signal, caused by the spacecraft spin. For the millimeter wave experiment, the spacecraft spin rate (i. e., 76 rpm) resulted in a received signal pulse having a 26 ms time duration between 1 dB down points,, that occurred every 789ims( 3 6 ) -Ground complex modifications- to accommodate this type of received signal included exclusive employment of program tracking rather than autotracking, installing a manual override to prevent the receiver phase lock loop 'from going into a search mode during deep fades of the peak signal, tripling the data sampling rate, to 108 samples-per-second (i. e., one every 9.2 ms) and selecting the maximum valued sample as the only valid data point during any given second. Detrimental effebts of the spacecraft spin have included loss of the milli­ meter wave to L-band TV transmission capability, a loss of fade measurement range which in itself was not of major significance, a serious degradation of the differential sideband phase measurement capability due to spin-induced doppler effect and 13-51 settling time of the quadrature phase detectors, and loss of the ability to detect short term signal fades occuring at rates greater than about 0. 5 Hz. The detrimental effects of spacecraft spin plus a 9, dB drop in primary transmitter outputs, occurring about 3 months after satellite launch, also made it impossible to obtain coherence bandwidth measurements at 15.3 GHz.
