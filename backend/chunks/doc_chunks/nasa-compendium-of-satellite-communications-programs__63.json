(1)(2)(5) The ground tests employed prototype spheres. to confirm sphericity and structural integrity of basic balloon design. The vacuum chamber tests evaluated balloon release from its containing canister, unfolding, and inflation during free fall at NASA's Langley Research Center. The balloon deployment system 'was refined and space-qualified during four launches into a ballistic trajectory by modified Sargent rockets from NASA's Wallops Island, Virginia, launch site. These launches were code-named Shotput I through IV. The first launch on 28 October 1959 3-1 resulted in the sphere rupturing into a thousand pieces. After two more tests on 16 January 1960 and 27 February 1960 and changing the folding pattern, inflation system, and prelaunch payload conditioning cycle, a successful vertical test was conducted on 4 January 1960.
