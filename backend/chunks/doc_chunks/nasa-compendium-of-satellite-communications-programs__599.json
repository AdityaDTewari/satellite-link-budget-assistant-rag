Each ground terminal has the capability of receiving and transmitting multidestination FDM radio carriers which establish connec­ tions with the other stations. In Phase I plans, there are four terminals so that each will transmit one FDM carrier and receive three FDM carriers. In Phase H of ASC plans, the capability of interconnecting with two satellites simultaneously will be added. The ASC system is also to include receive-only terminals which will be capable of being located in regions congested with interfering signals so that operation will be possible over only a portion of the allocated band. A photograph of an ASC terminal is shown in Figure 20-1. The Phase I, Phase II, and receive-only terminal characteristics are 20-2 0! II Figure 20-1.

Major receive function and transmit function block diagrams of the ASC Phase II earth terminals are presented in Figures 20-2 and 20-3, respectively. 20.2.5 Operational Results The ASC domestic system has been in operation since August 1974. Facsimile, voice, and data transmissions are carried through the operational system. 20-4 ---- ---- ----Table 20-1.
