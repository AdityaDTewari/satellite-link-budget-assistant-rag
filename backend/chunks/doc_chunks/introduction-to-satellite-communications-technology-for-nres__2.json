Geo- stationary orbits are located exactly 23.4 miles high. There are two Van Allen radiation belts around the Earth. These areas of intense radiation are to be avoided in deploying satellites. The two zones separate LEO and ME0 orbits. LEG and ivE0 (sub-geosynchronous j orbiring sareiiires are visitxe for oniy a period of time from the point of view of an observer on Earth. Satellites in these orbits can communicate with the Earth by “pass of€” to a fleet of like satellites providing full Earth coverage. They can also pass off to a geosynchronous relay satellite, or they can dump data to the ground as they pass over a ground station. Most of these “near Earth” satellites are in orbits that go over or near the poles; some go over the same place on Earth at least several times a day. The coordination and placement of Earth stations to “operate” and take data from these satellites is a major consideration in the life cycle of a satellite. The advantage of sub-geo satellites over those in geosynchronous orbit is that lower orbits are less expensive to launch, it takes less power to send and receive data, and the round trip time from Earth is faster. . .. . 0 THE0 (Twelve Hour Eccentric Orbits, or Molniya orbits) are not quite polar orbits that stay in a hemisphere for half of a day. This approach allows for two ME0 satellites to cover an area of the Earth, thus giving continuous service as a geosynchonous satellite would. This was developed and used extensively in Russia. Geosynchronous orbits are the most desirable and the most expensive to obtain. “Geosynch” satellites appear stationary to observers on the"}
