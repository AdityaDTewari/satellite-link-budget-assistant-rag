U. S. To demonstrate the feasibility of extending li­ brary services to rurally isolated communities. Included would be. an extension of library services to local officials, small businessmen, and para­ professionals; as well. as the maintenance of a regional bibliographic data bank. U.S. This is a follow-on to the STD experiment on ATS-6 and will provfde for the distribution of career counseling information to grades 9, 10, 11. The experiment will also disseminate information to state services and promote land use.planning. Canada The following propagation factors will be meas­ ured: polarization isolation, low angle effects, and precipitation attenuation. Canada The performance of a novel synchronization technique will be tested and used as the basis for implementing a TDMA (Time-Division Multiple-Access) experimental system. Data from the synchronization experiment will be used to make very accurate determinations of the satellite position and orbit.

CTS Experiments (3 of 8) Country Objective Canada This experiment will evaluate a Frequency- Division Multiple-Access Demand Assignment (FDMA/DA) system for small terminal remote area satellite communications with particular application to two-way, voice communications. Canada A simple modulation-demodulation equipment (modem) at a high rate of transmission (about 65 Mb/s) will be evaluated for use in data ex­ periments and particularly, the transmission of digital TV. Canada An experiment will be undertaken by CRC with the cooperation of CTS experimenters to evaluate in­ stallation, operation and maintenance factors in the use of the Voice and Audio Program Remote User Experimental Terminal and the Video Inter­ active Remote User Experimental Terminal. Canada This experiment will evaluate the reception, in"}
