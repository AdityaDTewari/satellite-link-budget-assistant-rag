This \"sky noise\"contribution was neglectedearlier. Thenominal composite C/Nforthedigital system clearly exceeds the minimum required foratleast 80%ofthetime (10.7 dB).When rain attenuation andskynoise have been included, however, thecomposite C/Nis 0.4dBlessthan therequired value for99%ofthetime (9.0 dB).Wenote that this deficiency canbeeasily madeup byincreasing theuplink transmitted power to40W(16dBW). Thecorresponding power budget calculations arecarried outforthe analog example inTable 7.3-5. Inthis case, thenominalcomposite C/N exceeds theminimum bynearly 4dB,andthedegradedvalue is0.8dBbetter than required.

Those contributions include self-interference, interference from other satelliteandterrestrial systems, andintermodulation inthesatellite repeater. Self-interference mayarise from crosstalk between frequency bands, orthogonalpolarizations, antenna patterns,orcombinations ofthethree, as determined bythesystem architecture. 7.3.6.5 Iterate System Design andAnalysis.
