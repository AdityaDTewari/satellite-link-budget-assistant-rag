In the case of INTELSAT IV and IVA, the band­ width shown spans the total operating frequency range of 12 and 20 independent re­ peaters, respectively: Downlink center frequenbies for each of the 12 repeaters of IV are: 3725, 2765, 3805, 3845, 3885, 3925, 3975, 4015, 4055, 4095, 4135, and 4175 MHz, respectively. In IVA the frequencies are reused to increase the capability effectively to 20 independent repeaters as previously explained. Uplink frequencies for each repeater are 2225 MHz above the indicated downlink frequency. The fre­ quencies employed were selected to be compatible with the frequency bands reserved for commercial satellite communications use on a shared basis in 1963. These fre­ quencies were set aside in response to recommendations originated by AT&T during the Telestar program. With the extensive ground complex and comparatively limited number of space­ craft involved in the INTELSAT program, satellite multiple-access techniques and RF modulation employed have been of vital importance to the system. INTELSAT I incorporated a multiple-access capability, in a sense, by virtue of its sharing a single TWT between two independent frequency-translating transponders. Since each of these transponders was hardlimiting in nature, the number of carriers accessing each was limited to one. For this reason, the mode of communication was point-to­ point, and only one duplex link between the United States and Europe was provided. Conventional voice-channel multiplex equipment similar to that employed in the Bell System and frequency modulation of the radiated carriers were employed. This sys­ tem configuration, in conjunction with the ground terminals available, provided INTELSAT I with a 240-duplex voice-channel capacity. The INTELSAT II system was designed to provide for frequency-division multiple­ access (FDMA) of the satellite by a number of earth terminals. Theoretical studies had shown"}
