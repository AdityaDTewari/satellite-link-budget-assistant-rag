The spinning section contained solar cells, batteries, auxiliary telemetry, tracking, and command equipment, despin control electronics, the hydrogen peroxide propulsion system, and the nitrogen spinup system. A pendulum liquid damper was used for nutation damping. The intent of the program was to provide experimental hardware for testing tac­ tical satellite communications and, therefore, to be conservative in the spacecraft development approach. Space-proven technology was used wherever possible. How­ ever, the satellite requirements could not be met without some major advances in spacecraft technology. These included: use of the gyrostat stabilizing concept; intri­ cacy of the repeater design; use of beryllium within the structure; development of a new 20-watt TWT; and development of load-bearing solar panels. 14-7 Table 14-6.
