This experiment is designed to provide propagation data at 20 GHz and 30 GHz over a 1 44 GHz bandwidth.

These grequencies are rapidly becoming overcrowded, and the in­ creasing communications demands of our expanding society require the systems de­ signer to look.toward higher frequencies. While the millimeter-wave bands offer a promising area to alleviate this crowding, these frequencies can be more severely affected by adverse atmospheric conditions than the lower frequencies. During this experiment, signals will be generated by ATS-61s millimeter-wave experiment system and recorded on earth by a number of special ground stations lo­ cated in the U.S. and Canada. 'Weather conditions also will be monitored at each sta­ tion. Table 13-40 shows the data parameters for the experiment. ATS-6Is millimeter-wave experiment package essentially consists of four traveling-wave-tube transmitters tuned to the 20 and 30 GHz frequencies and each 13-119 Table 13-40.
