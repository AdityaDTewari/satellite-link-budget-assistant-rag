VHF tests were conducted in all of these configurations from loop back through full duplex linking. Satellite transponder non-linearity, plus power and bandwidth limitations, tended to limit multiple access capabilities. The NASA­ furnished terminals provided two functions in the VHF tests. They conducted base­ line evaluations of the satellite VHF transponder and theVHF propagation link to serve as a reference for testing with mobile and remote'data terminals. The NASA terminals also participated in the latter tests as central land bases. Typical earth coverages supplied by the geostationary satellites, ATS-1 and ATS-3, are shown in Figure 13-1. Operating frequencies for the spin stabilized Applications Technology Satellites are shown in Tables 13-4, 5, and 6. (5) The 6-and 4-GHz frequencies were selected to be compatible with the international allocations for commercial satellite communi­ cations. The VHF frequencies were selected for a communications experiment because of compatibility with existing frequencies employed for spacecraft TT&C and conventional hardware that could readily be supplied for small mobile terminals (e. g., aircraft terminals). 13-6 60 60 TERMINAL ANTEINA EL EVATION ANGLE. 3O ; 0120 IS0 180 160 120 90 6D 30 Figure 13-1.
