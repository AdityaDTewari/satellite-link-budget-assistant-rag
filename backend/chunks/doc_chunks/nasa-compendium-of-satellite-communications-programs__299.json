Further, the experiments that may have been conducted are not well documented to the Western World. It is possible that, when the first Molniya-1 spacecraft began to appear in orbit, both the highly elliptical orbit employed and the three-axis stabilizdd satellite, with its sun-oriented solar panels and tracking antennas, were considered experimental in nature. Obviously, these experiments worked out well, since the operational system continued to incorporate the aforementioned features. Additionally, it is known that the Molniya satellites have been employed to provide measurements of the earth's -environment. The orbital paths of these satellites carry them through the earth's radiation belts several times each"}
