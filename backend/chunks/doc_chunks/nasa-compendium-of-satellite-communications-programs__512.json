A sub­ sequent Phase II system was implemented to provide an operational system during the 1971-1974 time period although only one of two satellites in space remains opera­ tional and has been placed in a ready condition. All 12 system acceptance tests have been completed. A Phase III follow-on system is planned for the 1975-1980 time period. Large satellites are being procured to replenish the space subsystem in late 1975. NATO is endeavoring to fill the expected gap in satellite communications (Phase II to Phase III) by making arrangements for sharing of the U. S. DSCS Phase II Atlantic satellite. Ten additional earth terminals are also expected to be acquired for the Phase III system. 16-22 CITED REFERENCES 1. \"In House NATO SATCOM Communication System Documentation, \" Computer Sciences Corporation, Falls Church, Virginia. 2.

Planning for a Phase I DSCS has been a continuing process con­ ducted concurrently with- the implementation of Phase I. Therefore, in June 1968, the DOD announced its decision to acquire six new satellites and additional earth terminals as the second phase of the DSCS. Phase I had successfully completed its research and development objectives and since late 1967 had been providing a limited operational capability. The basic objectives for the Phase II DSCS are found in Table 17-1. 'The Phase II DSCS remains"}
