The detrimental effects of spacecraft spin plus a 9, dB drop in primary transmitter outputs, occurring about 3 months after satellite launch, also made it impossible to obtain coherence bandwidth measurements at 15.3 GHz. Data was obtained on the statistibs of long-term fades, correlation between various attenuation prediction techniques and actual measured attenuation, effects of site diversity at 15.3 GHz, and coherent bandwidth at 31. 65 GHz. Preliminary results are tabulated in Table 13-27. (31), (34), (36) Table 13-27. Preliminary Results Millimeter Wave Experiment Type Experiment Nature of Results Obtained 1) Attenuation at 15. 3 GHz 1 to 3 dB in light rains or dense fog, 3 to 7 dB in continuous rains (5 to 50 mm/hr) and number of fades exceeding 12 dB in heavy thunder­ storms. 2) Evaluation attenuation prediction techniques Excellent results using radiometer measurements* of sky temperature. Fair results employing radar back­ scatter readings at millimeter wave frequency. -Better results at lower frequencies. Poor results using rain gage measurements of rainfall rate. Results improved with more gages over greater area. 3) Effects site diversity at 15.3 GHz Durations of 6 to 10 dB fades reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude using simple diversity system with 4 km ground separation between terminals. 4) Coherent bandwidth at 31. 65 GHz Measured relative amplitude variations of sidebands have been within +2 dB of carrier for sidebands at ±1. +10, and +L50 MHz. *Operating at same frequency as propagation link. 13-52 For the L-Band experiment, the spacecraft spin produced about a 22 ms sample time during which the received signal was within 1 dB of peak. The impact of the spinning spacecraft upon the original experiment objectives was that: a) all satellite loop tests"}
