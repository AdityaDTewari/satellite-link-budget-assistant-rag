Other satellite-based or satellite-augmented ISDN applications include small transportable terminals fortemporary network access and mobile ISDN connectivity. These ISDN-compatible satellites working in parallel with fiber trunks andterrestrial switches could also provide network backup andquick emergency service restoration. 1.2 Theincreasing Need forSystem Performance Measurements With communication satellite systems evolving into newroles, evolution is also required inperformance specification andmeasurement methods forthese systems, Twostrong reasons arepushing this need: i I.Communication satellite systems arebeing used foralarger portion ofdata communication networks. 2.Users arebecoming less concerned with thetechnical design issues ofdata communication systems and more concerned with finding systems that meet their needs. When satellites provide simple analog repeater service, the users are primarily concerned with thesystem capacity, measured asthenumber ofanalog voice circuits orvideo channels thesystem cansupport. This isafunction of themodulation techniques andthecarrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) ofthe i total satellite link (wh_re C/No isestablished bythe basic link budget calculations). Very often theusers arenotexperienced orinterested inthe details ofsatellite link budget calculations; however, they are very interested inhow well the system meets their capacity and availability requirements. Thus, users generally buy service frol0satellite service providers who design the users'links. Once established, the links are dedicated full time totheusers. The situation for digital satellite transmission links isnot much i different from that foranalog. Capacity isstill theyardstick formeasuring I performance and itstill depends onlink budget calculations. (Th_ signaling rate-dependent, bitenergy-to-noise density ratio [Eb/No] isused inplace of C/No astheprimary link budget parameter.) However, capacity isnowmeasured astheuser-information bitrate with aspecified biterror probability (Pc).
