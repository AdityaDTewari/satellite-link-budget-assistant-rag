These standards are proposed asameans forquantifying theend-to-end communication system performance ofcommunication satel]ite systems. Anintroductory overview ofthe twostandards are given followed byareview ofthe characteristics, applications, and advantages ofusing X3.102 and X3.141 toquantify the performance these classes ofcommunication satellites. Thereport concludes with adescription oftheapplication ofthese standards toACTS.
