The country covers nearly 9,656 In (6000 miles) from east to west and over 4,023 km (2500 miles) from north to south. For the Soviet Union, whose territory extends up to 800N latitude, geostationary orbits are not ideal because they do not ensure communications at earth station ele­ ° vation angles greater than 7.5 for all areas that lie above 700N latitude. The Soviet Union's communication satellites system, using the Molniya-1 and the more recent Molniya-2 spacecraft, circumvents this difficulty by employing the highly eccentric elliptical orbits described below. The orbit chosen for the Molniya satellites is interesting for two reasons. First, it is highly elliptical with an apogee of 39,633 km (21,400 n. mi.) in the northern hemi­ sphere, a perigee of 500 km (270 n. mi.) in the southern hemisphere and an orbital period of nearly 12 hours; Thus, the two daily orbital apogees for any given satellite occur 1800 apart over earth longitudes. Second, the angle of inclination of 650 means that the period during which one of the two daily orbits of the satellite can be employed for radio communication between distant points in the USSR is between 8 and 10 hours. The second daily orbit cuts diagonally across the Western Hemisphere on its ascending pass, and has been used on alimited basis to provide a Moscow-Cuba link. This secondary low utilization orbit (Figure 11-1) provides maximum mutual visibility of"}
