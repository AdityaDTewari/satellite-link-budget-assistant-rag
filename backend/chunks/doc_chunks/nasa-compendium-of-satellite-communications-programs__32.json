An Advanced Syncom program was initially conceived by NASA to study these problems. However, this soon evolved into the ATS program, which added a multitude of other space experiments to those designed to advance communications technology. The programs oriented toward realizing a system capable of supporting inter­ national commercial communications include Telstar and Intelsat. Telstar was an experimental program that contributed to general scientific knowledge. However, it was initiated by the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) Company primarily to demonstrate the feasibility of employing active satellites for commercial communi­ cations. Before the program was completed, AT&T was legislated out of international commercial satellite ownership by the Communications Satellite Act of 1962, creating the Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat). This was followed in 1964 by international interim agreements establishing Intelsat and including Comsat as the U. S. representative in this consortium of international partners. The Intelsat program was initiated immediately based on technology developed in NASA's Project Syncom. Foreign programs producing systems whose primary objective has been military communications include Molniya, Skynet, and NATO. The experimental beginnings upon which the Russian Molniya program was based are not publicly known. These spacecraft began to be placed in orbit in the mid-1960s and an operational system was soon established to provide military and some civilian communications. This system has been maintained since that time through replacement launches of similar, if not 1-11 identical, spacecraft. The Molniya II satellite is being used in parallel with the U. S. 's Intelsat for the Hotline, a direct communication link between Washington and Moscow. The Skynet and NATO programs evolved in the late 1960s and early 1970s from tech­ nology developed in the U. S. military's IDCSP program."}
