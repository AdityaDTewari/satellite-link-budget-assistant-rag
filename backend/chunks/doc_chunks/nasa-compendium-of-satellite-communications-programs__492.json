Both types of stations are identical, but the Type IVis helicopter trans­ portable, whereas the Type III is only transportable by standard aircraft. A simpli­ fied block diagram of the signal paths in the Type II and IV earth terminal is shown in Figure 15-7(5)(6). A five-horn static split system is used for tracking, and all the microvave equipment is mounted on the back of the antenna disk. The antenna mount is a simple two-axis elevation/azimuth system. The received signals pass through a diplexer and a band-stop filter to reject transmitted frequencies, and then into a two-stage liquid nitrogen-cooled parametric amplifier. Subsequently, they pass to a mixer/IF preamp combination and then to an IF amplifier where the FDM and spread spectrum signals are separated. The combined uplink IF signal is fed into the transmitter unit where it is converted to the final frequency, and amplified first in an intermediate power amplifier and then in a 15-20 •IN S MODULATORS SS BASEBAND -N XMIT NDRIVE SS DEMODULATORS EQUIPMENT T COMBINER XMIT1 UNIT UNITFM FM MODULATORS DEMODULATORS_7 4FM BASEBAND EQUIPMENT 4 I OUT I 01, PARAMP SERVO MOTORS l RF FILTERS aONVpTER DA'S DOWN RECEIVER Figure 15-6.
