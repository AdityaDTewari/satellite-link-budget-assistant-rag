It was configured so that seven large-capacity terminals would operate in the 20-MHz band, each trans­ mitting a single multidestination, 24-voice channel FM carrier, and that five medium­ capacity terminals would operate in the narrowband (2-MHz) channel, each transmitting a single multidestination, 3-channel FM carrier. Each large- and medium-capacity station receives and demodulates a number of carriers dependent on that station's connectivity. Figure 16-1 indicates the interconnectivity of the NATO SATCOM Phase II system. Table 16-3 shows the RF operating frequencies for the 2-MHz and 20-MHz channels. Table 16-4 gives the FM performance characteristics of the demodulators used in the Phase II system. Th e number of modes provided allow the system to change capacity and configuration as long-term requirements vary. 16-5 NORWAY GRMNANTL IL I, OTAL L7 ~f~IJP~CANA1DA Figure '6=1.
