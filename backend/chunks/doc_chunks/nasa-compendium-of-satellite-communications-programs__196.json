The basic signaling waveform was' a Tc secbnd sine wave puls'eoil'one\"of eightc frequencies spaced at I/T-HZ increments. Six bits-of information corresponding to sixty-four possible states of the input word were coded into a sequence of seven such (37)pulses using the (7, 2) octal Reed-Solomon code . An additional fixed frequency pulse started each seven pulse code word to aid -intime and frequency synchronization. Therefore, the time to transmit each code word was 8 T seconds. Since each code c 9-29 C each word contained six bits-of information, the data rate was 0. 75/T bits-per­ second. At the two data rates handled by the modem (i.e., 75 or 2400c bits/see), T was 10 msec. or 312.5 gs, respectively.
