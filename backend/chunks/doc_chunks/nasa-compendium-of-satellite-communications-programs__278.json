The primary components of the Antarctic station are­ a. A fixed pointing 2.4-m (8. 0-ft) antenna b. A 20-watt TWT output amplifier C. Electronics for data encoding d. Receiving system for processing command-signals and executing operations The station operates with a G/T of 7 dB/°K, and EIRP of 52 dBW and an antenna elevation angle to the nominal satellite format (1740E) of 3. 35, in a straight line, or approximately 3.6 with atmospheric bending. Orbital parameters of the satellite have caused it to remain within the 3-dB contour of the earth station antenna pattern, so that PSK transmissions from Antarctica have been-received 24-hours per day at Jamesburg with a C/N density of >51 dB-Hz, the nominal design value, and an error 7rate of! -in 10 The successful operation of the Antarctic terminal, the first unattended terminal to be used with an INTELSAT satellite, has demonstrated the ability of this type of station for special application. 10-59 RELATED REFERENCES 1.
