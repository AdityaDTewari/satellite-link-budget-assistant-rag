First two satellites never reached full capacity. Second two satellites operational. Plans exist for Phase III system. Two satellites operational. Third satellite has been procured; to be launched in 1975. Satellite being procured, launch expected in December 1975. No plans for additional satellites at present. One satellite active, numerous planned. developing strategic and tactical military communication systems. The evolution of the strategic systems began with the Score and Courier, experimental store-and­ forward satellites. It was continued almost 6 years later with the first IDCSP launch­ ing. In the interim period, the military attempted to develop three axis-stabilized satellites for launch into synchronous orbits i. e., Project Advent), developed the system concepts, and designed the space segment for a medium altitude random polar orbit system, and extensively considered the possibility of employing Intelsat for ser­ vice. Project Advent was terminated in 1962 when the launch vehicle and stabilization technology required proved to be beyond the state-of-the-art at that time. The medium altitude development was suspended when the potential economies of Intelsat service emerged. The latter was dropped for a number of reasons with the principal factor being the military requirement for a high degree of independentsystem control. The IDCSP concept provided some of the desired system economies by reducing the number of previously planned medium altitude satellites in random near synchronous orbits, using independently programmed and funded Titan 0ICdevelopmental launches. Be­ tween the termination of Project Advent and the first IDCSP launching, the military gained operational satellite communications experience by supplying the ground com­ plex and conducting the communication experiments on NASA's Project Syncom. Strategic military communications were advanced when the DSCS Phase I satellites became operational in early 1974. Further advances will be realized in the future when the planned DSCS Phase I satellites are introduced. Developing tactical systems"}
