Two independent orbit and orientation hydrazine reaction control systems are carried aboard the satellite, each consisting of two diametrically opposed titanium tanks, interconnecting gas and liquid lines, and two thrusters mounted just inboard aft of the solar panel. The nozzle of one thruster is oriented to fire nearly parallel with the spin axis and is used for orbital inclination control when fired in a steady state and for spacecraft orientation control when pulse-fired. The nozzle of the second thruster is oriented to fire through the satellite's average center of gravity. It is used only in the pulsed mode for orbital period and eccentricity control. Sufficient hydrazine is stored in the two systems to enable more than 7 years of stationary, zero-inclination stationkeeping. 18-17 The Telesat satellite is intermediate in size between the Intelsat III and Intelsat IV satellites. As in the Intelsat IV, the Telesat repeater is a single conversion with a wideband receiver and a transmitter having 12 separate channels. The 12 transmitter channels are capable of handling 12 television channels (10 eclipse conditions) or vari­ ous mixes of television, data, and voice. The satellite has a design life of 8 years. Table 18-5 summarizes the Telesat spacecraft characteristics. Table 18-6 sum­ marizes the general characteristics of ANIK's communication and T&C subsystems. Figure 18-7 is a block diagram of the ANIK on-board communications repeater. The frequency and polarization plan is given in the table in Figure 18-8. The tracking, telemetry, and command facilities required for Telesat missions are at three locations: the Allan Park station in Ontario, the Lake Cowichan station on Vancouver Island, and the island of Guam in the Pacific. The latter is a tracking sta­ tion which is used only"}
