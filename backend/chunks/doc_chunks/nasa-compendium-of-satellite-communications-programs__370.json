In addition to the communications-related subsystems, ATS-4 provided (29) a) hydrazine gas jets plus passive and active nutation control systems for spacecraft stabilization and stationkeeping during the period of spin stabilization; b) a two­ stage yo-yo despin mechanism; c) resisto jet and cesium ion microthrusters for stationkeeping during gravity gradient stabilization; d) a TV camera monitoring booms plus solar aspect and IR earth sensors to support the gravity gradient experiment; e) an image orthicon day-night camera as a meteorological experiment; and f) a magnetometer sensor measuring spacecraft charge as an environmental measurements experiment. In addition to the communications-related subsystems, ATS-5 provided (30) a) essentially the same equipment as listed in items a) through d) for ATS-4; b) an environmental measurements package including a tridirectional particle detector measuring protons with energies between 30 and 250 keV and electrons between 30 and 300 keV, a unidirectional particle experiment to study auroral particle fluxes, a bidirectional particle experiment to map electrons and protons on constant lines of force and determine properties of acceleration within the magnetosphere, an omnidirectional particle experiment measuring electrons in 12 discrete energy ranges and the flux of solar cosmic rays, a radiometer measuring solar radio 13-45 bursts between 50 kHz and 4 MHz, and an electric field measurements. experiment; and c) other experiments in spacecraft technology including, a magnetic damper, a solar cell voltage monitor, heat pipes for solar panel thermal equalization, a third harmonic generator similar to that on ATS-3, a solar cell damage experimentoand a"}
