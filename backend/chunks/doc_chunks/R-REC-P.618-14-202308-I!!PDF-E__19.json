The prediction method described in § 2.2.4.1 is the most accurate and is preferred. The simplified prediction method described in § 2.2.4.2 may be used for separation distances less than 20 km; however, it is less accurate. 2.2.4.1 Prediction of outage probability due to rain attenuation with site diversity The diversity prediction method assumes a log -normal distribution of rain intensity and rain attenuation. This method predicts Pr (A1  a1, A2  a2), the joint probability (%) that the attenuation on the path to the first site is greater than a1 and the attenuation on the path to the second site is greater than a2. Pr (A1  a1, A2  a2) is the product of two joint probabilities: 1) Pr, the joint probability that it is raining at both sites; and 2) Pa, the conditional joint probability that the attenuations exceed a1 and a2, respectively, given that it is raining at both sites; i.e.: Pr (A1  a1, A2  a2) = 100  Pr  Pa% (27) These probabilities are: ()1222 2 212 1 2dd 122exp 121 12rrrrr rP RR rr rr          −+ −− −= (28) where: ( ) ( )] 700/ exp[3.0 60/ exp7.02d dr − + − = (29) and ()12 ln ln22 2 212 1 2d 122exp 121 1ln1ln 1 2ln2ln 2b dbb bb bP AA AA ma ma aa aa   − −        −+ −− −= (30) where: ( ) ( )  2500/ exp06.0 30/ exp94.0"}
