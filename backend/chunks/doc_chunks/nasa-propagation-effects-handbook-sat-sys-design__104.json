Theionosphere generally hasasmalleffect on thepropagation ofradio waves inthe10to100GHzrange. Whatever effects doexist (scintillation, absorption, variation intheangle ofarrival, delay, anddepolarization) arise duetotheinteraction oftheradio wave with the free electrons, electron density irregularities andtheearth's magnetic field. Thedensity ofelectrons intheionosphere varies asafunction of geomagnetic latitude, diurnal cycle, yearly cycle, andsolarcycle (among others).Fortunately,most U.S. ground station-satellite paths pass through themidlatitude electron densityregion, which isthemost homogeneous region. This yields only asmall effect onpropagation. Canadian stations maybeaffected bytheauroral region electron densities which arenormally more irregular. Amore complete discussion oftheeffects isincluded inCCIR Volume VI(1978a). Amean verticalone-wayattenuation fortheionosphere at15GHzfor thedaytimeistypically 0.0002 dB(Millman-1958), theamplitude scintillations aregenerally notobservable (Crane-1977) andthetransit time delayincrease overthefree spacepropagationtime delay isoftheorderof1 nanosecond(Klobuchar-lg73). Clearly formost systems operatingabove 10GHz these numbersaresufficiently smallthat othersystem error budgetswill be much larger than theionospheric contributions. Theoneionospheric effect which might influence wide bandwidth systemsoperatingabove 10GHzisphase dispersion. This topic isdiscussed inSection6.8. 6.1.4.2 TroposphericDelays. Highly accurate satellite range, range-rate and position-location systemswill needtoremove thepropagation group delay effects introduced bythetroposphere. Extremely high switching rate TDMA systems mayrequire these corrections inthefuture. Theeffects •arise primarilyduetotheoxygenandwater vapor inthelower troposphere.
