ITU-R P.618 -14 In this prediction method in the frequency band 4 to 6 GHz where path attenuation is low, Ap statistics are not very useful for predicting XPD statistics. For frequencies below 6 GHz, the frequency -scaling formula of § 4.3 can be used to scale cross -polarization statistics calculated for 6 GHz to a lower frequency between 4 and 6 GHz. 4.2 Joint statistics of XPD and attenuation The conditional probability distribution of XPD for a given value of attenuation, Ap, can be modelled by assuming that the cross -polar to co -polar voltage ratio, r = 10–XPD /20, is normally distributed. Parameters of the distribution are the mean value, rm, which is very close to 10–XPDrain/20, with XPD rain given by equation ( 76), and the standard deviation, r, which assumes the almost -constant value of 0.038 for 3 dB  Ap  8 dB. 4.3 Long -term frequency and polarization scaling of statistics of hydrometeor -induced cross -polarization Long -term XPD statistics obtained at one frequency and polarization tilt angle can be scaled to another frequency and polarization tilt angle using the semi -empirical formula:        + + = GHz30 , 4for )4cos1(484.0–1)4cos1(484.0–1log20–21 1 12 2 1 2 ff ff XPD XPD (79) where XPD 1 and XPD 2 are the XPD values not exceeded for the same percentage of time at frequencies f1 and f2 and polarization tilt angles, 1 and 2, respectively. Equation ( 79) is based on the same theoretical formulation as the prediction method of § 4.1, and can be used to scale XPD data that include the effects of both"}
