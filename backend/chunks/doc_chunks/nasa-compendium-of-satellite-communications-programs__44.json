More extensive experiments were made possible with the inclusion of a VHF transponder on the first spin-stabilized ATS spacecraft launched in late 1966. These experiments were extended further when a UHF LES satellite was launched in mid­ 1967, and the second spin-stabilized ATS spacecraft, also including a VHF transponder, was launched in late 1967. The emphasis in the LES experiments was on developing a tactical military capability, while the interest in ATS was in demonstrating position location and communications for application to commercial and private aircraft and ships and to remote data platforms. The experiments performed considerably advanced the state of knowledge of propagation and noise at these frequencies while proving that such systems were feasible. In the LES program, the first experimental tactical terminals designed for specific military applications began to emerge. During this period, the spin-stabilized ATS satellites also demonstrated the feasibility of a signal-processing satellite repeater that provided multiple access through frequency-division multiplexing of independent single sideband uplink signals and down-converting the composite received signal for phase modulation of a single radiated carrier. This system was of interest because it supplied frequency spectrum conservation on the uplink and efficient utilization of available spacecraft power on the downlink. Additionally, a UHF LES satellite demonstrated that an autonomous control ,system could accurately maintain a spin-stabilized spacecraft's spin axis at a 90' orientation relative to the orbital plane. Between late 1968 and early 1971, the areas of concern that existed in the years spanning the mid and late 1960s had to be further expanded to include consideration of higher frequencies for providing the same types of services. Interest beganto develop in employing L-Band frequencies (i. e., a higher portion of the UHF band) for aircraft and maritime position location and communications in the private and commercial 1-20 sectors."}
