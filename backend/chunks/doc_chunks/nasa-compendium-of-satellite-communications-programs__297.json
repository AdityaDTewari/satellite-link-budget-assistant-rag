The arrangements are sketched in Figures 11-9 and 11-10. As of mid-1971, there were approximately 50 Orbita-1 earth terminals. Some of the known Orbita-1 site locations are listed in Table 11-4. More recently, Orbita-2 earth terminals have been installed for operation with the Molniya-2 satellites. Although the Orbita-2 terminal is necessarily designed to operate on different frequencies than those required for the Molniya-1/Orbita-1 com­ bination, it is expected that its basic design and size are comparable to its prede­ cessor. Some of the known Orbita-2 site locations are identified in Table 11-5. By 11-17 0 i M .4k Figure 11-8.
