The IVA design actually reserves four transponders for earth coverage 10-9 service so that only 320 MHz is..reu.ed,, providing a total of 20 transponders,. Two of these earth coverage transponders are to bededicated, in Atlantic service, to tele­ vision and to SPADE, * leaving 18 telephony transponders, pompared with 10 on INTELSAT IV, or a telephony capacity increase of nearly double. This is accom­ plished by the changes indicated in Table 10-5. The INTELSAT program hasbeen a commercial. venture and the number of major innovations in the equipment and techniques pployed has been limited to those required to provide a reliable service. The intent has been to minimize the risk of spacecraft failure, and the exceptional reliability.record amassed by the system testifies to the success of this policy.- Nevertheless, the INTELSAT program has made significant contributions to satellite communications.. Numerous subjective tests with INTELSAT I demonstrated conclusively that the round trip time delay and echo dud totwo-wire user'teminations were-not insur­ mountable-obstacles to the utilization of synchtonous satellites for commercial com­ munications. This was in confirmation of preliminary indications obtained on Project SYNCOM. The 'INTELSAT II spacecraft- demonstrated'that tunnel diode amplifiers of op­ erational reliability were suitable for use as RF receive'preamplifiers. Utilizing these relatively low-noise, high-gain preamplifiers, allowed direct lF to -RF conver- - sion in a single stage to be employed. Sufficieht spacecraft power and high perform­ ance earth terminals allowed these transponders to be designed for linear input/­ output power transfer characteristics. -Additionally, INTELSAT II and an expanded ground -complex demonstrated the fdasibflity of extensive multiple accessing of a single satellite transponder by a group'of opetational ground terminals.- When the wideband INTELSAT III satellites were placed into operation, it was necessary to introduce a third generation of earth"}
