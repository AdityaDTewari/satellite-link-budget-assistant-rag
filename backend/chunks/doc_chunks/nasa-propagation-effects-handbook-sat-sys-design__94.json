Thequantizationis0.5dBforthe10%and90% points andforthemedian. Note that, while these results arestatistical in nature aswell, thequantityconsidered istheinstantaneous attenuation for thetwofrequencies. Itisevident from thefigure that thestatistical relation andthemedian instantaneous relation areessentially identical.i• i i: Thedotted line onFigure 5.4-14 istheline forA2=(f2/f1)2 A1 =2-25AI, where A1istheattenuation indBatfrequency fl=19.04 GHzand A2istheattenuation indBatfrequency f2=28.56 GHz. Therelationships between the.measured attenuations depart from afrequency squared relation particularly athigh attenuation. Astraight line, A2=2.1A1fits thedata closely uptoAI=20dB,butthedata depart from this line atstill higher attenuation. This less than frequency squared attenuation dependence is consistent with thefrequency dependence ofChu's theoretical attenuation coefficients (1974) inthis frequency range. Thefurther decrease infrequency dependence athigher attenuations isconsistent with thesame effect observed in thetheoretical coefficients athigher rain rate since higher attenuation is associated with more intense rain.i InFigure5.4-14, theincrease inthespread between 10%and90%points asattenuation increases isconsistent with constant fractional fluctuation inthe ratio oftheattenuations atthetwofrequencies. 5.5 TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OFFADES Systems maybeable toaccommodate fades during certain months orperiods ofthedaymore readil_ than during other periods. Tohelp assess themagnitude ofthese effects along theeastern U.S. coast, Goldhirsh (1979, 1980) andothers (Rogers andHyde -1979, Brussard -1977) have prepared histograms andcumulative distributions forvarious months andtimes. 180 5.5.1Monthly Distribution ofAttenuation Figure 5.5-1 shows thepercentage oftime foreach month inthe period April 1977 toMarch 1978 that fades of5,15,and25dBwere exceeded. These measurements (Goldhirsh -1979) were made at28.56 GHzfrom theCOMSTAR D2satellite toWallops Island, VAatanelevation angle of41.6 degrees. The fades aremore excessive during thesummer months, except forJuly. This low value forJuly isnotexpected tobeTepresentative forthat month and demonstrates howdatafrom asingle year canmisrepresent thelong-term average value. Weather Bureau data mayalso beutilized toobtain this distribution bymonth, butthis procedure maybeinaccurate because thetype ofrain"}
