Interference aspects are treated in separate Recommendations: – interference between earth stations and terrestrial stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.452); – interference from and to space stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.619); – bidirectional coordination of earth stations (Recommendation ITU -R P.1412). An apparent exception is path depolarization which, although of concern only from the standpoint of interference (e.g. between orthogonally -polarized signal transmissions), is directly related to the propagation impairments of the co -polarized direct signa l. The information is arranged according to the link parameters to be considered in actual system planning, rather than according to the physical phenomena causing the different effects. As far as possible, simple prediction methods covering practical applica tions are provided, along with indications of their range of validity. These relatively simple methods yield satisfactory results in most practical applications, despite the large variability (from year to year and from location to location) of propagation conditions. As far as possible, the prediction methods in this Annex have been tested against measured data from the data banks of Radiocommunication Study Group 3 (see Recommendation ITU-R P.311). 2 Propagation loss The propagation loss on an Earth -space path, relative to the free -space loss, is the sum of different contributions as follows: – attenuation by atmospheric gases; – attenuation by rain, other precipitation and clouds; – focusing and defocusing; – decrease in antenna gain due to wave -front incoherence; – scintillation and multipath effects; – attenuation by sand and dust storms. Each of these contributions has its own characteristics as a function of frequency, geographic location and elevation angle. As a rule, at elevation angles above 10°, only gaseous attenuation, rain and cloud attenuation and possibly scintillation will"}
