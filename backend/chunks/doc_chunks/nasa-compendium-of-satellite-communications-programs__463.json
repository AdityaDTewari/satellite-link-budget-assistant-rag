Block Diagram of SHF Ground Terminal Used With TACSAT I In the SHF receivers, a phase-lock loop was used to keep the ground terminal frequency standard locked to the beacon frequency. Major characteristics of the terminals are shown in Tables 14-8 and 14-9. 14.5 EXPERIMENTS The experiments performed can be grouped under two general types: technical and operational. The technical experiments investigated satellite and ground terminal performance characteristics and system performance characteristics with the Various modems employed singly and under multiple-access conditions. The operational exper­ iments evaluated TACSATCOM performance during armed force operational exercises. In addition, there were various special tests employing TACSAT-1. It was originally intended that technical experiments be performed before opera­ tional experiments but late equipment delivery necessitated that the two types be performed concurrently in some cases. Table 14-10 presents the major technical ex­ periments together with the salient results obtained. The operational experiments, conducted by the Navy, were"}
