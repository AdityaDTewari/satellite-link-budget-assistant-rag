Feb-2013 www.AtlantaRF.com 6 Atlanta RF Services, Software & DesignsLink Budget Objectives Link Budget Analysis: Getting Started 1.The Link Budget allows us to characterize the quality of the wireless communications link in a quantitative fashion . 2.Link Budget is used in the design process to define & “size” parameters and components in the wireless communication system: A.How much RF signal power do I need to transmit/broadcast? B.How big should my antenna be? Or, which antenna should I use? C.How fast can I send data? D.If I use an error detection and correction encoding technique, can I get away with a “noisier” link and therefore save system (& cost) resources elsewhere? 3.Goals in communication systems design: A.To maximize transmission bit rate, Rbit B.To minimize bit error rate, BER. C.To minimize required power, Eb/No. D.To minimize required system bandwidth, Bw. E.To maximize system utilization. F.To minimize systems complexity.

Link Budget Analysis: Getting Started 1.Two link budget analysis need to be planned: A.Uplink Analysis: From ground to satellite. B.Downlink Analysis: From satellite to ground. 2.Two-way communication requires 4 link analysis: A.Example: Maritime communications. 3.One way communication require 2 link analysis: A.Example: Direct -To-Home TV broadcast. 4.Two communication links often operate at different frequencies within the same frequency band. 5.Two links may not be in the same frequency band. A.Fixed / broadcast satellite services usually use same frequency band, like C -band or Ku -band. B.Mobile satellite services may use different frequency bands, like: L -band uplink & S -band downlink. 6.In some communication systems, satellite links may be combined with terrestrial returns.One way communication Two way communication Feb-2013 www.AtlantaRF.com 8 Atlanta RF Services, Software &"}
