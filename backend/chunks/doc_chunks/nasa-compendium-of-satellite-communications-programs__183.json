Both the voice-excited vocoder mode using remote speakers connected to the terminal through the commercial switched telephone network and the pitch-excited vocoder mode using local speakers displayed satisfactory operation. In both modes, familiar speakers could easily be detected. The frequency hopping, MFSK, and convolution enc6der-sequential decoder combined signal processing system displayed (18)a threshold in close agreement with the 6 dB E /N expected . Theory and-b opractice were in almost perfect agreement when 0.3 dB of loss due to non-ideal matched filters and another 0. 3 dB of loss due to non-ideal pulsed signals (i. e., the switching time of the frequency synthesizer was 2-4 gs) were taken into considera­ ('7)tion. The one-way delay induced by the sequential decoder was about 200 ls The satellite X-band transponder received considerable operational evaluation on LES-2 and LES-4. Satellite EIRP, receiver noise figure, bandwidth, frequency stability, and beacon performance were all monitored and found to be the same as 9-17 measured during prelaunch checkouts (1 9 ) . LES-1's transponder was operated for a short time until the satellite assumed its tumbling mode and the transponder performed (1 6 ) as expected The satellite system performance tests and their results are summarized in Table 9-9 (9) (11) (16) (19) (20) These tests were-conducted with LES-2 arid LES-4. Specific repults mentioned in the table are for operation with LES-2. 9.2.6 Operational Results Since these were experimental satellites, no operational traffic was carried., The general performance of all spacecraft was good and in agreement with expecta­ tions. The solar array output on LES-1 had degraded significantly by September of 1965 due to the satellite being left in a circular orbit within the Van Allen Belt(19) With LES-2 being in an elliptical orbit having an apogee out of"}
