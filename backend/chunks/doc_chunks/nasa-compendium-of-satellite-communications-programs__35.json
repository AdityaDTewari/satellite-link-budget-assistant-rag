To resolve the orbit selection issue, low, medium and synchronous altitudes had to be considered, as did orbit in­ clination and degree of ellipticity. Frequencies appropriate for consideration were determined to be in the band from 1 to 10 GHz. Ground terminal technology of parti­ cular interest included low noise receive systems, demodulator thresholds allowing detection down to low values of signal-to-noise ratio, accurate satellite tracking so that high gain antennas could be employed, and high reliability operational performance. Outside of these areas the programs of the early 1960s (including Echo, Courier, West Ford, Telstar, and Relay) employed similar technology that was well within the state-of-the-art at that time. Briefly, the active satellites provided almost omni­ directional antennas with essentially zero gain, low transmitter output power, no stabilization or spin stabilization relative to the sun, and solar cell arrays encircling the outside of the spacecraft to generate prime power. The ground terminals supplied large parabolic reflector or horn antennas, high power klystron or TWT transmitters, and fixed installations.' Modulation was conventional analog frequency modulation and multiple access was by frequency division when employed. The active satellites were, 1-13 in general, expected to support no more than two simultaneous accesses. Communi­ cation services handled included analog voice, TTY, low resolution facsimile, and television. By late 1963, with the aid of data from these initial programs, the questions of type of satellite, frequency band, and ground terminal technology had been resolved. Relay and Telstar had proven that reliable active real time repeaters were feasible and they had become the preferred choice. These repeaters were of the double conversion type with either hard limiting or AGC to ensure a constant input to the output power amplifier operating near saturation. Active repeaters were preferred over the passive systems of"}
