When the spot beams of this satellite are employed witlh high performance ground terminals, a bandwidth limited system results. The INTELSAT IV satellites' communications subsystem consists of global receive and both global and spot beam transmit antennas connected to a 12-channel repeater that provides high power ampli­ fication for each channel individually. Each of these 12 channels ,has a bandwidth approaching 40 MHz, thereby providing capacity for about 500 communications circuits. The satellite has the capability, using the EC antenna, for relaying 6000 half duplex telephone calls, or 12 color television programs, or any equivalent combination of such transmissions. The communication systern of INTELSAT IV is depicted in the block diagram of Figure 10-4. Communications characteristics of the satellite are summarized in Table 10-16. The spot beam transmit antennas represent the most significant departure from the previous satellite designs of the INTELSAT series. Two of these antennas, each a parabolic disc of 127-cm (50-inch) diameter, are mounted on the despun control mast of the satellite. The entire RF portion of the spacecraft is despun. Pointing of the spot beams is prefixed on the ground. These high gain antennas with beamwidths of about 4 degrees, can be used to provide spot coverage in Europe and North and South America, or they can be employed to provide intracontinental coverage within specific countries. The basic physical configuration of the INTELSAT IV spacecraft is depicted in Figure 10-5. As discussed earlier, the \"half-generation\" INTELSAT IVA system, for imple­ mentation in 1975, is aimed at better utilization of available bandwidth by reuse of the baseband. A sophisticated antenna design produces antenna beams which cover the INTELSAT Atlantic basin earth stations with sidelobes sufficiently suppressed to provide for minimal interference between beams using the same frequencies.
