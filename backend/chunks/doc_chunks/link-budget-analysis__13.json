B.Amplitude/envelop/gain/power attenuation. 2.Signal Distortion : A.Distortion can be introduced within the Transmitter, Receiver or in the channel. B.The common types of link distortion are: 1)Frequency -dependent phase shift. 2)Gain variation with frequency caused by channel filtering effects. 3)Gain variation with time as seen in radio/infrared channels. 4)Frequency offsets between Tx& Rx due to Doppler shift or local oscillator errors. C.Distortion can be corrected with equalization or gain/frequency control systems. 3.Signal Interference : A.Interference arises due to signal contamination in the channel by extraneous signals. Most interference signals are impulsive. 4.Noise : A.Noise is characterized as random, unpredictable electrical signals from natural sources such as: Atmospheric noise, Thermal noise, Shot noise, etc. B.Because of the multiplicity of noise sources, it is difficult to define. C.It is commonly assumed that noise in communication links fall into the class of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN).
