In an undeployed configuration the CTS is basically four sided with a low profile and large di­ ameter to present a favorable moment of inertia ratio for stable spin during the transfer orbit.( 1) The structural design emphasizes readily removable components to facilitate the integration of units or subsystems. The core of the design is a central thrust tube to which are mounted the apogee motor and the"}
