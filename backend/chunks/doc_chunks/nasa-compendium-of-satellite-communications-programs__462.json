The satellite UHF receiver processed the received RF signal, which varied in level from -150 to -105 dBW. The signal was split into two channels, one for narrow­ band and the other for wideband operation. The wideband channel was downconverted to a band around 92.5 MHz, hard-limited and cross-coupled to the SHF transmitter. The narrow-band channel was downcon­ verted to a band around 16. 6 MHz, hard-limited and then coupled to the various filters. A ground commandable mode selection switch routed the desired channel output to the UHF transmitter. The SHE received signal level varied from -150 to -85 dBW. The signal was downconverted to a band around 92.5 MHz. This signal was split into two paths, one of which was amplified in the 10-MHz channel and limited. The signal in the other path was downconverted to a band around 16. 6 MHz for the SHF narrow-band channel modes. A ground commandable mode selection switch routed the desired channel output to the SHF transmitter. 14.4 EARTH TERMINALS Two families of tactical terminals were developed for use in the two TACSAT frequency bands as listed in Table 14-3. Each family employed considerable common­ ality of equipment with terminal-specific equipment mainly in the categories of antenna, preamplifier, transmitter, and number and types of modems. Figures 14-4 and 14-5 show block diagrams of the UHF and SHF terminals, with all the possible modes of op­ eration in each frequency band included. As discussed previously, the satellite beacons at UHF and SHF were used as fre­ quency references for all ground terminals. In the UHF receivers, the ground terminal reference oscillator was compared to the beacon and adjusted manually once a week. 14-11 FDN FUp FBEACON sR1ITEST - TRANSLATOR DIPLEXER 70 MHz LOW NOISE TATS RCVR MODEM"}
