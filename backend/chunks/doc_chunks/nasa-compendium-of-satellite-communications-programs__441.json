This energy will be transmitted through a one-way thermal diode-(heat pipe) to the equipment package, which houses a heat reservoir consisting of a container of' paraffin. Once the paraffin melts at 2950 K (720 F), the excessive heat reaching it will be transmitted via a feedback-controlled, variable-conductance heat pipe to a space radiator located on the east side of the EVM. The rate of heat removal is controlled electronically by the reservoir tempera­ hure, hence the term \"feedback control.\" When the spacebraft is in earth's shadow, the'heat contained in the reservoir will maintain the temperature of the simulated equipmentt package within the proper temper­ ature range.

Kirkpatrick, NASA/Ames Research Center. 13.4.5.16.4, Environmental Measurements Experiments -(EME) The EME package consists of eight experiments carried on top of the ATS-6 to view deep space. Primary purpose of the EME is to collect information on the spacecraft 13-126 environment at the synchronous altitude as well as on electromagnetic-ionospheric in­ teractions. The EME experiments are: - The Low Energy Proton-Electron experiment is designed to study intensity -time fluctuations of low-energy electrons and protons impacting the geo­ stationary orbit. * The Low Energy Protons experiment is designed to-determine where in local time protons are injected into the magnetosphere, andhow. closely in time such injections are associated with auroral substorms. * The Solar Cosmic Ray experiment is designed to study solar cosmic rays, their entry and propagation in the magnetosphere and to measure param­ eters of trapped electrons. 0. The Auroral Particles experiment is designed to correlate studies& be­ tween particle fluxes and the visible aurora to determine- the nature of the accelerating mechanism in the magnetosphere. * The Particle Acceleration Measurement experiment will investigate the origin of"}
