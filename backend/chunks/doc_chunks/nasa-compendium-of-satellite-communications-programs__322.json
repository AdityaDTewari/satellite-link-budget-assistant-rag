However, oscillations in pitch, roll, and yaw varied widely and only once in 17 satellite passes during 1967 were the oscillations damped to the level predicted by theory and required for a communication satellite. Also a number of times the satellite has resumed tumbling and has had to be restabiized. Causes have not been determined for all these tumbling occurrences priority military voice channels for a 10-day period while the commercial Trans Pac submarine cable was broken east of the Philippines. Another submarine cable failure between Thailand and RVN in October 1967 was temporarily covered by the TDCSP. Since the first satellite launch in June 1966, the satellites have performed better than expected. The major cause of failure has been the failure to turn on again after coming out of eclipse; and in some cases such failed satellites have turned on after subsequent eclipses. The next most frequent problem has been failure of the automatic TWT switching system resulting in switched TWTs before they have actually failed. As of mid-1971 valid TWT switching had been experienced on three satellites as a result of failures. However, switching had also occurred on three other satel­ lites for no known reason. The major failure experienced with the ground terminals was-with the mainte­ nance of the cryogenic cooling system in the AN/MSC-46 terminals. These were to be field-maintainable, but had-to be returned to the manufacturer for maintenance. The problem was subsequently fixed by modification. Another problem area was an oversensitive tracking system due to its design to track polar orbiting satellites. A modification narrowing the tracking bandwidth solved this problem. For the AN/ MSC-46 terminals the MTTF experienced was about 75 hours. For AN/TSC-54 ter­ minals it was about 300 hours. 12-29 CITED REFERENCES 1. J. W. Johnston,"}
