Organization Bell Canada/Telesat Bell Northern Research Queen Charlotte Islands General Hospital Alberta Native Corn- munications Society (ANCS) CTS Experiments (8 of 8) Country Canada Canada Canada Canada NOTE: The Canadian Experiment data was furnished by Ms. Obj ective The transmission capabilities, station portability, reliability and maintainability of the two-way voice terminals will be investigated by conducting ex­ periments using a terminal at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island. Technical aspects of the transmission of corn­ mercial color TV signals in digital format at a bit rate of approximately 45 mbit/sec will be investigated. This experiment will determine the optimum use of two-way television in providing for operation and management of a primary health delivery system in a remote rural area by performing remote diagnosis, training and ondhe-job super­ vision of medical and paramedical personnel. Interactive communications will be evaluated between remote native communities in social de­ velopment, education/training, health/medical, legal and cultural/entertainment fields.
