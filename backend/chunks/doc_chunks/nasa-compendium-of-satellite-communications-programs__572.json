This type of interference is due primarily to energy spreading of the TDMA signal caused by satellite TWT nonlinearities, and post TWT filters. In this case, Telesat was concerned with the interference level in an analog FM channel since the two neighboring transponders have been assigned to this type of traffic. Experiments were conducted at the Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles in November 1972 to investigate the effects of adjacent channel interference. Results indicated that the ANIK transponder could support a bit rate of 61 Mb/s without causing any noticeable 18-50 ,' \\.-. ',.HARRIETSFIELE) .. Figure 18-27.

A similar experiment was repeated in February 1973 at the Allan Park Earth Station in a more realistic environment (i. e., including the transmit and receive chain, and the satellite in orbit) and results con­ firmed the laboratory measurements. As to the TDMA in-band digital performance, experiments were carried out at Allan Park in March 1973. It was found that the bit error rate performance of the proposed TDMA link at 61 Mb/s was practically achiev­ able A Link Budget for this TDMA system is presented in Table 18-6. This table shows that the link will meet the specified noise performance of 1000 pWpO with an ex­ cess operating margin in the order of 2. 7 dB. The implementation plan will include a three-to-six-month field trial period prior to the actual cutover of the TDMA services. This field trial will provide not only the system operating experience but also an opportunity to verify the results of previous 2) TDMA experiments.("}
