Again theusers typically gotosatellite service providers toobtain thelinks they need.Also,asintheanalog case, once thelinks areestablished, they arededicated full time totheusers. With communication satellites incorporating more ofthenetwork switching functions and thus more users accessing thenetwork onademand assignment multiple access (DAMA) basis,link budget calculations nolonger fully specify system performance. Users are becoming concerned with parameters such as access anddisengagement time andblocking probability. Thetransmission link isalso more dynamic inthese type Csatellites, with forward error-control coding andreduced transmission rates \"switched in\"during rain fades. Quantifying theperformance ofthese advanced type Csatellites canbecome anarduous task. However, ifoneviews these satellite systems asthedigital communication networks they arebecoming, thetask isquite manageable. This isbecause oftwo standards approved bythe American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American National Standards (ANS) X3.]02 andANSX3.141, for specifying and measuring data communication system performance with user- oriented performance parameters. These standards define parameters and measurement methods forquantifying data communication system performance from theuser's point ofview, independent ofsystem design and implementation. ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 provide thedata communication system user a\"common yardstick\" forcomparing howwe_l dissimilar systems--satellite, optical fiber, microwave, orany other transmission media and switching systems--meet their needs. ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 canbeused tohelp identify what each system does best. And theuser does notneed toknow how thesystem isdesigned or implemented. From theservice provider°s point ofview, ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 offer aconvenient means forcomparing their service against acompetitor's. These standards can also beused totrack system degradations n'_d help identify potential bottlenecks. They areused toaugment thelink budget andcapacity calculations forfully describing thesystem performance. 1.3 Purpose andScope ofReport This report focuses on communication satellite system performance measurements and specifications.
