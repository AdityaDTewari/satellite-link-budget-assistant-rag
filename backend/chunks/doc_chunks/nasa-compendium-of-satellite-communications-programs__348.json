(7)(14) Perfdrmance was compared with standarls given by the CCIR and EIA recommendation TR-141 and found.to be,. in general, compatible with the high quality expected for long'haul telephony. With 1200-channel loading, compandors would be required to meet S/N ratio requirements. Flzeq uency instahbilities were, in this case, almost entirely due to differential doppler but were not significant. An AFC loop was not required. For the television'tests, major system design characteristics -were as indicated in Table 13-15. (7)(14) Monochrome TV test terminals were installed at-all three ATS earth stations and color test facilities were available \"atR6sman. Experiments conducted.and their basic results are described in Table 13-16. In addition to these tests, numerous demonstrations have been conducted and events of interest televised. Included were the \"Our World\" demonstration in June.1967, the address by Japanese Prime Minister Sato during his Australian visit in October 1967, and coverage of the 'Olympics in Mexico City in 1968. Investigations of transmission phenomena included measurements of spacecraft spin modulation, transmit and receive antenna patterns, and repeater saturation characteristics plus ground terminal G/T, antenna pointing accuracy, and transmit and receive antenna patterns. Results were in general agreement with previous independent measurements and theoretical expectations. Investigations of polari-\" zation phenomena included evaluations of SHIF Faraday rotation as projected from VH1F measurements and the effect of satellite antenna beam position on observed polarizationi at the ground. The latter determined that the ATS-1 polarization angles (polang) changes about 0.110 per degree change in'satellite beam position while the 4° ATS-3 polang is constant to approximately from peak of beam. Additionally, numerous special tests were performed by NASA ground terminal engineers and the Japanese and Australian governments. The Japanese tests employed the Kashima ground terminal and"}
