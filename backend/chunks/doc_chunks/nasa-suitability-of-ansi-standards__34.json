The address andcontrol fields ofthepackets form an\"order wire,\" functioning like thecommon channel interoffice signaling systems used bylong-haul carriers. Through theorder wires, theuser's request service, in64kb/s increments, from 64kb/s upto approximately 6.1 Mb/s. Therefore, from the user's per_-ective the ACTS network behaves more like acircuit-switched network then apacket network. Another advanced technology feature ofACTS isthemultibeam communication package (MCP). Multiple small uoverage area (approximately 150kmindiameter) spot and scanning beam antennas with cross polarization areused instead of global orwide area coverage antennas. This allows greater frequency reuse and higher gain antennas onthesatellite. Figure 6illustrates theproposed ACTS coverage area. During each l-ms TDMA frame, all earth stations requiring service are illuminated. Like true DAMA satellite systems, theACTS circuit routing andcoverage area canbeprogramed inreal time toaccommodate changes inuser traffic demands. 3819890109851048 391989010985-049 During each TDMA frame thespot beam (orscanning beam inthescan sector) stops (dwells) oneach area with active earth stations. During thedwell, each earth station transmits and receives itsuser traffic. Onthe terrestrial side, theearth stations receive acontinuous data stream from theusers (upto 6.144 Mb/s or96equivalent 64kb/s voice circuits). Theearth stations buffer and segment this incoming data into 64-bit-long words. These words are packaged into messages. Atapredetermined slot inthe TDMA frame, the messages aretransmitted inaii0Mb/s burst. These bursts arereceived atthe satellite, demodulated and demultiplexed back tothe 64kb/s baseband, and stored intheBBP input memory. During thenext frame, the contents ofthe memory aretransferred through theBBP routing switch totheappropriate BBP output memory. Then during thethird frame, thecontents oftheBBPoutput memory are transmitted inaii0 Mb/s burst inaTDM fashion during the appropriate down link spot dwell. Thus, ittakes three TDMA frames (3ms)for thesignal tobeprocessed through thesatellite. TheACTS system will operate inboth point-to-point andpr_nt-to-multipoint (broadcast) modes.
