Mutual Visibility Duration Versus Longitude of the Ascending Node graph indicates that the optimum right ascension is approximately 200W (3400E) longi­ tude, which provides 10.5 hours of continuous coverage from a single satellite. Ifthree Molniya communication satellites are launched at regular intervals into identical elliptical orbits-whose planes are shifted relative to one another by 1200, they will form a system that ensures 24 hour-per-day communications for the entire USSR. It should be noted that this orbit also affords the possibility of continuous communication between the European USSR and North and Central America, thereby establishing communications between most parts of the northern hemisphere, where 75 to 80 percent of the earth's population resides. It should be noted that an elliptical orbit offers an additional important advan­ tage for the Soviet Union. For a launch vehicle of given thrust operating from the appropriate Soviet launch site, two or three times more weight can be placed into the selected elliptical orbit than into an equatorial synchronous one. The Molniya program has been responsible for a number of other innovations in satellite communications technology. Major advances demonstrated by the Molniya-1 satellites are: flywheel stabilization, solar panels that were continually maintained in a 900 aspect relative to the sun line by proper positioning of the body of the space­ craft, and parabolic antennas that tracked the earth independent of the main body of the satellite. This program also produced the first system supplying a regular space television distribution service to a large number of receiving terminals which were widely dispersed geographically. 11.1.1 Hotline -Direct Communications Link Between Washington and Moscow \"The U.
