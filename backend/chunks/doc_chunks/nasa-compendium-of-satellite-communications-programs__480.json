Table 15-2(2)(4 9) is a summary of.the ter-' minals participating in the SKYNET Program. The operational aims are to provide long distance strategic point-to-point digital communications and to meet selected tactical communication needs with the mobile terminals. The central requirement of the system is for multiple access. It was deemed essential that any stationary terminal to be able to communicate with any other, sub­ ject to the limitation of satellite effective radiated power and the amount of terminal 15-2 Table 15-1.
