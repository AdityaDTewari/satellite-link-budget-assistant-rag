The first subsection starts by briefly discussing the conventional ]ink budget calculation method of specifying type AandBcommunication satellite system performance, followed by adiscussion ofthe use ofANS X3.102 for quantifying the end-to-end performance ofdigital links over these same satellites. Thesecond subsection discusses theuseofANSX3.102 forquantifying theend-to-e..d communication system performance oftime-division multiple-access (TDMA), satellite-switched time-division multiple-access (SS/TDMA), (type C), and demand-assignment multiple-access (DAMA) communication satellites. Thethird subsection briefly discusses future satellite-augmented ISDN systems andhow ANS X3.102 canbe u_ed toquantify their end-to-end communication system performance. 3.1 Analog andDigital Link Parameters The classes ofcommunication satellites considered inthis subsection are primarily type Aaud type Bsystems asdefined inSection I. These systems 221989010985-032 provide simple dedicated point-to-point analog service, dedicated point-to- point digital service, and analog and digital broadcastservice. Inallof these systems, the satellite serves asanonregenerative analog repeater. Since none ofthese systems include any switching ordynamic link control functions, communication system performance issimply equal totransmission link performance. 3.1.i TheLink Budget Thetwo-step process oflink budget andsystem capacity calculation isthe usual method for quantifying communication satellite link performance. The link budget calculation gives the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) for analog systems, andthebitenergy-to noise density ratio (Eb/No) fordigital transmission systems. The system capacity calculation gives the number of voice circuits orvideo channel= ananalog system cansupport andtheuser bit rate adigital system cansu[,port. Theappendix gives adetailed discussion andexample ofthese link budget andcapacity calculations.
