The Klystron power amplifier, exciter and power supplies are mounted in the antenna pedestal base. The parametric amplifier and frequency translators are located directly behind the antenna reflectors. The signal interfaces of the antenna mounted electronics are at 400 MHz. Figure 12-11 is a simplified functional diagram of the AN/TSC-54. The AN/TSC-54 is equipped with FM and PN modulation equipment. The FM receiver is a phase-lock demodulator with selectable bandwidths (by switch) and additional bandwidths are selectable by module change. The FM modulator provides for the following modes of operation: a. One voice plus one duplex out-of-band user, TTY and one out-of­ band orderwire TTY. 12-24 0 I.-I W (4 TENNAVI ULTIPLEXERI ~~~MODULATOR RCIE Z, AEfL |POSITIONINGSANE SCIRCUITRY L.

Prime electrical power is supplied by a light-weight 45-kW, 400-Hz diesel generator set. The electrical specifications for prime power are: 120/ 208 V ± 5 percent, 400 Hz t: 2 percent, 3-phase, 4-wire. 12.5 EXPERIIENTS The primary objective of the Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (IDCSP) was to support developments in military satellite communications and provide a limited operational capability. The experiments and,development testing that had been performed through mid-1971 are summarized in Table 12-8. Although the DSCS Phase I was designed as an R&D satellite system it became almost immediately an operational one. Soon after -the first launch a two channel full duplex link capability between two AN/MSC-46 terminals was demonstrated. In July 1967 the Pacific network was placed in operational status, marking the beginning of DSCS integration into the DCS. 12.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The IDCSP has become an operational long-haul satellite comtmunications sys­ tem.
