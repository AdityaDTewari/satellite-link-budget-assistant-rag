This allowed use of FM channels one through seven. Twelve low data rate 14-19 TATS at 18 dBW per access, two high data rate TATS at 29 dBW per access, and three FM'accesses at 31 dBW per access were used. Results showed a C/kT of 59 dB for the FM accesses and a test tone plus noise-to-noise ratio of 26 dB. Members of the Avionics Laboratory of the ECOM conducted digital data trans­ mission, tests with TACSAT, using the TATS modem and the UHF-equipped helicopter. The purpose was to determine the effects of the helicopter environment on the capability of the TACSAT 1 system to relay digital data that could be extrapolated to simulate air traffic control data. The power level was varied in steps and the digital error rates recorded. Air­ craft engines and rotor and aircraft heading all affected the error rate versus power level. However, the results showed that with sufficiently high transmitted power levels no errors occurred. A series of tests using the USS Independence and NELC successfully demonstrated the feasibility of establishing automatic digital data links between remotely located par­ ticipants. The technical feasibility of transferring real-time ASW operational display data to and from a computer-equipped P-3 aircraft and a ground-based computer terminal was demonstrated. The experiment was performed at UHF, and the modulation was 2400-bps because the TATS modems were unavailable. A two-way UHF-TDM communication mode used for air traffic control and car­ rier landing operated successfully through the TACSAT 1 repeater. Vocoder voice word intelligibility experiments using the TATS modem were conducted using TACSAT 1. The word intelligibility versus c/N values reached a maximum of 80 percent in some tests and 90 percent using other terminals. Experiments were performed to determine degree of improved traffic flow in a starnet using automatic control."}
