Particular emphasis is placed on program results, including experiments conducted, communications system operational performance, and technology employed. The background for understanding these results is established through brief summaries of the program organization, system configuration, and satellite and ground terminal characteristics. Major consideration is given to the communications system aspects of each program, but general spacecraft technology and other experiments conducted as part of the same program are, for the most part, at least mentioned summarily. Each program review attempts to be thorough and objective to the maximum extent possible from publicly available literature. In some cases, such literature was not adequate to allow complete reporting to the level of descriptive detail desired. This is particularly true for programs involving foreign, international, or military sponsorship. Program difficulties encountered are viewed as positive contributions towards advancing the state-of-the-art in satellite communications and are presented in that light. The project reviews presented include all significant past programs in which satellites having some operational capability were successfully launched into orbit and all active programs, as of mid-1974, wherein development and procurement of the necessary space hardware had been approved. Soite of the programs described span a considerable period of time and present an evolutionary development of several con­ figurations of ground and space assets. In most such cases, separate discussions of the different segments of the program, each segment of which may encompass several spacecraft, are provided. The approach to program segmentation has, in all cases, been guided by the results-oriented objective of this document. The organizational grouping this provides may not in all cases coincide exactly with the chronological 1-1 sequence of events or the official program organization based on administrative con­ siderations and initially expected results.
