Receive channels tracking error and telemetry signals Each of these facilities is equipped with a 30-meter (98-foot) diameter antenna, O which in conjunction with a parametric amplifier provides a minimum G/T of 37 dB. These antennas incorporate a wheel-and-track type of mount to provide rotation in azi­ muth, and contain a simplified tracking system operating on the principle of maximizing the received signal as the antenna is moved through a series of discrete steps under the command of an antenna control unit. An elevated equipment room mounted near the antenna elevation axis houses most of the transmitting equipment, as well as the re­ ceiver low-noise parametric amplifiers. The antennas are also provided with auto­ matically controlled electrical de-icing. Each station is equipped to transmit and receive on several RF channels, with Allan Park having seven transmit chains each capable of producing an EIRP of 84 dBW, and eight receive chains, while Lake Cowichan has two transmit chains and five receive chains. Hot standby transmit and receive chains are provided which switch into service automatically in the event of failure of the operating equipment. Power for these stations, from commercial sources, is provided through an un- S interrupted power supply incorporating a rotary converter, a battery bank with a 15-minute reserve capacity, and a diesel generator which starts automatically if the commercial primary power fails. The primary power equipment, the control consoles and the major portions of the receiving equipment are housed in a building connected to the antenna through a covered passageway. The"}
