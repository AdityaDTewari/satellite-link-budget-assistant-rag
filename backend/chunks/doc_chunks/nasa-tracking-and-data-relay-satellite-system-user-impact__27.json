The experimental approach involves the fabrication of various spacecraft structures and testing them in conjunction with different antenna configura- tions. A similar, however, for the same cost, more complete evaluation could be conducted analytically. A hybrid approach using methods in unison produces the best results when applied during the actual hardware development stage after which the antenna selection has already been completed. During this stage the numerical analysis could be used to provide initial insight with final design being verified by experiment. 4-10 Of the three methods of studying the spacecraft antenna interaction problem, it is believed the analytical approach is by far the most promising. It gives the capability by which a more complete set of parametric data can be derived; it lends itself more readily to changes, and it is particularly useful to assessing performance effects which are subject to design perturbations. The available numerical techniques for analysis of structural inter- ferences on antenna radiation characteristics can be divided into three different formulation methods. These methods are the most important ones available to date and utilize the following techniques: a) Electromagnetic integral equation formulation b) Wire-grid modeling c) Geometrical diffraction theory Each method has its range of applicability, accuracy and complexity. The geometrical theory of diffraction(7 8, 9) is best suited for the analysis of scattering problems where the interfering structures are large compared to a wavelength. Generally speaking the larger the struc- ture the better the accuracy of the model. The technique is analogous conceptually to that of ray tracing. The wire-grid modeling technique(10' 11) is based on the premise that a solid conducting body may be substituted by a grid of thin wires con- figured to correspond to"}
