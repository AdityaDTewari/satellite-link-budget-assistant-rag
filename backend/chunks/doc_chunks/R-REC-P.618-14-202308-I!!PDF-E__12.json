Typically, the frequency of the predicted propagation effect is higher than the frequency of the known propagation effect. The ratio between the rain attenuation at the two frequencies can vary during a rain event, and the variability of the ratio generally increases as the rain attenuation increases. 1 𝑐𝐵is the same bivariate normal integral used in § 2.2.4.1. An approximation to this integral is available in Z. Drezner and G.O. Wesolowsky. “On the Computation of the Bivariate Normal Integral ”, Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation. Vol. 35, 1989, pp. 101 -107. The Matlab statistics toolbox contains the built -in Matlab function ‘ mvncdf ’ that computes the bivariate normal integral, and the Python library contains the built -in function ‘mvndst’ that computes the bivariate normal integral. 10 Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 Two prediction methods are provided in the following paragraphs: 1) Section 2.2.1.3.1 provides a method of predicting the statistical variation of the rain attenuation at frequency f2 conditioned on the rain attenuation at frequency f1. This method requires the cumulative distributions of rain attenuation at both frequencies. 2) Section 2.2.1.3.2 provides a simplified method of predicting the equiprobable rain attenuation at frequency f2 conditioned on the rain attenuation at frequency f1. This method does not require the cumulative distribution of the rain attenuation at either frequency. These prediction methods may be applicable to uplink power control and adaptive coding and modulation, for example: a) The first method predicts the instantaneous uplink rain attenuation at frequency f2 based on the measured"}
