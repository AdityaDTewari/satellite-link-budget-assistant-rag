INTRODUCTION Ithasbeen argued that communication satellites arelosing their monopoly inthe long-haul transmission market (Byrne, 1985). With the day-by-day increase inoptical fiber cable miles and long-haul communication providers such asSprint touting the advantages ofoptical fiber communicatio_s, the communication satellite industry future does indeed seem dim. }{owever, one must remember that the imminent demise ofterrestrial m_crowave systems _a_ incorrectly predicted with theadvent ofcommunication satellites. Today, both communication satellites and terrestrial microwave systems coexist inahighly competitive market. Although, theimmediate competitive threat imposed byfiber istotheterrestrial microwave systems, this does not imply tha\" thecommunication satellite industry andservice-providers need do nothing toenhance their product° Toremain aviable andprofitable industry, communication satellites will need toevolve beyond therole ofsimple, loug- haul transmission links. They will need tobecome anintegral part ofdata communication networks such asanIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). *The author iswith the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, National Telecommunications andInformation Administration, U.S. Department ofCommerce, Boulder, CO80303-3328. ! _a • r_:._._r_!_,_ ,_,_.__..,..___. _........... _............,,_.,,_,_._._._ ,._,.._._,.._..,_ _..::,_:._........._..___•_._ _,_o._,_,_ _,_ _,__.;__..__._,•__,_.,_.._,_ __._. ..... _ i\" Commensurate with this evolution, theways bywhich communication satell_te sv':tem performance ismeasured andspecified needs tobereevaluated. 1.1 Evolution oftheCommunication Satellite andItsRole Lovell andCuccia (1984) ofNASA have classified communication satellites into thre_ categories: i.Type Asatellites carrying one ormore simple transponders and earth-coverage antenna. 2.Type Bsatellites carrying multiple fixed antennas and multiple transponders, where under ground control the in_erconnectivity ; between thebeams andtransponders canberearranged. ! 3.Type Csatellites similar totype Bbutwith onboard message- i; J switching capabilities. _i The transponders forboth type Aandtype Bsatellites areanalog a'._dsupport i single ormultiple communication channels.
