The adequacy ofthis simple approximation issupportedbytherain rate andrain attenuation datameasured onnine, ll-GHz, terrestrial radio paths atfive U.S. locations (Lin-1977). 3.5.3 Earth-Satellite Path Length Toextend themethod toearth-satellite paths, letHbethelong-term average height ofthefreezing level intheatmosphere, measured relative to sealevel. Theeffective average length oftheearth-satellite path affected byrain isthene L=(H-Hg)Isin e (3.5-5) where Bisthesatelliteelevation angle asviewed from theearth station, and Hgistheground elevation measured from thesealevel. Theradar measurements ofrainfall reflectivity atWallops Island, Virginia indicate that ontheaverage rainy day(CCIR-lg77) H:4km (3.5-6) 85 Thus, given theelevation angle 6,theground elevation Hgandthe distribution of5-minute point rain rates, wecancalculate therain attenuation distribution ontheearth-satellite path through theuseof equations 3.5-l, 2and5. Notice that equation3.5-5implies that thepath rain attenuation B (R,L) varies exactly asthecosecant oftheelevation angle ewith this simple extension oftheterrestrial model. Also note that these simpleformulas are valid onlyonthelongterm average. Theshort term relationships between the surface point rain rate andtheearth-satellite path rain attenuation, ona storm-by-stOrm basis, have been observed tobeerratic anddifficultto predict. 3.6 PIECEWISE UNIFORM RAIN RATE MODEL Aquasi-physical model ofreal rains hasbeen developed atthe Virginia Polytechnic Institute andState University (Persinger, etal-1980) to eliminate theneed foreffective path lengths. Themodel accounts forthe nonuniform spatial rain rate distributionandpermits direct evaluation ofthe effective path length integral, A=f_dl, foranarbitrary propagation path. The.piecewise uniform rain rate model isbased onthefollowing two simplifying assumptions: a)thespatialrain rate distributionisuniform for lowrain rates, andb)aspeak rain rate increases, therain rate distribution R(1)becomes increasingly nonuniform. Themodel utilizes aneffective rain extent wherein therain isof height H(above aflat earth) andofbasal length B(inaplane containing the line-of-sightpath andthelocal vertical attheearth terminal location). Therain height values follow from theO°Cisotherm heights (CCIR-1978a, Doc. F5/003). ForsimplicitytheU.S. will bedivided into three latitude classes yielding 86!/ 3.5kmHigh-latitude (above40°) 4.0kmMid-latitude 4.5kmLow-latitude (below33°)(3.6-I) Confidence inthese values canbegained byexamining attenuation datafrom several experiments atdifferent locations, elevation angles, and frequencies."}
