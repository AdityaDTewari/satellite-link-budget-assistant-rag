The ECI terminal was an experimental, off-the-shelf, single channel, low data rate, teletype communication system that employedthe triple frequency diversity ECI modem. The U.S. Navy version of this t6rminal was nicknamed a LODUS terminal. The U. S. Air Force version was designated the UHF terminal (ECI 591). The U. S. Army's Project East equipment included two jeep, two 680-kg (3/4-ton) truck, and one 7.9-meter (26-foot) van terminal. They were assembled from off-the-shelf commer­ cial and military equipment and employed conventional frequency modulation for voice and teletype communicatifo'As. Block diagrams of typical Air Force ECI and Army 680-kg (3/4-ton) truck terminals 'are shown id'Figures 9-7 and 9-8, respectively. With the experiene gaiiied from opeb}tinig these early terminals,, the U. S. Armed Services went on to develop terminals specially designed for operation in, a tactical military communications environment. These terminals eflioyed the TATS modem, developed by Lincoln Laboratories and p'roduced by Syltrknia El'R t6nics' Products Inc-,, as a major mode of communications. They are -described ih th&dis­ cussion of ground terminals emplbygd with TACSAT I (see Section 14.4). Character­ istics of the Lexington fixed terminal and-a.tical C-135 aircraft ECI terminal are delineated in Table 9-16(6) (33)(34)(36)(39). The linear polarization of the blade aircraft antenna resulted in a 3-dB link polarization loss since all of the UHF Lincoln-Experimental Satellites had circularly polarized antennas. The crbssbd dipole and crossed slot aircraft antennas were circularly polarized. 9.3.5 Experiments . . : A multitude of snfall mobile terminals were available"}
