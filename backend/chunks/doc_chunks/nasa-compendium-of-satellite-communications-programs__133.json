Relay I was launched on December 13, 1962, and Relay II on January 21, 1964. The orbital parameters for both spacecraft are shown in Table 7-1. Relay I and II were basically of the same design, although certain modifications were introduced into Relay II based on operating experiences with Relay I. These modifications included the use of n-on-p instead of p-on-n solar cells and changes in the wideband repeater high-power regulator circuitry. The primary earth terminals participating in the Relay Program are listed in Table 7-2. Tracking and telemetry data were provided by the NASA worldwide network of Minitrack stations. 7-1 Table 7-1.

Major difficulties included the power regulator failure on Relay I and a satellite command receiver susceptibility to spurious signals. As a result of the power regulator failure, it was recognized that dew point criteria and leakage tests had to be included in all future power transistor procurement specifications and that equipment should be tested throughout the temperature range, rather than at specific maximum, mini­ mum, and typical values. The command receiver spurious responses resulted in a recommendation that more complex command signals be designed for all future spacecraft. 7.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Relay system consisted of the orbiting satellite, the complex of partici­ pating ground"}
