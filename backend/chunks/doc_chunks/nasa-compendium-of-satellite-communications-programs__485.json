SKYNET I uses UHF unprotected commands. SKYNET II will use a crypto-protected command system compatible with the U. S. Air Force Space Ground Link System (SGLS). Engineering control of the communication system is exercised from the Master Engineering Control Center (MECC) collocated with the Type I earth station at Oakhanger. At this station the status of each earth station in the system is displayed and instructions on power levels, frequencies, and operating modes to be used as well as positional information relating to the spacecraft are broadcast over engineer­ ing orderwire circuits. Traffic control takes place at speech and telegraph facility control centers which are remote from the earth stations and connected to them by telephone lines. 15.3 SPACECRAFT Spacecraft characteristics for the SKYNET-I and -II satellites are displayed in Tables 15-6(2)(3) and 15-7, respectively. Figure 15-3 is a simplified block diagram of the SKYNET-I communications configuration. As shown in Figure 15-3, the SKYNET I communications subsystem receives, translates in frequency, amplifies, and retransmits X-band signals. Two channels, 20- and 2-MHz bandwidth (1 dB), are provided. The total output power is divided equally between the two channels. Figure 15-3 indicates the single thread path. The complete equipment redundancy and cross-strapping that is employed to achieve reliability is not shown. Selection of either set of communications equipment, op­ erating with either traveling wave tube amplifier, is accomplished by ground com­ mand. 15-11 Table 15-6.
