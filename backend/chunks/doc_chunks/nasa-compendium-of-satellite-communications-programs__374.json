The stabilization booms were successfully deployed but the tumbling nature of the satellite resulted in the loss of one boom and in another being broken. Operation of the C-Band transponders was demonstrated including transmissions by the earth terminal at Ahmedabad, India. ATS-4 produced even less in the way of successful results than ATS-2. Among the accomplishments were partial deployment and scissoring of the stabilization booms plus successful firing of the ion engines. Some of the experiments on board ATS-5 were also lost when the .spacecraft was left spinning rather than gravity gradient stabilized. In particular, it was not possible to obtain data from the gravity gradient, resistojet, ion engine, solar cell voltage monitor, heat pipe solar panel temperature equalization, cosmic radio noise, or from the electric field measurements experiments. If the booms could be deployed the latter two could be successfully completed. Noteworthy successes have been obtained from the earth environment measurements,"}
