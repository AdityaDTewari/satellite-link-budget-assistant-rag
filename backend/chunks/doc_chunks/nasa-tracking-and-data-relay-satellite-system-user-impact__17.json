Thus, the lower level of the maximum visibility curve (46%) represents communications with just one TDRS. When the beamwidth is sufficiently large to allow communication with either TDRS at the same place in the user's orbit*, then the upper level of the maximum curve results. For the case of gimballing the user antenna through the angle + the results are presented in Figures 3.8 and 3.9. The curves are similar to those described earlier with two exceptions. First, since a is a function of altitude**, the maximum and minimum visibility times become a function of altitude as well, and the results are shown 0* For a 90 polar orbit this requirement amounts to 0 e 1800 I) TDRS1 XTDRS I 1 2 ** 01 = -sin l()(Figure 3.1). 3-11 3-11 Figure 3.6.
