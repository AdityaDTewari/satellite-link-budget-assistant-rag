Specific refinements to the state-of-the-art, contributed by the ATS-1 and 3 test programs, were'innumerable. There were four contributions of major impor­ tance in satellite communication; two of these were in the area of despun antenna technology. ATS-1 demonstrated the feasibility and potential of electronic-despinning using phased arrays while ATS-3 displayed the feasibility and attractiveness of mechanically-despun antennas. The SHF multiple access experiments showed the possibility of the practical implementation of a system employing single-sideband frequency division multiplexing on the uplink and phase modulation by the composite 13-5 received signal on the downlink. Additionally, the feasibility of VHF communications through a synchronous satellite by small mobile earth terminals was demonstrated. 13.2.2 System Description The SHF tests with ATS-1 involved all of the terminals listed in Table 13-3. Loop back, half duplex, full duplex, and three terminal multiple access test configu­ rations were all employed. For the ATS-3 tests only Rosman and Mojave terminals had satellite visibility. Tests were therefore performed on a loop back, half duplex, and full duplex basis. VHF tests were conducted in all of these configurations from loop back through full duplex linking. Satellite transponder non-linearity, plus power and bandwidth limitations, tended to limit multiple access capabilities. The NASA­ furnished terminals provided two functions"}
