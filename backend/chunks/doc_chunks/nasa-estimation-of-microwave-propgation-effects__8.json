When rainy weatherisexperienced alongthelink, thesystem performance will degrade inways which maybereliably estimated. However, due tothe randomness ofthe events occurring inthe troposphere, only statistical predictions canbeconsidered which factor into system designs. Recent modelling based onaglobal climatology ofrain (Crane, 1977a;Crane, 1979b) has provided ameans ofcoupling the rain statistics with the attenuation theory. These results aredescribed here for thepurpose of system design andprediction rather thanelaborating onthetheoryor background covered inthereferences. Several comparisonswith experi- mental results support themodel (Crane, 1979b) andargue for itsadoption forgeneral application tosystem design. 2.2.1 Model Themodel described isused fortheestimationoftheannual atten- uation distribution tobeexpected onaspecific propagation link. It differs from some ofthemodels currently available inthatitisbased entirely onmeteorological observations, not attenuation measurements. Themodel was tested bycomparison with attenuation measurements. This procedure wasused"}
