This appears tobegenerallytrue, asseeninTables6.4-1and6.4-2,which present measurements from twosources. InTable 6.4-1, thegaseous attenuation, calculated forthemeasured surfacerelative humidity, isgiven forcomparison. Thecloud attenuation is inmost cases 40%orless ofthegaseous attenuation. Forfrequencies removed from the35and95GHz\"windows,\" thecloud attenuation would beasmaller fraction ofgaseous attenuation. InTable 6.4-I,thenumber ofobservations israther small forallbuttwotypes ofclouds. Thenumbers given should therefore notbegiven undue statistical,significance. Also, inusingboth tables, oneshouldbear inmind thegreat variability insizeandstateof development oftheclouds observed. The35and95GHzdataofTable6.4-1or6.4-2mayberoughly scaled infrequency, usingthefrequency dependence ofattenuation coefficient from Figure6.4-I.Scalinginthis manner isquiteapproximate, asisseenfrom Table 6.4-1.Theratio ofattenuation coefficientsat35and95GHzvaries between about 3.9for-80C to6.3for20°C.Theratio ofaverage cloud attenuations measured atthose frequencies is,from thetable, 3.4for stratocumulus, 2.8forcumulus, and6.9forcumulonimbus. Inanother series ofmeasurements onindividual fair weather c_ulus clouds (Lo, etal-1975) this ratio wasusually between 3.7and5.5.. i i 250 Table 6.4-1 Zenith Cloud Attenuation Measurements, From Lo,Fannin andStraiton (lg75) CloudType Altocumulus Altostratus Stratocumulus Stratus Nimbostratus Cumulus CumuionimbusNumber of Observations 7 2 22 8 5 20 6Mean Cloud Attenuation IdB)MeanGaseous Attenuation (dB) 35GHz 95GHz .38 .34 .43 .42 .44 .41 .4035GHz95GHz .02 .23 .15 .30 .18 .61 .13 .12 .14 .11 .12 .34 .34 2.361.93 1.73 2.14 2.14 2.32 2.12 2.07 Table6.4-2 Zenith Cloud Attenuation Measurements, From CCIR(1978, Rpt. 721) Cloud T_,pe Stratocumul us Small, FineWeather Cumulus Large cumulus Cumulonimbus Nimbostratus (Rain Cloud)Cloud Attenuation (dB) 95GHz 0.5-1 0.5 1.5 2-7 2-4150GHz 0.5-1 0.5 2 3-8 5-7 251 Thereappears tobealarge discrepancy between tables 6.4-1 and 6.4-2 intheattenuation ofnimbostratusclouds at95GHz. Thelarge values of Table 6.4-2 maybeduetotheinclusion ofprecipitation inthepath, however, because thepresenceofnimbostratus clouds would usually beaccompanied, sooner orlater, byprecipitationattheground station, thehigher values of .attenuation would beexpected. This does notnecessarilyapply to cumulonimbus clouds, however. Because ofthelarge vertical development and limited horizontal extent ofthese clouds, atypical (30-400 elevation angle) propagationpathmaybeintercepted bythem without significant rainfall attheground station. 6.4.2.3Estimatin 9Cloud Attenuation.
