Therefore, power is a useful parameter for analog communications. 3.With digital communications, symbols are transmitted in a time: TS. If only one symbol is observed, mean power in all the time interval approaches zero. Therefore, power is not a satisfactory parameter for digital systems. 4.In digital communications, more often is used Eb/N0, or normalized version of signal and noise: where: Ebis the energy per bit, watt -second. N0is thermal noise in 1 Hz bandwidth, watts/Hz. R is the data speed in the system, bits per second (bps). Bwis the frequency bandwidth, Hz.

A.BER is directly related to Eb/Noand improves as Eb/Nogets larger. B.Eb= Pr/Rbit= Received power/Bit rate, Watts/bits/sec. Rbit= Bit rate,bps C.No= Noise power per unit of bandwidth = Noise power density, dBW /Hz. 3.S/N or BER is measured at the demodulator’s output, so they are specified at baseband frequencies: A.S/N = 40 dB in television; S/N = 30 dB in analog speech channels. B.S/N = 36 to 40dB for FM television C/N = 8 to 12dB in demodulator’s (modem’s) input. C.BER < 10-6in data channels C/N = 12 dB (QPSK) at demod’s input. 4.S/N and BER depend on C/N and on the modulation technique.
