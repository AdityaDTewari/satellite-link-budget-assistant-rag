Simplified Terminal (Without Frequency Hopping) 9-9 * \" The three alternate information rates provided corresponded, in order of ascending rate, to transmission of two 100-wpm teletype channels, a pitch-excited vocoder output (4. 8 kbps) plus the two teletype channels, or a voice-excited vocoder output (9. 6 kbps) plus two teletype channels, respectively. The two vocoder systems were provided in one unit capable of two modes of operation. Both modes provided a high degree of intelligibility and speaker recognizability. In the pitch-excited mode, a high fidelity input was required as provided by the high quality microphone at the LET terminal. When operated at the higher data rate, the vocoder was used in the voice-excited mode, allowing the use of a degraded input, including a \"phone patch\" connection to the commercial telephone plant. 9.2--3 Spacecraft Characteristics of the communications-related subsystems of the LES-1, 2 & 4 spacecraft are given in Table 9-6(1) (8) (11). The LES-1 and 2 satellites were nearly identical in all respects and the transponder, aboard all three spacecraft, was basically the same. A simplified block diagram of the transponder is shown in Figure 9-2. A 60-MHz IF was employed which made double up conversion necessary to avoid the need for narrow sideband separation filters at the 7. 8-GHz output frequency. LES-1 and 2 were designed to-operate-with-their-spin-axis-normal-to-the-earth­ sun line. As a result, the spacecraft orientation relative to the earth varied making a broad range of coverage by the satellite antenna pattern necessary. This was solv solved through the 8-element switched array of antenna elements arranged"}
