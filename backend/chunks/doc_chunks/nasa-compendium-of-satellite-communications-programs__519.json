All links will be established on a time base (rather than frequency) allowing each terminal to function as a multiple link or nodal terminal. A full complement of modified Phase I and newly procured terminals will be available for use during this stage. Protected traffic will continue to be provided using PN equipment. However, the modems employed will be an advanced model designed to meet the Stage 2 system re­ quirements. Table 17-2 presents a summary of the terminals which will participate in the Phase II DSCS.t 3o 17.3 SPACECRAFT The Phase I DSCS satellite is portrayed in Figure 17-3 and the spacecraft char­ acteristics are displayed in Table 17-3. A block diagram of the communications transponder is found in Figure 17-4. The Phase II satellite transponder consists of a multichannel repeater with the channels cross-linked, a receive and a transmit EC antenna, and two steerable NB antennas, each capable of receiving and transmitting simultaneously. This arrangement will provide four different modes of operation: 1. Earth coverage to earth coverage (EC-EC) 2. Earth coverage to narrow beam (EC-NB) 3. Narrow beam to earth coverage (NB-EC) 4. Narrow beam to narrow beam (NB-NB) The basic interconnection for these four modes is shown in Figure 17-4. 17-7 Table 17-2.
