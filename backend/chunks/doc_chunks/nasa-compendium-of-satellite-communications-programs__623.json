Another essential part of the earth segment is the interconnection links from the earth terminals to the major population centers which they serve and which may be up to a hundred miles or so away. Several microwave repeaters can be involved in this link. As an example, the Western Union interconnection between the Steele Valley earth terminal and the population center of Los Angeles is shown in Figure 20-26. 20.5.5 Operational Results Western Union was the first commercial organization to apply to the FCC for authorization to construct and operate a Domestic satellite system in the United States. In April 1974, Westar I was successfully launched, and commercial service was in­ augurated in July 1974. The Western Union system became the first complete U.S. operating system and currently provides the space segments for all domestic satellite systems. It is multipurpose in that both message and television traffic are carried. 20-48 (1) PROT. -EXIST PRT.- XI POT_-EXS (2) MSG --EXIST MSG.- EXIST MSG.- EXIST (3) MSG. -EXIST MSG. -EXIST MSG.- EXIST (4) VIDEO --EXIST z VIDEO -EXIST < VIDEO -EXIST w 0u £0 2-J 0~0 0 ccw ­ £G0 LGu IGi11Hi1~ EXISTING WESTAR CHANNELS 1.
