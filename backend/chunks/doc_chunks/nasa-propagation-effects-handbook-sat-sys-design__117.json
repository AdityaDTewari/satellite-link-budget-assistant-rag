Distribution extension inthis manner assumes that thevalues ofrain rate andattenuation remain thesame asthemeasured values, ontheaverage, for times oftheyear different than themeasurement period. This isnot necessarilyso. Thephysical distributionofraindrops along thepropagation path inastratiformrain, forexample, differs from thedistribution ina mild convective storm. Both conditions could produce local rainfall atthe same rate, buttheattenuation produced could bequite different. Thus in regions where there iswide seasonalvariation inhowrain falls, distribution extension shouldbeused with caution. Thereliability oftheextended distribution depends onhow\"typical\" ofthewhole year therainfall was during themeasurement period. Iftheshapesofthelimited-time andthe long-term distribution curves aresimilar, thelimited-time sample is statistically significant andthedistributionextension will bevalid. 6.3.4.3FrequencyScaling. Iffrequency scalingofmeasured rain attenuation (Step 3ofFigure6.3-8) isrequired, thespecific attenuation scaling technique isrecommended. Inthis technique thespecific attenuation data (Olsen, Rogers andHodge, 1978) given inFigure6.3-5 andTable 6.3-2 is utilized toscale theattenuation Afrom frequency fltofrequency f2: 231 Referring totheequation forrain attenuation inStep 7ofFigure 6.3-1, the result is whereA2-a2Rpb2-b__a2(forb1_b2) A1al al AI=A(fl) ,A2=A(f2), aI=a(fl), etc. This isafair estimate forsmall frequency ratios (e.g., lessthan 1.5:1), andmoderate Vain rates, buterrors canbelarge otherwise. This isbecause theabove equation implicity assumes that rainfall ishomogeneous over the propagation path, which isusually nottrue. Byassuming asimple Gaussian model fortherain"}
