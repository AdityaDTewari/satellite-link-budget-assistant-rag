Ability to carry simultaneously a large number of circuits between transmitters and receivers located in widely separated geographical regions. 6. Relative ease of operation, since ground antennas are not required to track the satellite relay- medium at high rates over large angles. 7. Relative economy of establishment, since only two successful rocket launches could establish the entire satellite portion of a system to provide the performance indicated. 5-1 The principal advantage of the West Ford concept is its great inherent resistance to any damage (natural or other) that could significantly reduce its capability, so worldwide communications could .be maintained under any foreseeable circumstances. The question of possible interference to radio astronomy, optical astronomy, and space travel was under discussion from the outset of Project West Ford. Because of this concern, an ad hoc committee of the Natioiial'Academy of Sciences was established 4hich subsequently recommended that the project be declassified­ and disclosed to the scientific community at large. Opposition to the West Ford project was especially concerned with leaving material that might prove to be consider­ ably harmful in the above-mentioned respects dispersed in space. Late in September 1961\", a special panel of the President's Sciehce Advisory Committee concluded that \"the United States can proceed with the West Ford commun­ ications experiment without danger to science.\" -As a result, a.satellite carrying the West Ford dipole dispenser package was launched on October 21, 1961. The attempt failed because of a mechanical malfunction in the dispenser. The dipoles did not disperse: fragments of the package were observed in orbit by a VHF radar but they could serve no useful communications function. A year and a half elapsed before a second attempt was made on May 10, 1963. The dipole dispenser was carried into orbit as a"}
