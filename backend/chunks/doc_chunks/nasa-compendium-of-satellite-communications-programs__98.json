However, fades did not correlate with atmospheric disturbances that affect more conventional types of long distance radio propagation such as HF. •* Nulls in pattern from two-element satellite antenna caused error bursts twice per satellite spin cycle due to signal level dropping below threshold. Corrected error counts eliminated these bursts from consideration. •** Synchronization difficulties could be overcome by multiplexing a separate synchronization signal with facsimile signal. However, this resulted in noticeable intermodulation. 4-11 experiment conducted. However, reliabilities of the klystron power amplifiers and low noise parametric amplifier receiver front ends employed were not adequate for an operational system. The major operational. difficulty encountered with the Courier system occurred on October 21, 1960, when the satellite ceased to respond to ground terminal \"turn on\" commands. This left the satellite in an acquisition mode with the UHF communications system and telemetry transmitter deactivated, *and only the VHF beacon transmitter remained active, The exact cause of failure was never determined. Erratic command system in-orbit performance on Courier ,Ib and subsequent life testing of a duplicate satellite model pointed toward a failure of command system circuitry.' The circuitry for cycling the-VHF acquisition receivers \"on\" and\"off\" (I. e., battery saver circuit) was hypothesized as the most likely point of failure. (2) 4-12 CITED REFERENCES 1. P. W.
