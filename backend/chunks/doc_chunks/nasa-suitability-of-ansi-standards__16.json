The inputs totheprocess are the measurcment objectives and the digltal signals observed atthe user/system interfaces. The outputs from theprocess aretheestimated mean values and associated precision andvariability statistics (e.g., confidence limits, histograms, andregression coefficients) oftheperformance parameters selected tocharacterize thesystem (ANSI, 1987). Three measurement objectives aredefined inANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987): I.Absolute Performance Characterization. Establishing the performance baseline ofthesystem. 2.Simple Hypothesis Test. Measuring toseeifthesystem performance iswithin some previously stated bounds. 3.Ana1_J_[s ofFactor Effects. Measuring toseehowdifferent system configurations affect system performance. 161989010985-026 ]71989010985-027 Systemdesigners, service_oviders, andexperimenters are interested inthe first and third objectives for determining the basic systemperformance characteristics. Users areinterested inthesecond objective fordetermining ifthesystemmeets their performance requirements. Asshown inFigure 3,themeasurement process iscarried outinfour steps: I.Experiment Design. Adetailed experiment plan isdeveloped from the desired measurement objectives. Thespecific performance information tobecollected isidentified and individual test conditions set. 2.Data Extraction. Selected pairs ofdigital user/systeminterfaces aremonitored inreal time.Achronological event history ofthe nature and time relevant interface events occur isrecorded. (Table 3lists tile generic ANS X3.141 reference events that correlate tothese system-specific reference events.) 3.Data Reduction. Estimated values ofthe selected performance parameters aregenerated from theevent histories recorded during thedata extraction step. 4.Data Analysis. The precision andvariability ofthe individual parameter estimates isdetermined. (ANSI [1987] presents anindepth description ofthese steps and gives"}
