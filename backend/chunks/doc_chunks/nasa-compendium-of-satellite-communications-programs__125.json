Radiation 5 Measure electron and proton spectrums** Experiments and spatial distributions as a function of. time. Evaluate radiation damage to solid state devices as a function of shielding. 2. Space 2 Measure spacecraft performance under Experiments launch and, space stresses. 3. Communication 1 Display broadband transmissions by Demonstrations satellite comparable to conventional commercial transmissions. 4. Communication 1 Evaluate technical performance of broad- Experiments band satellite communications. * Program objectives are numbered and defined in Table 6-1. ** Radiation spectrums characterize the number of particles per unit volume as a function of particle energy level. Internal temperatures varied between about 2890.K (600 F) and 3000 K (800 F). The radiated RF power was observed to remain constant as a function of time. The only significant changes observed in circuitry or components were a degradation of solar cell output and the failure of several-transistors within the command decoder of Telstar I. Both of these changes were a result of the radiation encountered. The communication demonstrations, mentioned:in Table '6-8, included a variety of tests whose descriptions and results are indicated in Table 6-9. (29)(30) More than 400 demonstrations were- conducted' in the Telstar program. (31) 6-11 Table 6-9. Telstar I and U Communication Demonstrations Type Demonstration Nature of Results Obtained 1. One-way monochrome TV Highly successful. Some loss of picture definition due to baseband bandwidth limitations* in ground terminals'.' At maximum range, weighted signal­ to-noise somewhat less than for normal Bell System commercial service. Transients from camera-switching at originating studios caused noise bursts in received signals. 2. One-way color TV** With no audio transmitted ***and spacecraft at short to moderate ranges, high quality pictures *ere obtained. 3. Two-way monochrome TV Audio signals transmitted in both directions With' \"definite reduction in quality. Picture quality about 20,dB**** poorer"}
