TELEMETRY AND COMMAND SUBSYSTEMS -24 telemetry functions in PAM-FM, real-time sensor pulses; 64 command functions; ranging. CONTROL SUBSYSTEIV -Redundant hydrazine systems; 8-year stationary stationkeeping capability. POWER SUBSYSTEM -Solar panel and batteries, 200 watts minimum, with full eclipse capability. 18-5 The Telesat satellites are active spin-stabilized multichannel repeater commu­ nications satellites for use in geostationary orbit. Each satellite has twelve high capacity microwave channels and each channel is capable of relaying one color tele­ vision program or up to 960 multiplexed voice signals using a single carrier. Multi­ carrier voice modulated signals can also be accommodated within a microwave channel with some reduction in total capacity. Each channel has a bandwidth of 36 MHz and provides not less than 33 dBW EIRP throughout Canada. The communications antenna beam pattern is shaped and aimed to provide optimum coverage of Canada and the cov­ erage area as seen from the satellite at the 1140 W longitude position is shown in Fig­ ure 18-3. The spaceframe consists of a 76-centimeter (30-inch) diameter thin wall cylin­ der coaxial with the satellite, and a 185-centimeter (73-inch) diameter honeycomb sandwich platform. The cylinder surrounds the apogee motor and supports the spin platform, on which is mounted the communications repeater, telemetry and connand electronics, and the batteries. The platform supports the cylindrical solar panel at its periphery and the despin motor by a pedestal-type support at its center. The solar panel substrate is a honeycomb sandwich with fiberglass laminates, on the interior of which are mounted three dynamic balance mechanisms 1200 apart.
