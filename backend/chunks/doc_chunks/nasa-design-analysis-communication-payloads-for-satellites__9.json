V. Conclusions The creation of these two tools will have shortened the pre-design process for a NASA by performing all the functions needed for a designer as well as making it easy to use for the designer. The link budgetcalculator tool calculates scenarios with diﬀerent parameters such as the link between Earth and weather-observing satellites or transmitting images from rovers on the Jupiter moon, Io, back to Earth. Then thecalculator saves these diﬀerent scenarios in a way so they are easier to compare while integrating relevant 8o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics information into the program. Having all the information in one program allows the link budget analysis to gomoresmoothlyinsteadofhavingtolookuptheradiusofagroundstationantennaordistancebetweentwoplanets. The communication payload tool will shorten the the process of designing the payload by integratingall the information of commercial components in one place, instead of looking up each and every componentthrough separate catalogs. Also, it allows the user to create a visual representation of their design with an intuitive main interface. These two tools are or will be used for NASA missions in communication payload design, and these tools in the future can be expanded on to include more features such as connecting the linkbudget calculator tool together with the communication payload design software to see what componentsare available to meet the requirements of the speciﬁc mission.
