For each frequency, f1 and f2, perform a log -normal fit to the rain attenuation vs. probability of occurrence as follows: Step 1: Calculate Prain (%), the time percentage of rain on the path. Prain can be predicted by P0 (Lat, Lon) from Recommendation ITU -R P.837 for the latitude and longitude of the location of interest. Step 2: For fi, where i = 1 and 2, construct the sets of pairs [ Pi, Ai,1] and [ Pi, Ai,2] where Pi (%) is the time percentage the attenuation Ai,1 (dB) is exceeded, where Pi  Prain. The specific values of Pi should be selected to encompass the probability range of interest; however, a suggested set of time percentages is 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5%, with the constraint that Pi  Prain. Step 3: Divide all time percentages, Pi, by the probability of rain, Prain, to obtain the conditional rain attenuation probabilities rain i i PPp= . Step 4: Transform the two sequences of pairs [ pi, Ai,1] and [ pi, Ai,2] to ()  1,1ln,i i A p Q− and ()  2,1ln,i i A p Q− . Step 5: Estimate the parameters 1, 1, 2 and 2 by performing a least -square fit of the two sequences to ()11 1 1, μ σ ln + =− i i pQ A and ()21 2 2, μ σ ln + =− i i pQ A .
