Aseasonal dependence wasidentified, asshown, throughout ayear ofobservations sampled atdifferent times ofday, seasons, andmeteorological conditions. Itisexpected thatthese mag- nitudesofangle-of-arrival effects maybeexpected over avarietyof operating conditions relatively independent offrequency. Forreference also, themedian RMSfluctuations byseason arealso shown inFigure 22. These data, ranging ininitial elevation angles from thehorizon to43°, represent theminimum elevation angle measurement uncertainties (within afive-minute observation period) tobeexpected duetothetroposphere. Single antenna radar orcommunication systems probably will notachieve better measurement accuraciesorlowerangular position uncertainties,- respectively, than theseforpaths traversing thecomplete troposphere. Amplitude fluctuations produced bythetroposphere exhibit afre- quencydependence predictable bytheory. Theobserved data from the Haystack measurements show arange ofvariability at7.3GHzasindicated inFigure 23through theseasons. Theordinate isKMSfluctuations in logreceived power a(dB) versus theapparent satellite elevation angle.X Measurements atUHF(Millstone Hill Radar, near Haystack) aswell as X-band, produced tropospheric scintillation observations which were in qualitativeagreement with predictions ofweak scintillation theory for 7/12 elevationanglesabove2to3°.Thetheory would predict a(frequency) dependency forthelogpower fluctuationintensity assuminganisotropic turbulentlayer andweak scintillation, a<5dB(Crane, 1977). WhenX these assumptionsarevalid, theamplitude scintillation variance dueto turbulent fluctuations reduce toanexpression (asobtained byTatarski, 1967) given by: 2[20 kT/6.

At 10GHz, the signal may fluctuate atlevels between 0.1andabout 1.0dB depending upon elevationangle andconditions (see Figure 23)with the requirement thatelevation angles areabove about3degrees. At100GHz, thelevelsscale infrequency tolie correspondingly between0.4 and 3.8dB, depending onelevation angleandupon (low orhigh) fluctuation conditions iftherefractive index structure isinvariant over thefre- quency range.
