In spite of this, a number of experimental activities of major significance have taken place and indications are that this typeof activity will acceler­ ate in the future. An example of past activities is the Early Bird tests to evaluate the subjective effects of long transmission delay on telephone subscribers and techniques for re­ ducing echo caused by two wire user terminations to acceptable levels. Although the feasibility of synchronous satellite communications had been successfully demon­ strated in the Syncom program, conclusive results in the two areas indicated had not been obtained. Furthermore, prior to Early Bird, the operational experience re­ quired for a reliable commercial system was not available. The successful opera­ tion of Early Bird (INTELSAT I), for more than 3 years; demonstrated public acceptance of space communications. Inso doing, it proved conclusively that, for single synchronous earth satellite repeaters, transmission delay and echo were not serious problems in the realization of an operational commercial system. Earth sta­ tion experience gained at Andover, Goonhilly Downs, Pleumeur Bodou, and Funico demonstrated that efficient reliable communications could be maintained and heralded the introduction of multistation operations.
