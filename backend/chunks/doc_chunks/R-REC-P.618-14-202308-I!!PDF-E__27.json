The fading is also observed to have a character similar to multipath fading on terrestrial links. Similar to the distribution of fade depths on terrestrial links, the distribution of fade depths for very low angle satellite links also appears correlated with refractivity gradient statistics. The overall fading distribution shows a gradual transition from a scintillation distribution at large exceedance percentages to a multipath fading distribution (with a slope of 10 dB/decade) at small percentages. The prediction methods in §§ 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 for the deep fading and shallow fadin g portions of the overall distribution, respectively, use the refractivity gradient statistic, pL, to describe the climatic variations in the distribution. The net fade distribution due to tropospheric refractive effects, A( p), is the combination of beam spreading, scintillation, and multipath -fading effects described above. Tropospheric and ionospheric scintillation distributions may be combined by summing the respective time percentages that specified fade levels are exceede d. 2.4.1 Calculation of monthly and long -term statistics of amplitude scintillations at elevation angles greater than 5 degrees A general method for predicting the cumulative probability distribution of tropospheric scintillation at elevation angles greater than or equal to 5 degrees is given below. The prediction method is based on monthly or longer averages of temperature and rel ative humidity, and reflects the specific climatic conditions at the Earth -station of interest. Since average surface temperature and average surface relative humidity vary with season, the scintillation fade depth distribution varies with season. The seasonal variation may be predicted by using seasonal average surface temperature and seasonal average surface relative humidity, which may be obtained from weather information for the site of interest.
