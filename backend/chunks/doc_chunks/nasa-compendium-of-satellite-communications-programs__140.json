This center also provided a centralized command post to exercise control over the satel­ lite. Supporting activities included telemetry data processing, orbital prediction, and satellite tracking information. 7.5 EXPERIMENTS Each of the participating stations was asked to submit a detailed experiment .plan concerning those tests in which that particular station would participate. The communications experiments were divided into three classifications: wideband per­ formance experiments, narrowband performance experiments, and system demon­ stration experiments. System performance experiments -wideband and narrowband ­ were intended as objective tests to obtain quantitative and statistical data on the electrical parameters of the system by analyzing the response to carefully controlled executions. The various major types of experiments prepared for the Relay program are outlined in Table 7-6. Details of the experiments were given in the Relay Com­ munications Experiment Plan (RI-0521A). This plan gave the general purpose and description of the individual experiments, and the test procedures for each of the stations. In order to make the most effective use of the entire Relay system, which included the complex of participating earth stations as well as the satellite, it was necessary to schedule the communications experiments with some care. Experiment schedules were initially planned over a 1-month period. It was found useful early in the program to assign operational days during each week to designated stations, with the days assigned arbitrarily. Examination of orbital data *ould then indicate which passes on each day were usable for the station designated for that day. For detailed experimental results the reader is referred to the bibliography. General conclusions were as follows: 7-9 Table 7-6. Major Relay Communication Experiments I.
