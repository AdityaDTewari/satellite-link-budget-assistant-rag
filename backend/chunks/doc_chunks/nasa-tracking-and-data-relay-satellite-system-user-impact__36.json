It is noted that the SYNCOM antenna operated at 1.8 GHz, however, scaling the dimensions to 2.25 GHz for TDRS has negligible effect on the overall antenna weight, which at 1.8 GHz was 2 kilograms. The overall antenna performance and characteristics are given in Table 4.3. 4-19 Table 4.3 SYNCOM Antenna Characteristics Antenna type Skirted collinear dipoles Peak gain 6 dB Beamwidth 24 degrees Dimensions 40 centimeters long Weight 2 kg including support and deployment mechanism Mounting Skirts mounted on rod concentric with spin axis Materials Aluminum, fiberglass, Teflon Polarization Circular Comments Pancake beam; spring-actuated unfolding deploy- ment mechanism 4.3.2 Surveyor (17) The high gain Surveyor antenna was a mechanically steerable circularly polarized slot planar array. The antenna, shown mounted on the spacecraft opposite the solar panel in Figure 4.5, was constructed of thin-walled waveguide and used copper clad sheeting etched to form a modified Franklin array. A more detailed view of the array itself and measured radiation patterns are shown in Figure 4.6. The peak gain achieved at 2 GHz was 27 dB. Characteristics of the Surveyor planar array are given in Table 4.4.
