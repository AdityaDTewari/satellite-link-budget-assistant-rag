Voice Transmission Received quality 3udged excellent on both Echo I and It for voice. Music also excellent on Echo II. Echo I employed 200-Hz to 3-kltz baseband:and frequency deviation of -30 MHz. Echo IHemployed 30-Hz to 15-kHz baseband and frequency deviationof +15 MHz. Capability of reasonable quality on up to 4 voice channels also demonstrated on Echo II. 5. Facsimile Transmission Standard militar machine that normall used 3-kHz v6ice channel was prereporded and played back at 4 times normal speed to give 12-kHz baseband. 1000-Hz tone was simultane­ ously prerecorded for speed control and doppler correction. Using +15-kHz frequency deviation, good quality.with some streaking and distortion due to signal fluctuating below threshold observed. 6. Coherent Bandwidth Appeared to be greater than 12 MHz but less than 70 MHz. Indications were that frequency diversity became effective at abouft 190-MHz frequency spacing. Both amplitude and phase correlation analyses applied to tones at separate frequencies to make these determinations. 7. Space Diversity Little diversity improvement observed for antenna spacings of 724.8 meters (2378 feet). 8. Digital Data Tramsmission' . 'Alternati ones and zeros transmitted by FM or carrier and. conventional detection. Decisions on received signal employed a rhatchid filter (i.: , integrate and dump). Error rates for trrTnsmissiol at 1.2 kbps rate typically ranged between 10. 'and 10 bits/bit. Notes: (1)Determined from analysis of received communications signals and radar returns.
