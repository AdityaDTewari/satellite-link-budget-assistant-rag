Andtothedata communication experimenters andresearchers, they nowhave themethods and tools forconducting and analyzing repeatable data communication system performance measurements onexperimental systems such as ACTS. 2.1 ANSX3I02Approach End-to-end system performance isdescribed bythe performance ofthree system functions: access, user information transfer, anddisengagement. These system functions are quantified bythree performance outcomes: successful performance (speed), incorrect performance (accuracy), and nonperformance (reliability). Seitz andGrubb (1983) define these performance outcomes as follows: i.Successful Performance. The function iscompleted within a specified maximum performance time, and theresult oroutput is exactly what was inte_4ed. Afamiliar example issuccessful connection tothecorrect called party inavoice telephone call. 2.Incorrect Performance. The function iscompleted within the specified maximum performance time, but the result oroutput is somehow different from what was intended. Afamiliar example is the connection toa\"wrong number\" (as aresult ofasystem switching error) inavoice telephone call. 3.Nonperformance. Thefunction isnotcompleted within aspecified maximum performance time. Afamiliar example istheblocking ofa voice telephone call attempt bythesystem (asindicated bya\"all trunks busy\" signal). Asummary ofthe performance outcomes that apply tothevarious system functions isshown inTable i.Incor[ect performance issubdivided into three outcomes: content error, where the information isinerror; location error, where the information was sent tothewrong location; andextra event, where unrequested information was received. Nonperformance issubdivided into two outcomes: system nonperformance, where the system isresponsible for the outage; anduser nonperformance, where theuser isresponsible fortheoutage.
