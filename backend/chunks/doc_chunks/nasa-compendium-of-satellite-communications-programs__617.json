Operations began in July 1974 after launch and initial checkout of Westar I. 20.5.2 System Description The Westar system augments Western Union's extensive microwave relay system which runs across the United States from east to west and also into Texas. The micro­ wave relay system is shown in Figure 20-19. Also shown are the Westar earth station locations. The initial Westar system includes two geostationary satellites in orbit, each with 12 RF channels of 36 MHz bandwidth, and five major earth stations. Each satellite RI channel has a capacity of 1 video channel or 1200 voice channels or 50-60 Mbps digital data in the single-carrier-per-transponder mode. The 12 channel frequency plan is diagrammed in Figure 20-20. 20.5.3 The Space Segment--The Westar Satellite Westar I is on-orbit at 99OW longitude. Westar II was launched in October 1974 and was stationed at 91 0 W longitude. It is presently operating at 123.5 0 W longitude, providing service for RCA. These satellites are almost identical to the Canadian Telesat Anik Satellites. The most significant improvement is an onboard backup despin system which prevents spin-up on loss of pilot. While the early Aniks were designed for launch by a Delta 1914 vehicle, Westars were designed for launch by a Delta 2914 vehicle. A diagram of the satellite is presented in Figure 20-21, and a weight breakdown is given in Table 20-10. A summary of the Westar general characteristics as well as its communications and TT&C subsystems is presented in Table 20-11. A noteworthy innovation is the ground processing and retransmission of sensor-data to attain proper synchronization for the despun antenna. 20-36 THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH EXISTING AND PENDING TERRESTRIAL AND WESTAR MICROWAVE SYSTEMS MAP zOOMPANY EARTH STATION 4c,, m&' \" z0-i9 .10y I1zS'.e Azo ,"}
