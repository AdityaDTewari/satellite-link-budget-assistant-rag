The first commercially viable communication satellites were simple analog micrm:ave repeaters ingeostationary orbit. Their main function wastoprovide point-to-point, high volume trunking for telephone and television systems. • Even with today's increased transponder capacity anddown-link power, higher operating frequencies, time-divisio,_ multiple-access (TDMA), digital modulation, and frequency reuse, communication satellites are still notmuch mo,. than repeaters, Unfortunately, these high volume, point-to-p_int satellite tru:,Li.g services are chose most threatened byoptical fiber systems,Traditionally for geographic separations greater then 800 km, point-to-point satellite trunking has been the most economical trm_smission method (Byrne, 1985). i However, with the introduction ofoptical fiber transmission li_ks this distance advantage isdecreasing.

For $i000 to$2000, almost any broadcast service can bereceived inthe remotest parts ofthe country. Multipoint-to-point, e.g.,oil pipeline monitoring systems (Gonze, 1987), isanother service that communication satellites arebeginning toprovide. Both ofthese areservices that optical fiber transmission systems would behard pressed toprovide economically. Additionally, satellite systems formobile :ommunication applications arebeing developed, aservice that fiber cannot provide. All ofthese services, however, arestill using thesatellite basically asasimple repeater. ! TheNASA ACTS program takes thesatellite be,_ond this simple"}
