The orientation system is switched on, the satellite's tumbling motion is arrested by gas-jets, and the body of the satellite to­ gether with the solar cell panels is oriented toward the sun to maximize the power for the solar cell system. During the entire orbital trajectory, the spacecraft atti­ tude is maintained by a gyro-stabilizer driven by an electric motor so that the solar panels remain directed toward the sun. After sun acquisition, one of the on-board antennas is directed towards the earth by highly sensitive earth sensors. The earth is acquired, and this antenna con­ tinues to track the earth during the entire period of communication. Should it become necessary to switch to the standby antenna, all that is required is to rotate the body of the satellite 1800 about its longitudinal axis, using the gas-jet stabilizers. A block diagram of the transponder \"Alpha\" used in the Molniya-1 spacecraft is shown in Figure 11-7. The principal communication parameters for Molniya-1 and Molniya-2 are summarized in Table 11-2. Both signal reception and transmission are accomplished with the same parabolic spacecraft antenna; isolation filters are used to separate these signals. The signals received from earth stations operating at two different frequencies are further separated by an input duplexer. After intermediate frequency conversion in a silicon diode mixer, the signals are amplified and then 11-12. 0 1 L~ KSMA - L 'aC'[ F1D iF -ARM PAT JLT wvo Te FftOUfC IX m MtISR FILM mIs mm--------,,-iAN Figure 11-7.
