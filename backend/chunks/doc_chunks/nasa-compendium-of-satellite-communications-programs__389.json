To ensure the coherence needed to preserve signal quality dur­ ing frequency conversions, a new technique was developed to directly synthesize 14 of the frequencies from a single frequency standard. Also, from the standpoint of power generated and upper frequency limits, the use of solid-state circuitry surpasses that of previous space communications systems. (40) Table 13-32 shows the specifications for the ATS-6 Communications Subsystem. The operation of the communications subsystem is essential to the successful performance of all the experiments on the ATS spacecraft and to the accomplishment of the primary objective of the ATS-6 mission. The transponder provides the basic interface between the experiments in the satellite and ground terminals. In some instances the transponder is itself a part of the experiment. Figure 13-15 is a block Table 13-33 describes the subsystem characteristics. (41)diagram of the subsystem. The communications subsystem operates to fulfill the requirements of the fol­ lowing modes of operation and experiments: Coherent mode VHR radiometer data transmission Noncoherent mode Radio beacon PLACE experiment Monopulse Tracking and data relay experiment RFI'experiment SITE experiment HET experiment Millimeter wave reception TRUST experiment In the coherent mode all local oscillator signals are derived from a single oscillator phase-locked to the C-band signal carrier transmitted from the ground to the spacecraft. In the noncoherent mode, the local oscillator frequencies are generated within the spacecraft by a highly stable fixed-frequency"}
