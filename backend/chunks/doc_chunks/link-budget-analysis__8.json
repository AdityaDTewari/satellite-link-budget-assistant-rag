Typically, the environmental noise temperature varies with the antenna’s elevation angle :  –The noise temperature below the horizon may be considered as 290 K. –The noise temperature at the local zenith may be less than 5 K. –Low on the horizon, the noise temperature varies from 290 K at the horizon to 100 K at very low elevation angles near the horizon to 5 K near the zenith. 3.For low link margin communications systems, it is generally important to minimize the antenna temperature. Therefore, a half -power beam width somewhat less than 180 tends"}
