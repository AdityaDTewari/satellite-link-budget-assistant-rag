However, the second switching logic system remained in good working order and was able to successfully handle antenna switching except during periods of darkness of the subsatellite point. The satellite was allowed to drift from its initial position to about 930 W longitude and was maintained at this location by the automatic stationkeeping system for several months. During these initial months in orbit, the satellite was employed by tactical terminals of all of the U. S. armed services in tri-service tests and all of the objectives listed in Table 9-10, with the exception of Item.7, were successfully accomplished. On July 23, 1969 a program was initiated to move LES-6 further eastward to about 401V longitude so that the NATO countrieg of Europe could view the spacecraft (3 0 ).
