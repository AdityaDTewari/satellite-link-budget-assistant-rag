The principal characteristics of the spacecraft are presented in Table 7-4. Two completely independent microwave transponders were provided for increased reliability; their configuration is shown in Figure 7-1. Two modes of operation were available with the transponder. The wideband mode was utilized for one-way wideband communications such as television or 300 channels of telephony. The narrowband mode was utilized for two-way communications such as 12-channel two-way telephony. In the narrow-band mode, two ground stations could commu­ nicate with each other, one transmitting on 1723.33 MHz, the other transmitting on 1726. 67 MHz. The spacecraft transponder converted these frequencies to 4165 VFHz and 4175 MHz, respectively. As noted previously, the modulation index was tripled to compensate for the bandwidth limitations imposed by the earth terminal klystron transmitters. f =68.33 MHz LOCAL 1725.0LLz-WOR TWO-WAY TiLEPHONELOA 1726.0 M~z-WB IF BANUPASS LIMITER TRIPLER £TT 46.2MzW 1723.333 MHz AMPLIFIER I FILTER ZNB M}-N 4164.72 MHz 1726.6677~ = 7 1 6 7 76f, 67 MH z 4174.72 MHz TRiPLER BFACON Figure 7-1.
