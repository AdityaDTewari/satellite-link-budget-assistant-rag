ITU-R S.1528 5 Recommended antenna patterns for non-GSO satellite multiple beam antennas operating in the FSS below 30 GHz are given in Annex 1; 1.4 the reference pattern given by an analytical function which models the side lobes of the non-GSO satellite. In the study of frequency sharing between non-GSO systems, taking into account a non-GSO satellite antenna diagram as realistic as possible allows a more accurate analysis of the interference, while limiting the overestimation of it.
