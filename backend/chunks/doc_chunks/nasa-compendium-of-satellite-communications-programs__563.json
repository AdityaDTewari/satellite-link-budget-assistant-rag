Northern Telecommunications Station at Resolute -Block Diagram An 8. 1-meter (26.5-foot) diameter antenna provides a G/T of 26 dB/PK or 22 dB/°K depending upon the type of low voice amplifier used. The antennas are fixed as no tracking capability is required because of the accuracy of the satellite station­ keeping. Either G/T provides a video signal-to-noise ratio greater than 48 dB and an audio signal-to-noise ratio greater than 53 dB. All of these antennas are provided with sub-reflector de-icing and some, where icing conditions are severe, are equipped with electrical de-icing for the main reflector. A photograph of a typical Remote Television station is shown in Figure 18-19 and a block diagram is given in Figure 18-20. 18.4.5 The Thin Route (TR) Stations The Thin Route stations are engineered to provide message service to small com­ munities where the traffic demand can be satisfied with a relatively few number of telephone circuits, typically in the order of two to eight. These stations utilize single voice channel per carrier techniques with delta modulation and biphase PSK (digital) transmission. Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is used to access the sat- O ellite. Initially, the carriers are on pre-assigned frequencies; however, demand assignment techniques and voice activation may ultimately be used to increase system flexibility and capacity."}
