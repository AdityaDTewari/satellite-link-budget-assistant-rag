It differs from some ofthemodels currently available inthatitisbased entirely onmeteorological observations, not attenuation measurements. Themodel was tested bycomparison with attenuation measurements. This procedure wasused tocircumvent therequirement forattenuation obser- vations over aspan ofmany years. Themodel isanextension ofthe Global Prediction Model developed byCrane forthe 1978 CCIR Special Preparatory Meeting (CCIR, 1978a). Themodelisbased upon theuseof independent, meteorologically derived estimates forthe cumulative dis- tributions ofpoint rainfall rate, horizontal path averaged rainfall rate, thevertical distribution ofrain intensity, andupon atheoretically derivedrelationship betweenspecific attenuation andrain rateobtained using median observed drop size distributions atanumber ofrain rates. The first step inapplication ofthemodel isthe estimation ofthe instantaneous point rain rate distribution (Rp). TheGlobal Prediction Model provides mediandistribution estimates for broad geographical regions; eight climate regions Athrough Hare designated toclassify IS regions covering theentire globe. Figures8and9show thegeographic rain climate regions forthecontinental andocean areas oftheearth. TheUnited States andHuropean portions arefurther expanded inFigures I0andII,respectively. Theclimate regions depicted bytheglobal model arevery broad. Theupper andlower rain rate bounds provided bythenearest adjacent region have aratio of3.Sat0.01 percent oftheyear fortheproposed CCIR climate region D,forexample, producing anattendant ratio of upper-to-lower bound attenuation values of4.3dBat12GHz.This uncer- taintyintheestimated attenuation value canbereduced byusing rain rate distributions tailoredtoaparticular area iflong termstatistics areavailable.
