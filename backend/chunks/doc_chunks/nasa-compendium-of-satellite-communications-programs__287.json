S. and Russia have reached an agreement on an improved direct com­ munications link. The improvements will provide two independent and parallel satel­ lite communications circuits, each using a separate communication satellite system in each country. The U. S. will provide a circuit via the Intelsat system while the Russians will provide a circuit via the Molniya II system. 11-5 The U. S. Satellite portion is a leased duplex voice bandwidth circuit from a Comsat Earth Station.at Etam, West Virginia, through an Intelsat IV satellite, to a USSR-provided earth station at Moscow. The USSR satellite portion is a duplex voice bandwidth circuit from a Molniya H earth station at Vladimir, USSR, through Molniya II satellites, to a U. S. -provided earth station at Fort Detrick, Maryland, T(1) (See Paragraph 11.4.1 for a description of the U. S. -supplied earth terminal.) 11.1.2 Schedule Satellite launch schedules for Molniya-1 and -2 are shown in Figures 11-4 and 11-5, respectively. From Figure 11-4 it is also noted that six Molniya-1 satellites are currently operational in orbit. 11.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 11.2.1 Control Subsystem The Molniya command and measuring radio link is a complex of radio technical facilities which provide not only for control of the satellite but also for measurement of the parameters of the satellite movement in orbit as well as for checking on the condition of the satellite's systems. The positional control of the satellite, the switching off of spaceborne apparatus, and the transmission of telemetric data from the satellite are done with the telemetric command system. Commands reach the satellite in an encoded form"}
