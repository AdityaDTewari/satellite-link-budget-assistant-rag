Crossing the wave through a rain area, a cross polarization e ect appears due to this e ect. Attenuation due to clouds and fog. Recommendation ITU-R P.840-5 It is quite equivalent to the rain attenuation method The attenuation values are smaller Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 20/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsFriis formula Antennas Polarization Propagation Estimated ionospheric e ects for elevation angles of about 30o Estimated ionospheric e ects for elevation angles of about 30o The e ects at 500 MHz are: Faraday rotation 1.2 rotations Propagation delay 1 \u0016s Refraction<2:40 Variation in the direction of arrival (r.m.s.) 48\" Absorption (auroral and/or polar cap) 0.2dB Absorption (mid-latitude) <0:04dB Dispersion 0.0032 ps/Hz Scintillation up to 27.5 dB Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 21/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsFriis formula Antennas Polarization Propagation Faraday rotation Faraday rotation When propagating through the ionosphere, a linearly"}
