Theprimary measure ofcircuit or transmission quality fordigital systems isthebiterror rate (BER). Semantically, weuse\"bit\" error rate because theoverwhelming majority of digital communications systems transfer binary data streams.* Biterror rate usuallY applies over amoderately short term, andnormally •does not incorporate \"errors\" oroutages ofduration longer than afewtens ofbits.!.. Formost digital systems, thebiterrop probability canbeexpressed asafunction oftheenergy-per-bit tonoise power spectral density ratio (Eb/No). These relationships areavailable forthetheoretical performance ofcommonly used modulation andcoding systems from anygood communication theory reference (e;g., Schwartz, etal-1966 andSpilker-lg77). Thetheoretical BEPvs.Eb/Norelations usually assume white, Gaussian noise. Inthepresence ofnon-white ornon-Gaussian noise,or interference, these relations arenotaccurate. Itisnowbecoming common to express theperformance ofactual systems interms oftheEb/Norather than CNR. Eb/Noisnumericallyequal totheratio ofsignal power to noise power within a(noise) bandwidth equal inhertz tothedigital bitrate inbits persecond. (Note that bitrate isnotingeneral thesame assymbol rate.) Forexample, the(theoretically ideal) performance ofbinary PSK modulation requires anEb/Noof9.6dBforaBERof10-5. *Weshouldalso distinguishbetweenbiterror rate, which defines theactual performance, andmust bemeasured byaveragin_--6_er asequence ofbits communicated, andthebiterror probability (BEP), which isatheoretical concept that canapply even toasingle bit. BERwill beusedhere, since itismore common, eventhoughBEPistechnically more correct. 356 •\" ............. ,....................................... : :....... ....... ....... Inthecase ofdigital systems usedtoaccommodate fundamentally analog requirements (e.g.,PCMvoice channels), there exists athreshold error rate atwhich circuit quality isconsidered unacceptable. This threshold value then determines thepoint atwhich an\"outage\" exists. Because error rate isasensitivefunction ofEb/No, circuit quality degrades quite drastically when Eb/Nofalls below thevalue corresponding tothe threshold error rate.

Rather, thedata isoften formatted inblocks orpackets. Inmany cases, then, theperformance requirement"}
