The other two TWTAs can be connected to either the NB antenna, one as a backup to the other, or to the WB antenna, with either TWTA functioning as a backup to the first two TWTAs which are connected only to the WB antenna. **The ERIPs given for-the 50-MItz, 17-MHz and the 85-MHz transponder chanmels are based on operating the TWTAs at saturated power output. During no-jamning conditions and when operating by FM/FDMA, the TWTAs will be operated in the linear mode at about 5 dBW less than that shown to reduce interniodulation and conserve bandwidth. ***The \"NB 17-Mhz channel\" will use the same TWTA and NB antennas as the \"NB 85-MIz channel\"; therefore, the two channels will share the ElRP (35 dBW) available from the common TWTA and N3 antenna. 16-18 xoiWV P KI GR QiAG4., 16.4 GROUND TERMINALS 1. Phase II. The NATO SATCOM Phase II system utilizes 12 ground ter­ minals. The ground terminals at Belgium (Li) and Germany (L2) are the master stations of the network. Table 16-10 summarizes the characteris­ tics of the NATO ground teiminals. The antenna is a 13-meter (42-foot) diameter Cassegrain with a reflector shaped to provide high efficiency. It is mounted on a fully steerable azimuth/elevation mount. A simplified diagram of the essentials of the communications chain is shown in Figure 16-5. 2. Phase III. Specifications for the ten additional Phase Ill earth terminals have not yet been released. The following design considerations apply to the Phase III earth terminals: * A major objective of"}
