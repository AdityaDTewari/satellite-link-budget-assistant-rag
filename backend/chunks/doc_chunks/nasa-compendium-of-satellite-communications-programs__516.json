The FM modems will be capable of modulating an RF carrier with up to 72 voice channels delivered to the terminal in a baseband form from a-separate tech­ nical control facility. Operation of contingency terminals during this stage will be via the satellite NB antennas. In Stage ib the Phase II system will operate in the FDMA mode to provide a multipoint network satellite communications capability and the code division multiple access (CDMA) mode to provide point-to-point protected (i. e., janf resistant) com­ munications. New FM and PSK modems and FDM multiplexers will be purchased to provide the capacity required to fulfill the Stage lb requirement. The PSK modems will replace MFSK modems for wideband data and secure voice services. A number of earth terminals will provide a multiple carrier transmission/reception capability. These terminals will be deployed to locations (defined as nodal locations) to satisfy specific DSCS requirements. 17-3 120 ISO 180 150 120 9 60 30 0 30 60 30 1 30 r ,- 0 a Fig re ATpiRMINcLt. 12 SoIO 10906 30 0 60 120 ISO M8 ISO 120 90 0 30 0 3 C 6 Figure 17-1. A Typical System Configuration for Stage la Stage lb will use multiple receive and transmit carriers at selected locations (nodes) to support links in a multipoint network operating via a single satellite. Traffic will range from 12 to 24 voice channels on the AN/MSC-46 pairs to three voice chan­ nels between the AN/MSC-46 and AN/TSC-54 terminals. A few links will be used to provide wideband digital traffic between selected areas in support of wideband data and digitized voice requirements as in Stage la. A typical DSCS Phase II Stage lb link configuration is given in Figure 17-2. The four satellite configuration is a typical link"}
