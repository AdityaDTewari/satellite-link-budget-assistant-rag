While equation (11) can be evaluated by numerical integration2, the slant path gaseous attenuation is well-approximated by dividing the atmosphere into exponentially increasing layers, determining the specific attenuation (dB/km) of each layer and the path length (km) through each layer, and summing the product of th e specific attenuation of each layer and the path length through each layer as shown in equation (13). In the absence of local temperature, dry air pressure, and water vapour partial pressure profiles vs. height (e.g. from radiosonde data), any of the six reference standard atmospheres (i.e. the mean annual global reference atmosphere, the low -latitude reference atmosphere, the mid - latitude summer reference atmosphere, the mid -latitude winter reference atmosphere, the high - latitude summer reference atmosphe re, or the high -latitude winter reference atmosphere) given in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 may be used. 𝐴𝑔𝑎𝑠=∑ 𝑎𝑖 𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖=1 (dB) (13) where i is the specific attenuation (dB/km) of the ith layer per equation (1), and 𝑎𝑖 is the path length (km) through the ith layer. For a slant path between the surface of the Earth and space and referring to the geometry in Fig. 5, the thickness of the layers increases exponentially from 10 cm at the surface of the Earth to ~1 km at a height of ~100 km to ensure an accurate estimate o f the total slant path gaseous attenuation. The thickness of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ layer, δ𝑖, is: δ𝑖=0.0001 𝑒𝑖−1 100 (km) (14) ℎ1=0, and ℎ𝑖, the height of the bottom of layer 𝑖 for 𝑖≥2, is: ℎ𝑖=∑ δ𝑗=0.0001 𝑒𝑖−1 100−1 𝑒1 100−1𝑖−1 𝑗=1 (15) If one of the six reference standard atmospheres specified in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 is used, the atmospheric profile is defined for geometric heights up to 100"}
