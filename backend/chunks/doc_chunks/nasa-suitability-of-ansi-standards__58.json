A detailed application ofthese models can befound inPritchard and Sciulli (1986) andFlock (1988).

To leduce this distortion, thepower amplifier is\"backed off,\" i.e., operated _ bel.vsaturation. Amplifier manufacturers supply transfer characteristic curxes from _hich therequired back-off forthesystem canbedetermined. Intermodu!ation distortion ismore prevalent inFM/FDM/FDMA systems with multiple carriers andcontributes tothequantities known asAM-AM andAM-PM ] co_.0ersion and crosstalk.

Problems with intermodulation distortion highlight the advantages of i digital modulation andTDMA systems, _ith most digital modulation techniques, _ the signal has aconstant envelope, thus reducing the AM-AM and AM-PM conversion and intermodulation products. With TDMA systems there isonly one carrier present atatime, thus intermodulation distortion ise,,en further J reduced. This allows thetransponder tobeoperated closer tosaturation, thus increasing the down link EIRP. However, there isstill the -_otential for j ! intermodulation distortion duetoedjacent transponders. _i There aretwoways toimplement back-off: Input back-off (BOi), where the i Jpower flux density atthe satellite receive antenna isreduced, sndoutput back-off (BOo) ,where the satellite power amplifier gain isreduced.
