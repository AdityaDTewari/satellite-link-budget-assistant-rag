Typical ANIK EIRP Contours in dBW The parabolic antenna also supports the torodial beam command and telemetry antenna used during the transfer orbit. The antenna pattern covers Canada--the second largest country in area in the world--from St. John's, Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the east to beyond Vancouver to the Alaskan border on the west, and north to such remote communities as Resolute and Igloolik above the Arctic Circle. In orbit, ANIK's 4-kilogram (9-pound) antenna remains stationary, pointed toward Canada, as the 2-meter (5-foot) high cylindrical body of the satellite revolves at 100 rpm."}
