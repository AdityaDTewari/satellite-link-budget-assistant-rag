Inthe foregoing, adjustment ofsystem parameters hasbeen carried outsimultaneously with thedevelopmentoftheexamples. Thesystem designer maychoose touse this approach, ortodefer these adjustments untilthis point intheprocess. Todothis inanorganized manner, oneshould accumulate allpropagation impairments which are(orcanbeequated to)attenuations orlosses into a composite margin. Increases inskynoise,andtheinterference components, canbeequated tolosses insignalpower, aspreviously discussed.This composite margin will beoffset'by power orgain adjustments. These margins andconsequent system parameter adjustments areapplied tothenominal system performance budget. Intheanalog example, thiswasthe10,000 pWOp criterion.
