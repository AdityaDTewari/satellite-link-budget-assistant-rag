(20) (21) 8.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The communications system operations on Project Syncom displayed that highly reliable synchornous satellite communications systems were feasible. During the initial experimental period of the program, operational responsibility for the Syncom satellites rested with NASA while DOD operated and maintained the ground communi­ cations terminals. In early 1965, DOD added the satellites \"toits operational respolisi­ bilities and employed them to provide operational military communications for the Far East, Pacific Ocean area, and Western United States. During all of the time the Syncom satellites were actively employed, no significant operational difficulties were encountered. Minor difficulties included a slight gas leak, a buildup of H202 pressure, and one receiver occasionally going into oscillation upon turn on under high space­ craft temperature conditions. Ground terminal operation and tracking was, in general, routine. 8-12 4 Table 8-8. Communications Performance Experiments TYPE EXPERIMENT NATURE OF RESULTS OBTAINED 1. Telephony Single channel S4N/N of 35 dB* readily attained with\" maximum FM deviation** ratio employed. Multichannel-- operation demonstrated on Syncom Il1at reduction in per channel performance. 2. Data Transmission Using vestigial sideband modems operating into 4-kHz baseband input to normal FM terminal equipment, 3-kbps rates at low error rates**** were possible Using PSK RF modulation, data rates as high as 50 kbps were possible. 3. Teletype For single channel operation into 4-kHz baseband input to normal FM terminal equip­ment, error rates of 0.1% were readily attained For I of 16 channels into 4-kHz base­ band, error rates less than 1%were attained. Facsimile Operating into standard FM terminal equipment, overall picture quality numerically rated at 7 on a 0to 10 scalewas commonly obtained Factors degrading quality included bandwidth limitationst phase delay distortion,t and satellite spin rate modulation 5.
