Morita andHiguti (1978) computed atheoretical correlation coefficient asa function ofsite separationthat isconsistent with Japanese experimental results. \"However, there issome evidence suggesting that theJapanese correlation model does notapply aswell toU.S. data (Wallace-1981). Itis likely that thecorrelation coefficient ishighly dependent onother factors beside site separation, such aslocal \"microclimate\" variations andorographic effects (AlInutt-1978 ). 6.6PREDICTIONOFSIGNALFLUCTUATIONS ANDLOW-ANGLE FADINGONEARTH-SPACE PATHS Theamplitude, phase,andangle-of-arrival ofamicrowave signal passing through thetroposphere vary duetoinhomogeneities inthe refractivity (clear air). Theeffects occurontime scales shorterthan a minute andonspatialscales shorterthan akilometer. Atlowelevation angles, theamount oftroposphere traversed issignificant, andso,below approximately 10degree elevation angles, low-angle fading must beconsidered. 6.6.1AntennaApertureEffects Theeffectsoftropospheric turbulences andtheantenna cannotbe totally decoupled because, ofcourse, themeasurements andoperatingsystems utilize antennas. Theantenna aperture processes thgincident wavefront with itsspatialandtemporal fluctuations into areceived signalwith only temporal variations. P 279 Wavefront tilt duetoinhomogeneities andgradients inthe refractivity appear totheantenna asanangle-of-arrival variation. Average elevation angle raybending isusually 10times more pronounced than azimuthal raybending. However, wave tilt fluctuations tend toberandomly distributed inangle relative totheslant path propagation direction, atleast when the majority ofthepath isabove theregime ofsurface effects (surface effects extend upwards several hundred meters).i\" C i. i Fluctuationsoccurringonspatialscalessmallerthan thesizeofthe aperture areoften referred toaswavefront ripple. This phase incoherence results inaninstantaneous gain lossordegradation. Thefluctuations describedhereinapply totheground station downlink because itsantenna isinclose proximity totheturbulent medium. Anuplink satellite path will sufferfluctuation gain degradationonly dueto scattering ofenergy outofthepath. Because ofthelarge distance traversed bythewave since leaving thetroposphere, thewave arrives atthesatellite antenna asaplane wave (noripple) andwith onlyminute angle-of-arrival effects. Interference tosatellites onthegeostationary arccanoccurdueto therefraction anddiffraction ofradio relay linksorientedtoward the satellite (seeCCIR-1978, Rpt. 393-2). 6.6.2 Amplitude Fluctuations• 6.6.2.1 Overview.Thephenomenaofamplitudeandangle-of-arrival fluctuations combine toform received signal amplitude fluctuations. Formany cases ofpropagation oneormore ofthese effects mayoftenbeneglected.For example, areceiving system which employs anantenna with awide beamwidth will notexperience angle-of_arrival-induced amplitude fluctuations formost elevation angles. However,such simplification isnotalways possible. The theory ofwave propagationandscattering inrandom media allows acombination oftheturbulence induced effects tobeperformed inthecontext ofweak fluctuations"}
