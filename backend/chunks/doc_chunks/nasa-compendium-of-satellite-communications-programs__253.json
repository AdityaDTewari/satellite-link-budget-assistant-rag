Communications System Block Diagram for INTELSAT II 0 eclipse periods occasionally experienced in the synchronous orbit. The communica­ tion characteristics of'INTELSAT II are sh6wn in Table 10-14. Because the communications subsystem of the INTELSAT III satellites provided for two independent transponders, these spacecraft more closely resemble INTELSAT I than INTELSAT II. The most significant difference between the INTELSAT I and INTELSAT Ill transponders is that whereas the former was a hard-limiting, non­ linear, double-conversion repeater, the latter is a linear, single-conversion repeater. This is in agreement with the INTELSAT II design. The INTELSAT III transponder has a bandwidth of 225 MHz. Together two transponders cover most of the 500-MHz bandwidth allocated to the communication satellite service in the 4,-GHz and 6-GHz bands. The initial satellites in the INTELSAT IH series employed single tunnel-diode amplifiers in the receiver. However, after satellite F-3 lost 6 dB of transponder gain due to a malfunction in one stage of the tunnel-diode amplifier, ill subsequent spacecraft were provided with redundant receive amplifiers t6 enhance the overall subsystem reliability. A block diagram of the satellite communications subsystem is provided in Figure 10-3. Communications characteristics of the satellite are sum­ marized in Table 10-15. A further important distinction between INTELSAT I and INTELSAT III appears in the communication antennas. The antennas of INTELSAT I were symmetrical about the spin axis to maintain constant antenna gain. INTELSAT III employes a mechanically despun antenna. This mechanically despun antenna is the most important innovation in this series of satellites, and perhaps the most critical. Special lubri­ cants are used for the bearings, which are exposedto the hard vacuum of space and a wide temperature range. Because INTELSAT I)has"}
