TWT #2 (Varian) still operational *At initial orbital injection. Attitude control and stationkeeping maneuvers change orbital parameters. **Positions were chosen so that at the extremities (i. e., 150 W and 290 W) the minimum elevation angle from any NATO ground terminal would be greater than 100. 16-2 The operational requirements dictated the utilization of 12 stationary earth terminals located near the capital cities of the 12 participating countries. Although the terminals are fixed, they can be disassembled and relocated to a prepared site. Table 16-2 is a summary of the 12 earth terminals of the NATO SATCOM Phase II system. The operational objective of the NATO SATCOM Phase II system has been to provide readily available voice and telegraph communication circuits between the NATO countries and the military and political headquarters. All terminals have been installed, tested and accepted. System accept­ ance was completed in February 1973. 3. NATO SATCOM Phase III is being planned as an evolutionary follow-on to the Phase II system to provide satellite communications during 1975-1980. Higher powered satellites, comparable in capability to the U. S. DSCS Phase II satellites, were procured in early 1973 to"}
