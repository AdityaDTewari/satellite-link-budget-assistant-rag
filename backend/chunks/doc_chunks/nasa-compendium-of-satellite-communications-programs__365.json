Typical link performance for modes involving the L-Band downlink and a high uplink S/N was as described in Table 13-22 for a narrowband L-L FM/FM link. The frequency translation modes were not designed primarily for multiple 13-40 access. The planned multiple access modes of operation employed the L-L SSB/FM and the L-C SSB/FM satellite transponder configurations. Table 13-22.

(10, 28, 29) Block diagrams of the three possible modes of the SHI transponders were shown in Figures 13-2, 3 and 4. The Table displays some of the major system design-differences in synchronous-altitude and medium-altitude gravity gradient stabilized communications satellites. These include, for'the latter, low antenna gains for earth coverage beams; no need for an onboard apogee motor and spin stabilization prior to positioning \"on station;\" and no need for stationkeeping during gravity gradient stabilization \"on station.\" Characteristics of most of the communifcations-related. subsystems on ATS-5 are shown in Table 13-24.1 0 ' 30, 3 A functional diagram depicting the L-Band transponder, and its various selectable modes, is given in Figure 13-10. (82) With the exception of the antenna system, the dharacteristics of the onboard millimeter wave equipment are not described in the Table since thi-s equipment does not include a millimeter wave communications transponder. Its primiary purpose was simply to make propagation measurements. 13'41"}
