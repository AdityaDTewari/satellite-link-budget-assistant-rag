(1) (2) (4-7) Satellite launchings and the collection of tracking and telemetry data through a worldwide network -of Minitrack stations were provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Probably the most important contribution of Project Telstar, to satellite communications technology, was to publicize, through numerous television demonstrations, that orbiting satellites were feasible for use in commercial communication systems. From a purely technical viewpoint, one of the most important achievements was to confirm (in basic agreement with Echo I experience) that standard transmission parameters could be employed to predict performance with no concern about multipath fading for frequencies approaching 4 to 6 GHz and 6-2 ground antenna elevation angles greater than a few.degrees. A second technical achievement of major importance was to demonstrate further that acquiring and tracking a moving satellite was not an.overlydemanding assignment for a narrow­ beam communications antenna equipped with an autotrack system.
