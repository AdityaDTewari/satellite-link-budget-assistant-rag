Following theRBisthedown link traffic burst (DTB) carrying aJlthedown link traffic forthat particular dwell area.As shown inFigure 9(a), there isanRBandDTBforeach dwell time slot. As shown inFigure 9(b), when anearth station inaparticular dwell area needs fade compensation, itscoded traffic isappended totheRBandmoved toadown l_nk fade control slot. Theuncoded traffic fortheother user earth stations istransmitted intheir normal time slots. Thefinal down link burst isthereceive acquisition burst (RAB). This is transmitted touser earth stations first entering thenetwork. Like theup link TAB, theRAB isused forearth station timing acquisition andnetwork synchronization.. TheRABisalso FECcoded. TheACTS LBRTDMA frame isdivided into 1728 slots orwords, each 64bits long, equating tothe110.592 Mb/s transmission rate. Every 75th frame (every 75ms)isdeclared asuperframe. TbeMCSsends oneoutbound order wire message per frame, user earth stations send one inbound order wire message per superframe. Figure 10 shows the time sequence for establishing, using, and disconnecting a64kb/s _CTS LBR circuit. The sequence begins with auser signaling theoriginating user earth st_tion thathe/she wishes toplace a call. Theoriginating user's earth station transmits, via theinbound order wire, acircuit requestmessage containing thedestination user's earth station identification number and the circuitidentification number. The circuit identification number isused toidentify thecircuit throughout itsexistence andconsists oftheterrestrial channel number andtheoriginating user's earth st_zion identification number. Thecircuit request message also hasastation- co-station communications field forterrestrial circuit signaling information. After receiving and processing the circuit request message, the MCS allocates uplink anddown link capacity andassigns TDMA frame slots. Italso stores thi:_ assignment information inanactive circuit tile listing the current resources allocated toeach circuit inthenetwork. Itthen sends a c_rcuit assignment message via the outbound order wire tothe circuits originating anddestination earth stations. This message contains thecircuit identification number, destination terminal number, uplink anddown link slot i assignments, and down link portion ofthe station-to-station terrestrial ! circuit signaling information. _ 45 i 1989010985-055 _"}
