This performance was for production model modems optimized for the 2.4-kbps data rate. Lincoln Laboratory prototype TATS mode'ms achieved much nearer to theoretical performance at both data-rates. 'Production TATS modems also displayed poor operational reliability. The triple diversity modem displayed a significant degree of protection against multipath and, RFI as did the TATS modem. The TATS modem also supplied as in-band multiple access capability. Multiple access tests were successfully conducted employing narrowband FM voice, triple diversity teletype, TATS 2400 bps, and TATS teletype separately and in mixed modes (33). Up to 17 TATS 2400 bps accesses through LES-6 into a C-135 aircraft terminal were demonstrated to be feasible (5 0 ). However, TATS, as designed with its short period frequency hopping pattern (i. e., it repeats every 7 symbols) suffered from considerable interference due to related address codes. With even as few as two common frequencies between two hopping patterns the cross correlation was sufficiently high to make false acquisitions so prevalent that acquiring the proper signal was almost impossible. Therefore, the hopping patterns present in a multiple access environment had to be severly constrained. These restrictions, in some cases, limited the number of premissible users below that theoretically indicated by consideration of available power and'bandwidth alone. Table 9-20. Tactical Modem Performance Modem Nature of Results 1. TATS Eb/N o of 11.5 dB and 13.5 dB required for 10-4 probability of error at 2.4 kbps and 75 bps data rates respectively. At these levels of Eb/No -3 acquisition failure rates were less than 10. 2. Triple Diversity Eb/N of 12 dB required for probability of error - less &an 103 at 75 bps data rate. No acquisition problem existed. 3. FM Voice Narrowband FM gave acceptable quality at Pr/No--50 dB"}
