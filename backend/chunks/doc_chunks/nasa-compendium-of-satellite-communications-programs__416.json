During presentationof the patient, physiological information such as EKGo and heartbeat may be sent simul­ taneously via one or more of the four aural channels associated with the televised picture. Talk-back to the presenting clinics will be accomplished via ATS-1, since simultaneou ,two-way transmission through ATS-6 is not possible in this mode. Jf, needed, the Tanana physician will \"call in\" the specialists at Fairbanks and the ANMC to examine the patient. After, the consultation, the physician prepared his report and transmits it via ATS-1 to the patient's medical, record stored in Tucson. For the sake of privacy all video and audio associated with the consultation will be scrambled. 13-102 Only the presenting clinic and consulting staffs will be able to unscramble the infor­ mation. 13.4.5.5.2 Health Education The health education experiment will test the feasibility of providing instruction to medical students via satellite, so that aspiring physicians in states without medical schools will have an opportunity to study medicine on an equal footing with students in other states. The medical education experiment is in two parts: basic science and clinical medicine. 1. Basic Science--Instruction in the basic sciences will involve the faculty at the University of Washington in Seattle and students and faculty at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks- There will be full two-way voice and video interaction for classes in basic sciences (chemistry, biology, etc.), administrative qonferencing, counseling, and computer-aided, instruction and evaluation of student performance. Lectures, demonstrations, and classroom experiments 'will originate from both sites, and a lively inter­ change between students and faculties at both ends is expected. 2. Clinical Medicine--The part of the health education experiment dealing with clinical medicine will involve third and fourth year medical students studying under clinicians at Omak, in"}
