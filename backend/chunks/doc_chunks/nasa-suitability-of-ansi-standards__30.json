Disengagement Time Disengagement Time isthe elapsed time fromauser _ssuing acircuit disconnection request towhen that user can make another circuit request. Disengagement Time isoneofthesignificant parameters forquantifying DAMA system performance because itgives anindication ofhow soon auser may establish another circuit. ._ Disengagement Denial Probability Disengagement Denial Probability forDAMA systemsistheprobability that a circuit isnotdisconnected after theusers have issued disengagement requests. Theprimary causes fordisengagement denial arethesame asthose forincorrect access--errors inthe request orBTP generation and distribution. Because these errors are rare due tothe network error detection and correction techniques, Disengagement Denial Probability isnotincluded inthesetofDAMA system performance parameters. 3.2.4 Ancillary Parameters The ancillary parameters quantify theimpact onsystem performance due to theuser's interaction with thesystem. The following discussion identifies andestimates theuser's influence onsystem performance, described bythefour ancillary performance parameters, forthevarious TDMA systems. li UserFractionofAccessTime TheUser Fraction ofAccessTime isapplicabletoDAMA systems.Itisthe time ittakes auser toissue anaccess request andenter the destination 34 i1989010985-044 address information (i.e., \"dial thenumber\"), andforthedestination user to answer. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, this parameter would besmall, thus Access Time would bedominated bythe DAMA system operation. But, iftheusers arehuman operators with telephones,Access Time would bedominated bytheusers interactions. TheUser Fraction ofAccess Time indicates how much involvement theuser has inthe system operation. This parameter isincluded inthesetofDAMA system performance parameters. User Fraction ofBlockTransfer Time TheUser Fraction offlock Transfer Time isthetime ittakes togenerate a block ofuser's data. Iftheusers arehost computers transferring files, the user information blocks areusually ready fortransfer;thus, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time would besmall. However, ifthe users are human operators, where theblocks areassembled attheuser's terminal andtheblock assembly depends ontheoperator's typing speed, theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time becomes asignificant part oftheoverall Block Transfer Time. Because theUser Fraction ofBlock Transfer Time islargely system independent itisnotincluded inthesetofTDMA systemperformance parameters. User Fraction ofInput/Output Time TheUser Fraction ofInput/Output Time isthetime ittakes toenter and extract"}
