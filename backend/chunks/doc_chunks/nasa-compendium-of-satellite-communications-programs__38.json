These antennas provided gains of about 6 dB. With the feasibility of satellite communications demonstrated and the basic system concepts defined, interest turned in the mid-1960s to implementing operational systems, further refinements of spacecraft and ground terminal technologies, and developing advanced modulation and multiple-access techniques, including those designed specifically for handling digital communications traffic. In 1965 and into late 1966, the Intelsat and Molniya programs provided the beginnings of what was later to develop into extensive operational systems. During this same period, the X-Band portion of the LES program began to investigate-technology refinements and advanced techniques. 1-15 In early 1965, Intelsat I (Early Bird) was launched into a geostationary orbit with the spacecraft located over the Atlantic Ocean and after a short checkout period introduced the first continuous commercial communications services provided by satellite. Early Bird employed satellite technology developed in Project Syncom to provide communications between terminals that were, for the most part, upgraded and modified versions of installations developed during Projects Telstar and Relay. Early Bird provided a duplex high capacity trunk between the United States and Europe. Its main technological contribution was to demonstrate, finally and conclusively, through extensive subjective user evaluations, that time delay and echo are not serious problems in synchronous satellite communications. Shortly after the Early Bird launch, the first of the Molniya satellites, developed by the U.S. S. R., began to appear in orbit. These spacecraft employed orbits uniquely suited to provide service to regions lying entirely in the Earth's northern hemisphere. The orbits selected are highly elliptical, with 12-hour periods and apogees occurring over the northern hemisphere. These satellites provided the Soviet Union with a long-haul, cross-continent, Moscow-to-Vladivostok communications trunk. Major spacecraft technological innovations included flywheel stabilization,"}
