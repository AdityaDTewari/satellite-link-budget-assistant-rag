Courier: Communications Transponder 4.4 GROUND TERMINALS The ground terminals employed at Fort Monmouth and Camp Salinas were essentially identical. Major characteristics of these terminals are displayed in Table 4-6. (1) (2) (3) Major subsystems are illustrated in the block diagram of Figure 4-2. (3) 4-6 Table 4-6.

Effective bandwidth of signal from modulator was a maximum of about 200 kHz. t Crossed dipoles at 450 to horizontal and vertical employed. t t\" Terminal included antenna, 3 semitrailers, and a maintenance van plus power generators. 4-7 As the figure indicates, the system was primarily designed to handle teletype traffic since digital messages are normally more compatible with store-and-forward operation than analog messages. The terminals included a record and playback speed changing capability in their data storage system such that stored teletype messages could be transferred to and from the satellite at a 55-kbps rate."}
