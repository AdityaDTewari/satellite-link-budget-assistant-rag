The microwave antennas were circularly polarized biconical horns with nominally onmidirectional patterns about the spin axis to prevent amplitude modulation. Vertical coverage (in the plans of the spin axis) extended from 40 to 115 degrees (-1 dB points). In addition, this particular antenna system provided decoupling between the two trans­ mitters and receiver of the spacecraft without any switches, thereby reducing losses and increasing reliability. Further details on the microwave antenna can be found in Appendix 7-A. The VHF antenna consisted of 4 monopoles extending out from the bottom mounting ring face of the spacecraft. For command reception the antenna elements were fed in phase to produce a dipole-like pattern; while for telemetry and tracking transmission they were fed pairwise in phase quadrature to produce a circularly polarized wave in the plane perpendicular to thespin axis. In any planes parallel to the spin axis the wave was linearly polarized. All spacecraft power was generated by solar"}
