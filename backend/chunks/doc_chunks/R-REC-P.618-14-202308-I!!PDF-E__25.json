At some locations, ionospheric scintillation may be important at frequencies below about 6 GHz (see Recommendation ITU-R P.531). 2.3.1 Decrease in antenna gain due to wave -front incoherence Incoherence of the wave -front of a wave incident on a receiving antenna is caused by small -scale irregularities in the refractive index structure of the atmosphere. Apart from the rapid signal fluctuations discussed in § 2.4, they cause an antenna -to-medium coupling loss that can be described as a decrease of the antenna gain. Rec. ITU-R P.618 -14 17 This effect increases both with increasing frequency and decreasing elevation angle, and is a function of antenna diameter. Although not explicitly accounted for in the refraction models presented below, this effect is negligible in comparison. 2.3.2 Beam spreading loss The prediction method for Earth -to-space and space -to-Earth beam spreading loss is given in Recommendation ITU -R P.834. 2.4 Scintillation and multipath fading The amplitude of tropospheric scintillations depends on the magnitude and structure of the refractive index variations along the propagation path. Amplitude scintillations increase with frequency and with the path length, and decrease as the antenna beamwi dth decreases due to aperture averaging. Measured data shows the monthly -averaged r.m.s. fluctuations are well -correlated with the wet term of the radio refractivity, Nwet, which depends on the water vapour content of the atmosphere. There are three parts of the method of predicting the fading due to amplitude scintillation: 1) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading at free -space elevation angles  5° (§ 2.4.1). 2) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation fading for fades  25 dB (§ 2.4.2). 3) Prediction of the amplitude scintillation in"}
