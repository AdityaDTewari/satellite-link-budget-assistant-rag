In summary, then, theresultant modification oftheR-Hmodel is: Tt(R)ITltexp(-R/Rlt/ Tstexp(-4_/'l_/Rst) (Tit+T2t)exp(-R/Rt')R>30mm/h 5mm/h_R_<30mrn/h R<5mm/h (3.3-15) forlminsts60min. and =tTltexp(-R/Rlt) R>tRcTt(R) (Tit+T2t)exp(-R/Rt') R<Rc fort>60min.(3.3-16) 3.3.2Additions totheRainModel Dutton (1977)hasestimated thevariance andconfidencelevels ofthe rain rate prediction, andDougherty andDutton (1978) have estimated the year-to-year variability ofrainfall within agiven rain zone. Extendingtherainmodel toinclude attenuation onearth-space paths, Dutton (1977) hasassumed theMarshall andPalmer(1948) raindrop distribution. Hehasalso included somedegree ofmodeling ofrainfall inthe horizontal direction.This isachieved bymeans ofwhat istermed the \"probability modification factor\" onearth-space links. Theprobability modification factor, F,isgiven by (f/15)2 F_A(-T_T,e) (0.2748+ 0.987) thefactor cannot exceed unity, however. GHz,'(3.3-17) In(3.3-17),fisthefrequency in 8istheelevation angle tothesatelliteindegrees,andA(f,e) isthe 55 path attenuation indB.Theform wasderived from rain storm cell size data given inaparticularly useful form byRogers (1972). TheRogers data, however, were alltaken inthevicinity ofMontreal, Canada. Itwould be desirable tohavemore globally diverse data inorder toderive amore general probability modification factor. Theprobability modification factor, applied strictly toattenuation, multiplies thepercent oftime, Po,during anaverage year that apoint rainfall rate isexpected atagiven location. Themultiplied value represents thepercent oftime, P,(PsPo),that attenuation corresponding toRoisexpected along thepath toasatellite. Thus, ineffect, a point-to-path rain rate conversion, accounting forhorizontal inhomogeneity is developed: IntheDDmodel thesurface rainfall rate istranslated into liquid water content perunit volume, Lo,accumulating attheground. Theliquid water content atSome height, h,above theground, L(h), canbemodeled asa function ofLo(Dutton -1971). Themodeling ofL(h) isdifferent forthe stratiform andconvective rain systems. Inthestratiform modeling L(h) is assumed constant totherain-cloud base, then decreases tozero atthestorm topheight H.Intheconvective modeling L(h) increases slightly tothe rain-cloud base andthen decreases tozero atH. Attenuation perunitlength, _(f,h), duetorain canbecalculated from L(h) viaexpressions oftheform o(f,h)=a(f)[L(h)] b(f) (3.3-18) using thedata ofCrane (1966). Hence, thedistinction between theRayleigh region (f<10GHz, approximately) andtheMieregion (f>lOGHz) isimplicit in(4.3-25), because thecoefficients a(f) andb(f) arefrequency dependent. IntheRayleigh region, itcanbeshown that b(f)=l."}
