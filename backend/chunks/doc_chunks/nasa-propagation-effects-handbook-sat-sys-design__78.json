TheCCIR approximation (4.3-27) isshownontheplot forthetilt angles 21°and450.Inthis case, theCCIR approximation appears tounderestimate thedepolarization. 4.3.5 Phase ofCrosspolarized Signal Techniques havebeendevelopedforcompensating fordepol arization in dual-polarized satellite systems. They involve cancelling thecrosstalk in onechannel byinserting aproperly levelledandphased sample oftheopposite channel's signal. Thesignal sample used forcancelling must beexactly 180ooutofphase from thecrosspolarized signal forthetechnique towork. Itseffectiveness depends, therefore, onhowwell thecontrol system can determine andtrack thephase ofthecrosspolarized signal.

BTLCOMSTAR Depolarization Experiment Results (Arnold, et.al. -1979) 144 Estimating theperformance ofcrosstalk cancellation systems isone motivation forinvestigating crosspolarized signal phase. Another reason is that thesignal phase issensitive tocertain properties oftherainmedium (e.g. canting angle), anditsmeasurement canaidinmodelling thepropagation properties ofrain phenomena. Overstreet andBostian (1978) atVPIandSUderived atheoretical description ofthephase between thecopolarized andcrosspolarized signals when rain depolarization ispresent. They assumed identically oriented raindrops, canted atanangle 0with respect toacopolarized reference direction, having known differential attenuation andphase andaknown effective path length. Using Chu's differential attenuation andphase values forthefrequencies andelevation angles oftheCTSandCOMSTAR D-2beacons, they predicted thephase asafunction of0andrain rate, then found phase versus theXPDvalue forthesame rain rate. Thepath lengths usedwere derived from attenuation •statistics forthose beacons attheVPIandSU station. Forlinearly polarized signals atIIand28GHz, itwasfound that thephase wasafairly weak function ofXPDand0,typically remaining with a 450sector forXPDvalues downto15dBover theexpected range of0.For circular polarization, itwasfound that thephase difference Acisgiven by Ac:+_28+At(O=45°) (4.3-30) where A_isthephase difference forLPwaves, andthesign ofthefirst term depends onwhether RHCP orLHCP iscopolarized.
