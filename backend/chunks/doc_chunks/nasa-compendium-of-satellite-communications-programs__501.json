Margins at all other stations are 0.1 to 2.'7 dB higher than those shown in the table. Since reliability of communications is of paramount importance, margins are allowed for unpredictable losses:due to weather, power control, misalignments, and equipment degradation. Control of the NATO SATCOM Phase IIsystem is provided in a number of dif­ ferent areas. These are spacecraft control, earth terminal complex (ground) con­ trol, and communications or traffic control. Table 16-3 shows the operating frequencies for the 2-MHz and 20-MHz channels. 1. Spacecraft control is exercised by the USAF Satellite Control Facility (AFSCF), Sunnyvale, California, through its worldwide network of satel­ lite monitoring facilities. The satellite control system receives and processes telemetry data and generates and transmits commands for the, control of the spacecraft. Spacecraft control includes altitude control, station keeping and other command functions of the space segment. Con­"}
