This orbit will result in a fat figure-eight ground track, will provide polar coverage, and will enhance the satellites' survivability by making them harder to locate and track.(3 a) The system will employ frequency hopping spread­ spectrum techniques to combat enemy jamming.

Table 9-1. X-Band Experiment Objectives Number, Description 1 Investigate X-Band Satellite Communications Performance 2 Display Operation of Solid-State X-Band Transponders 3 Investigate Despun Anternas, 4 Evaluate Autonomous Satellite Attitude Control 5 Study Space' adiation Environment 6 Demonstrate Efficient Error Correcting Coding-Decoding Techniques 7 Investigate Minimum Data Rates for Voice Signal Transmission 8 Study Multiple Access Techniques with no Stringent Synchronization Requirements 9-2 Three X-band satellites have been launched during the LES program as indicated in Table 9-2 ( 4 ) (5). LES-1 was correctly injected, by its launch vehicle, into an -inclined medium altitude circular orbit. However, a design flaw inrthe satellite's ordnance circuity prevented ignition and separation of the rocket motor supplied for final orbit injection. This left the combination in the medium altitude circular orbit instead of a 2, 778 by 14, 816 km (1500 by 8000 nautical mile) inclined elliptical orbit as planned. At separation from the launch vehicle, the satellite-rocket motor com­ bination was spun up about the axis of least inertia to 180 rpm. When the rocket motor failed to separate, spin axis conversion immediately started to occur. Before it was completed, .a few initial commun ications tests were conducted.
