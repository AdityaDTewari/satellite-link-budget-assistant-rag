As of mid-1974, this new industry has evolved to the point where it serves a major portion of the world's population. The most dramatic illustration of this service is real-time television coverage of major inter­ national events, allowing Ifiillions to literally be \"on-the-spot\" to view such activities as the Olympic games and official state visits of world political and religious leaders. Numerous programs have contributed toward the evolution of satellite communications over the past 15 years and much has been written about them. The primary objectives of this compendium are to summarize the.major con­ tributions of each program and to compile an extensive bibliography of the publicly available writings on them. The compendium, first issued in 1971, sponsored by Communications Programs, Office of Applications, was assembled by the -Computer Sciences Corporation (Contract NAS 5-2f522) under the direc­ tion of the Communications and Navigation Division, Goddard Space Flight Cen­ ter, National"}
