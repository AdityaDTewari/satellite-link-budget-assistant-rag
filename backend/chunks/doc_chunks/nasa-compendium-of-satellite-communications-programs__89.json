S. Army Signal Research and Development Lab­ oratory (USASRL) submitted a technical proposal for a delayed repeater satellite communication system to the-Advanced Research and Development Agenc of the Defense Department. In October 1958, USASRL received approval to proceed with Project. Courier. The program was undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility and operational capabilities of a store-and-forward (information storage for future retrieval) satellite communications system with potential military application. (1) Two active delayed repeater, satellites, Courier Ia and Ib, were launched before this program was completed,- asindicated in Table 4-1. (2) After Courier Ia failed to reach orbit due to a missile malfunction, Courier Ib was successfully injected into a low altitude eliptic-al-oibit. Testing during the 1-7-day operational lifetime of Courier Ib fulfilled the program objectives. The operational usefulness of Courier Ib came to an end when it ceased to respond to attempts at \"turn on.\" Table 4-1.
