Several experimental data points areshown, but these donotcorrelate well with the theory (possibly because ofthepolarization dependence of_). Theimportant results ofthese figures arethat _increases with increasing frequency, while appears toberelatively constant. Intherelation XPD=)-_loglO(A) this would imply that theXPDincreases with increasing frequency, butbecause oftherapid increase inAwith frequency, XPDwill actually decrease for increasing frequency andmoderate rain rates. Chu(1980)hasfound linear relations between theXPDandfrequency throughout the10to30GHzfrequency range. Specifically, XPD(expressed as anumericalratio) isdirectly proportional tofrequency forafixed rain rate, andisinversely proportional tofrequency forafixed value ofrain attenuation. Bostian (1979b) confirms this linear relation between the XPD(fl) andXPD(f 2)from hismonthly COMSTAR data for1978, but,the value XPD(f2)/XPD(fl) varies from month tomonth. 6.7.2.3Elevation AngleDependence ofDepolarization. IntheU.S. andCanada depolarization measurements have been obtainedatelevation angles from 24.6o inOttawa (McEwan-1977) to49oatAustin, Texas (Vogel-1978). Thegeneral dependenceofXPDversus Aonelevation angle ecanbeobtained from the theoretical results ofNowland, etal(1977a). Note that both thecoefficient aandthetotal attenuation Adepend onelevation angle. Theelevation angle dependent results ofNowland, etal(1977b) 11.7 GHz(experimentaldata) areshowninFigure 6.7-4. Clearly the coefficient iselevation angle dependent, however theexperimental data does notconfirm this fact. The_coefficient appears tobenearly independent of elevation angle anddoes appear toagree with thelimited data base. Chu(1980) hasobservedthat thedifferential propagation constant fordepolarization isgoverned byacos2e relation. However theXPD dependenceonelevation angle must also take theeffective path lengtheffect into account (Chu-1974). 315 60 FREQ.- 11GHz OEXPERIMENTAL, 11.7GHz POLARIZATION -RHCP _ DATAOFNOWLAND, etal .... 4.3 CANTING ANGLE DISTRIBUTION, XXUSINGLe12_2R m,=0.84 []''\"0 CCIR(PROPOSED) _ 50 . =f .77 w, 3o I I J 0 20 40 60 80 ELEVATION ANGLE (DEGREES)!;. i _,.. 25 N eL X' z_< (b)_3=o < > lSm m m mud ! m mud i m,m 0(SAMEASABOVE) BLACKSBURG, VA O mm maulumqullm quup Ul_ anllm qulam m aimOlin m amqm | B_CKSBURG, VA OAUSTIN, TEXAS •-\"......\"_\"0\"\"_'O'\"- ......-_\"......._.A OTTAWA OBLACKSBURG, VA 19_ I I I I 20 40 60 80 ELEVATION ANGLE(DEGREES) Figure 6.7-4 ElevationAngle Dependence oftheCoefficientsinthe"}
