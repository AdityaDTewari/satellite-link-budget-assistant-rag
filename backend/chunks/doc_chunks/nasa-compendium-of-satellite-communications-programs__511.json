NATO Ground Terminal Simplified Block Diagram * The transmitter instantaneous bandwidth should be as large as possible Klystrons with a bandwidth of 250 MHz may become available in the 1975-1980 period. * The redundant transmitters should be capable of being operated in parallel so that their combined power can be used. 16.5 EXPERIMENTS The repeater performance, which is crucial to the performance of the system, has been measured in orbit by means of the special earth station test facilities at SRDE (Christchurch, U.K.) and the SHAPE Technical Center (STC), The Hague. No significant change was observed from the performance measured by Philco-Ford in the laboratory prior to launch. In general, the NATO satellite system is tobe an operational system, not an experimental one. Tests and evaluations are made only to the extent of assuring operational capabilities. Such tests have been successful in showing the feasibility of using satellite communications in support of NATO operations. 16.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS NATO Phase I, a test and evaluation system, is no longer operational. A sub­ sequent Phase II system was implemented to provide an operational system during the 1971-1974 time period although only one of two satellites in space remains opera­ tional and has been placed in a ready"}
