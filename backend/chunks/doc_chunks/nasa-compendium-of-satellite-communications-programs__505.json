Figure 16-2 shows the coverage of the WB and NB antennas. The WB antenna will be pointed to 42N latitude and 18°W longitude to concentrate the power in the geographical area of interest to NATO, as in the case of the Phase II satellite. Under this concept, all transmissions from ground stations will-be received by the satellite WB antenna. However, the satellite-downlink transmissions will be routed through the satellite WB antenna repeater or NB antenna repeater depending on the radio frequency transmitted by the ground station. The filters installed in the satellite receiver will be set to accept that frequency assigned to the WB or NB. All terminals in the European area will receive the satellite NB downlink transmissions while those in the Atlantic will receive only the WB downlink trans­ missions. The increased gain of the NB antenna will result in the NB channel having about 3-1/3 times the EIRP of the WB channel. This increased power will meet the larger SATCOM requirements in the European area. Figure 16-3 shows the 188 links to be provided between the 22 fixed station terminals and shows the fixed stations to be equipped to handle shipshore communi­ cations. Each link will be equipped to handle voice, data and teletype channels by FM modulation as needed to meet requirements in a no-jamming environment. Also, each link will be equipped with CDMA and TDM equipment to handle up to one vocoded voice or data at 2400 bps and/or several teletype channels under jamming conditions. Table 16-7 summarizes the links and channels"}
