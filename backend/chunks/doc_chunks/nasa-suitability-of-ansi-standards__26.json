The Access OutageProbability, along with theTransfer Denial Probability discussed below gives anindication ofsystem availability andtherefore, isincluded in thesetofDAMA system performanceparameters. 3.2.2 User Information Transfer Theuser information transfer forallTDMA systems ishandled thesame way asforanyconnectlon-oriented digital communication system,Thepath through thesystem fortheuser's data does notchangefortheduration ofthecall. However,theparameters areaffected differently bythevarious TDMA systems, andnotallparameters pertain toallsystems. BitError Probability Bit Error Probability istheprobability that atransmitted bitwill be received inerror. This isthe same asPeused inlink performance measurements andlink budget calculations oftypes AandBsatellite syste.,,s. AsBit Error Probability isone ofthe most: zommon measures ofdigital communication system performance, itisincluded inthe setofTDMA system performance parameters. BitMisdellvery Probability Bit Misdel_.very Probability isthe probabillty that asingleuser information bitisdelivered tothewrong destination. Inconnectlon-orlented systems, likethevarious TDMA systems discussed, user information bitsfollow only onepath through thesystem.Also, asTDMA systems process theuser data inmultibit subbursts, itisunlikely that asingle bit would bemisrouted. Therefore, Bit Misdelivery Probability isnot included intheset ofTDMA system performance parameters. 301989010985-040 BitLoss Probability The BitLoss Probability istheprobability that auser information bit entering the system does notreach theintended destination. Again, asTDMA systems areconnection-oriented, user information bits have only onepath to follow. However, ifthe TDMA frame-synchronizing unique word (UW) isnot detected for asignificant number offrames, the local terminal clock will begin todrift, causing theframe boundaries toshift and theTDMA control buff_ tooverflow, thus loosing user data bits. (Feher i1983] discusses uniqueword detection andprobabilities ofmissesandfalse alarms.) Also,if theuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe earth station clock, a \"clock sllp\" can occur.This iswhen theclock reading data out ofaTDMA buffer differs from"}
