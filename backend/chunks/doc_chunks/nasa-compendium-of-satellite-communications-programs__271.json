The receiving system demodulates a single carrier, and the frame synchronization is now source oriented rather than destination oriented. Still another area of major concern to the INTELSAT program has been link pro­ pagation. Considerable detailed data on satellite link propagation characteristics at the 4-and 6-Hz frequencies has been obtained. This includes items such as atmos­ pheric absorption as a function of weather conditions; scintillation and faraday r6tation as functions of time, geographic location, and sunspot activity; and maultipath as a function of antenna elevation angle. As the geostationary orbit has tended to fill up with satellites operating at 4 and 6 GHz, INTELSAT has become interested in link 10-52 propagation characteristics for spacecraft communications systems operating at fre­ quencies above 10 GHz. This interest is evidenced in the Cofrsat propagation-experi­ ment to be conducted at 13 and 18 GHz by NASA's ATS-6 satellite. This experiment is designed to gather data on satellite signal attenuation at 13 and 18 GHz caused by atmospheric hydrometeors at ground stations located in representative climatological areas. The data obtained from this experiment will provide the basis. for establishing minimum power margins needed for operation at 13 and 18 GHz. 10. 6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Since the INTELSAT program has produced a commercial communications sys­ tem, the system's operational results obtained during each of the four generations of the space subsystem are of considerable interest., Early Bird was launched on April 6, 1965, and by April 22 it was sufficiently synchronized for the commence­ ment of communications testing. Two groups of tesis were conducted concomitantly: the Performance Test Plan to determine how well the spacecraft performance in orbit met contract specifications, and the Experimental, Test Plan to deternfine system parameters when the spacecraft is used with the'opeiating ground ,stations."}
