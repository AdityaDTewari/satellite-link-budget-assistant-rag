TV tele-consultation in which doctors at VA hospitals consult with specialists, at teaching institutions. Patients and clinical material- may be televised. 4. Computer-assisted instruction in which physicians and staffers will par­ ticipate in programmed instruction mediated by computer, including history-taking, diagnosis and management of various clinical problems. 5. Slow-scan, using signals that dd ndt require wiffeband transmission. TV transmission will include such items as electrocardiograms, and X-rays. VA physicians will be able to obtain specialist consultation in making diagnoses.

Health Education Telecommunications Experiment Veterans Administration's Exchange of Medical Information Program Applications Technology Satellite-F (42 ) 13.4.5.7 Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) This is a joint experiment by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization of India, by an agreement entered into September 18, 1969. Its central objec­ tive is to demonstrate the potential value of a direct broadcast TV system for edu­ cation purposes, primarily in rural and remote areas, using a geosynchronous SITE. Thb Governments of India and the US are cooperating in the Instructional Television experiment. After ATS-F has been in orbit communications spacecraft in conjunc- -one year, the spacecraft wilt be moved from its original position at 94 degrees, west longitude to 35 degrees east-longitude. Thrusters wlocated on.the truss structure will propel it to a new location at a rate tion with low-cost ground"}
