IftheMCScannot process thecall request, therequest isignored and theoriginating user will eventually abandon thecall. User Blocking Signal AUser Blocking Signal isissued when thedestinationuser iseither busy (the originating user receives a\"busy tone\") ordoes notanswer.Asdefined inANSI (1983),acall attempt blocked bythedestination user isexc]uded from thesystem performance measurements. i !1989010985-071 Start ofBlockInput ToSystem The Start ofBlockInput toSystemoccurs when the first bit ofuser information crosses theoriginating user/systeminterface. Themeasurement of access time isstopped when this event occurs. Start ofBlockTransfer Because theACTS LBR system isconnection-oriented, the Start ofBlock Transfer coincides with the Start ofBlock Input tothe system. The measurement ofblock transfer time isstarted when this event occurs. EndofBlock Transfer The End ofBlock Transfer occurs when the last bit oftheuser-defined information block crosses the destination user/system interface. The measurement ofblock transfer time isstopped when this event occurs. Disengagement Request ADisengagement Request occurs when either theoriginating ordestination user signals his/her earth station todisconnect thecall. Theearth station then formats and transmits acircuit disconnect message via theinbound order wire totheMCS. Theearth station originating thedisconnect request waits for con[irmation from the MCS before taking any further action. If confirmation does not arrive before atime out expires, the earth station retransmits the circuit disconnect message. The first Disengagement Request issued signifies thestart ofthedisengagement time measurement. Disengagement Confirmation Upon reception ofacircuit disconnect message, the MCS determines the validity oftherequest bychecking its list ofactive circuits forthe one identified inthedisconnect message. Ifthecircuit isonthelist, theMCS sends adisconnect acknowledgment message viatheoutbound order wire toboth earth stations using the circuit. Ifthe circuit isnot onthe list, the circuit disconnect message isdiscarded. TheDisengagement Confirmation allows both users toplace other calls. The measurement ofdisengagement time is stopped when the user making the originaldisengagement request isable to pla__.other ca]is. 6219890109R5-077 4.3.3Typical ACTSLBRSession Theabovereference events areextremely useful fordeveloping call session profiles.
