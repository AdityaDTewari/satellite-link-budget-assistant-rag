Acquisition was achieved automatically using time and frequency predictions obtained from a station clock and the satellite ephemeris. The desired synchronization was achieved by transmission of a synchronizing pulse (i. e., a 200-i s pulse that is frequency hopped Wiut carries no information) every 5 ms. A tracking loop integrated over many of these pulses in sequency to achieve the desired timing and frequency accuracies of 5 As and 625-Hz, respectively. 9-8 Table 9-5.
