(See Figure6,4-I.)Inatypical foglayer 50mthick, apathata 300elevation angle would beinthefogonly 100m,producing less than 0.1 dBofattenuation at95GHz. This suggeststhat fogattenuation would, in most cases, benegligible. 6.4.3.3EstimatingFogAttenuation.

Todate simulated measurements have been carried outinthelaboratory (Ahmed andAuchterlouis-1976). At10GHzand concentrations ofsand anddust lessthan 10-5g/m3themeasured specific attenuation waslessthan 0.1dB/km forsand and0.4dB/km forclay. Severe storms have concentrations exceeding these values. Ghobrial, etal(1978) have calculated atheoretical specific attenuation forsand. Based onthecharacteristics ofparticles collected during sandstorms, they conclude that negligible attenuation issuffered by X-band transmissions through sandstorms. This isduetothesmall particle size compared tothewavelength andthelowloss tangent forsand. Blowing sandandduststormsoccurinsomeregions oftheU.S. These arerecorded bytheWeather Service aspart oftheLocal Climatological Data (LCD) atthe291:stations. Ground stations needing this information should review thedata recorded byanearbyLCDrecording station. Thevertical extent ofthese sandstormsisunknown, butitseems unlikely that high concentrations would exceed 1km. Thepath length is expected tovary between 1/2and3 km,generally resulting inatotal additional attenuation duetosand oftheorder of1dBorless. Nomeasured satellite beacon linkdata isavailable toconfirm these results. 6.5 PREDICTION OFPATH DIVERSITY FOREARTH-SPACE PATHS 6.5.1TheDiversityConcept 6.5.1.1PathDiversity. Rain attenuation often degradesearth-space paths operating above 10GHzsoseriously that therequirements ofeconomical design andreliable performance cannot beachieved simultaneously. Toovercome this problem, Hogg (1968) proposed theuseofpath diversity onearth-space paths toachieve thedesired level ofsystemreliability atareasonable cost compromise. This proposal wasbased onthehypothesis that rain cells and, in particular, theintense rain cells that cause themost severe fading are 254 .... .......... •..... •.................. :., • ........................ o, rather limited inspatial extent.
