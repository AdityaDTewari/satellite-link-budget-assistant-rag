For the 120-channel multiplex system to be used for the first commercial service, it was necessary to allow 4 weeks for ad­ justments at a circuit level both in the U. S. and in the four countries in Europe. These tests were completed on schedule, and the system was ready for operation in June. After a series of successful demonstrations with telephone circuits and tele­ vision service, commercial operation was initiated on June 28, 1965. Figure 10-8 summarizes commercial usage for telephone and television traffic through November 1967. The satellite contribution to out-of-service time was zero in the Early Bird system. All loss of service was attributable to the seven major earth segment elements--the five earth stations and the U.S. and European interconnects. The re­ liability history of this service through early 1967 is shown in Figure 10-9 in terms of cumulative percentage outage time. Early Bird was placed in retired reserve on January 20, 1969, after INTELSAT III achieved operational status. It was reactivated for a brief period between June 1969 and August 1969 when temporary difficulties were encountered with the despun antenna of an INTELSAT III satellite. The operational lifetime of 3-1/2 years far exceeded the design lifetime of 1-1/2 years for this ex­ ceptionally successful satellite program. The first INTELSAT II satellite (F-i) was launched in October 1966. Although it failed to achieve stationary orbit, the successful functioning of the communications subsystem permitted an 8-hour-per-day voice service to be established between the earth stations in Hawaii and Brewster Flat. The highly elliptical, inclined orbit realized reduced the commercial utility of the F-1 satellite to negligible proportions, but the experience with its functioning subsystem proved to be invaluable in preparing 10-54 130 NO.FO CHAANNL- TV HOURS 140 -EARLY BIRD"}
