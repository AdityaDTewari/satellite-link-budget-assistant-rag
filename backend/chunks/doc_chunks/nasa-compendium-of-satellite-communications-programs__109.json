In measuring orbital parameters, rms deviations normal to the orbital plane averaging 7.5 km and rms deviations'in geocentric radius averaging 9.5 km were observed. The average nodkl period during the first 720 revolutions (the first 80 days of belt life) was found to be 166.455 minutes. From this nodal period the average semimajor axis during this interval was computed to be 1. 57 earth radii. All three physical'measurement approaches were employed in determining belt dimensions. Typical results of these measurements are summarized in Figure 5-3. In this figure, perigee and semi-latus-rectum points are marked and each point on the chart indicates the data sources, the 3-rB in-plane dimension and, except for the inferences from doppler measurements, the 3-dB out-of~plane dimension. Experimental estimates of the number of dipoles in orbit indicated that between 16 and 39 percent of the ejected dipoles were properly dispensed. It alsd appeared that occasionally more than one center of density developed, so that two closely spaced dipole belts were present. This situation is depicted in Figure 5-4. Measurement of the propagation characteristics of the belt was one of the goals of the second experimental program. The dipole belt provided a channel in which sig­ nals were communicated from one point to another by scattering"}
