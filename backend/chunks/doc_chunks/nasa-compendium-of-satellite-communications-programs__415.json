While the telemedicine experiment will build on the work begun in Alaska with ATS-1, the second objective--health education--involves a consortium of four 13-101 states: Washington, Alaska; Montana, and Idaho. t Only Washingtonpresently has a medical school. 13.4.5.5.1 Telemedicine The experiment in telemedicine will be. conducted3 at five sites in Alaska. The examining rooms in the small clinics at Fort Yukon (population 630) and Galena (popu­ lation 425) will be equipped with \"comprehensive\" earth stations for sending andre­ ceiving video, voice, physiological information, and records data. The medics and health aides at these blinids will present patients to the viewing physicians-at the Public Health Service Hospital in Tanana. This site is also equipped with a compre­ hensive terminal. Consultation with specialists will be available from Fairbanks (with a comprehensive terminal) and the Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC)' at Anchorage. The latter will have what is called an \"intensive\" terminal--equipment similar to the others, but without the capability to transmit video. Medical record data can be transmitted' and received via ATS-1 satellite from all sites. In actual operation, Tanana physicians will call the villages and clinicsvia ATS-1 to discuss medical problems with the health and medics as they have been doing for the past two years. Patients in the clinics who might benefit from visual consultation will be scheduled for ATS-6 time. Prior to visual consultation, the patient's medical records will be retrieved via ATS-1 from the Indian Health Service Health Information System (HIS) computer in Tucson, Arizona. The patient then will be \"seen\" by the Tanana physician and.therapy prescribed. During presentationof the patient, physiological information such as EKGo and heartbeat may be sent simul­ taneously via one or more of the four aural channels associated with the televised picture. Talk-back to the presenting clinics will be accomplished via"}
