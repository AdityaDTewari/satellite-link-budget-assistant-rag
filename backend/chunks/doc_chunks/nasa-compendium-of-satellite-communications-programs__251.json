Among the most significant changes were the adoptidn of a single redundant wideband linear amplifier and an antenna beam that covered both the northern and southern hemispheres. The transponder bandwidth was 125 MHz compared with the two re­ peaters of 25-MHz bandwidth, each used in Early Bird. A block diagram of the INTELSAT 11 satellite's communications system is shown in Figure 10-2. To main­ tain the 240-circuit capacity of Early Bird, in spite of the wider antenna beamwidth, INTELSAT II employed multiple traveling-wave tubes operating in parallel. Four tubes were included in anticipation that three would be required to meet the EIRP re­ quirements, leaving one tube as a spare. However, the antenna and power efficiencies achieved were such that a two-tube configuration was adequate. The additional power required by INTELSAT H was provided by using a larger solar cell array. In con­ trast to Early Bird, INTELSAT II was designed to support communication through the 10-27 EARLY BIRD X3 HYBRID 12Bfo X2 (FREQUENCIES IN PARENTHESIS ARE FOR REPEATER 2) 0 f.0 = FREQUENCY MASTER OSCILLATOR 1IF -FREQUENCY INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY X32 t 384fm 1 60 256f,, MASTER OSCILLATOR 16.4855 MHz (16.2219 MHz) 00o 0t TM ENCODER I X5) (XS) F DECODER A LIMODULATOR NVAMPLIFIERTW I • BSfm O3f.)
