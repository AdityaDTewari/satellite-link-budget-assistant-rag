The major characteristics of the Phase I earth ter­ minals are found in corresponding Paragraph 12.4. Modifications and additions being made to these terminals and the major charabteristics of the new terminals are sub­ sequently discussed. Table 17-4 summarizes the modifications and additions by stages and Table 17-5 portrays the major characteristics of the forthcoming new terminals. 17.4.1 AN/FSC-9 Terminals The two AN/FSC-9 terminals were rehabilitated and upgraded during 1970 and 1971 by STRATCOM under contract to the Philco-Ford Corporation. These modifica­ tions ensure compatibility with Phase H Stage la. Frequency compatibility was achieved by procuring new crystals. Frequency synthesizers will be used for the subsequent stages and for providing the proper frequency increments to change transmit and re­ ceive frequencies in 1-kHz steps over the entire satellite transmit and receive bands. Other modifications will provide a multiple transmit and receive carrier capability. This modification will allow the AN/FSC-9 to handle the following number of signals pending the particular nodal carrier requirements at each location: 1. Transmit FM/FDMA -Up to three uplink RF carriers SSMA -Up to seven SS carriers using a common RF frequency 2. Receive FM/FDMA -Up to seven downlink RF carriers SSMA -Up to seven SS carriers using a common RF frequency Beacon -One signal on its own RF carrier frequency 17-13 Table 17-4.
