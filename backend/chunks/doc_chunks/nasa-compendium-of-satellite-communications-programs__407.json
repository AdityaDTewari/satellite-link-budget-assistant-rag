The comprehensive terminal is an intensive terminal with added transmission equipment which gives the user the ability to receive and originate full video, audio, and data. Hewlett-Packard, Hughes Aircraft, -Prodelin, and Westinghouse are all involved in developing equipment under contract for the ATS-6 health and education experi­ ments. 13.4.5 Experiments The ATS-6 spacecraft is scheduled to perform over 20 technological and sci­ entific experiments as shown below. (42) Communication Experiments * Health -Education Telecommunications Experiment (HET) (6 Projects) * Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) * Television Relay Using Small Terminals (TRUST) * L-Band Exper'iment (also known as Position, Location and Aircraft Con­ trol Experimelt (PLACE)) * Tracking and Data Relay Experiment/Satellite-to-Satellite Experiment 13-89 Communications Technology Experiments * Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) C-band Experiment * Millimeter Wave Propagation Experiment (MWE) * COMSAT Propagation Experiment * Spacecraft Attitude Precision Pointing and Slewing Adaptive Control Ex­ periment * Radio Beacon Experiment Additional Technological Experimentation * Very High Resolution Radiometer Experiment * Cesium Bombardment Ion Engine Experiment * Advanced Thermal Control Flight Experiment * Environmental Measurements Experiments (EME) * International Magnetospheric Relay Experiment Special Investigations * Spacecraft Vibration Accelerometer * Quartz Crystal Microbalance Contamination Monitor * Television Camera * Interferometer High Data Rate Acquisition System Since its near perfect orbit achieved with the -Martin Marietta Titan III C Tran­ stage left ATS-6 with enough hydrazine propellant for an extra year's operation, ad­ ditional experiments will most likely be deVeloped!but are yet to be published.
