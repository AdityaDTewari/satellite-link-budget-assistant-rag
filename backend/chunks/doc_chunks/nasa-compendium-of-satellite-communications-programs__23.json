Information, \"typically, included within each major subtopic is as follows: * Program Description -Project origin and objectives; spacecraft launch dates, orbital data, and status; extent to which program objectives were accomplished; participating ground terminals; sponsoring organizations; and significant results advancing the state-of-the-art in satellite communi­ ,cations. 1-2 * System Description -Ground terminal linking, extent of spacecraft visi­ bilities, operating frequencies, signal processing including. modulation and multiple access, system control, and calculated link performance. * Spacecraft -Major characteristics of antennas and communications re­ peaters; general satellite features including stabilization, prime power, size and weight; and communications repeater block diagram. Major on­ board experiments not directly communications -related are listed but-not described in detail. * Ground Terminals -Major characteristics of antennas, receive system, transmitter, tracking system and physical installation; block diagram of principal subsystems; and any unique aspects. * Experiments -Definition of major types of experiments, summary of pri­ mary experimental results, and descriptions of significant demonstrations and public relations highlights. * Operational Results -Summary of operational traffic handled, plus opera­ tional performance and reliability of the satellites and ground terminals. 1.2 OVERVIEW OF PROGRAMS Major events, in each of the programs reviewed in this document, are summa9 rized as a function of time in Figure 1-1. The programs illustrated encompass all significant satellite communication activities involving orbiting hardware since the launching of the Score satellite, with the possible exception of Project Oscar. Several active repeater satellites, nicknamed \"Oscar,\" have been launched, starting as far back as late 1961 by the U. S. Air Force, to provide amateur radio communi­ cations satellites for use by \"Ham radio\" operators throughout the world. Some of these satellites were very short-lived and they, by intent, did"}
