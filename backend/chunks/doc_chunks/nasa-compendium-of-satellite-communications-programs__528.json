This group of earth ter­ minals is provided with transmit carrier power monitoring equipment to control its own transmit signal power. Modifications to the AN/MSC-46 tracing receivers will permit tracking the biphase modulated beacon signal from the satellite. Four of these earth terminals will also receive the capability to demodulate and provide alphanumeric readout of the beacon data (telemetry). Two of these AN/MSC-46 earth terminals will receive spectrum analyzers to monitor the satellite downlink frequencies. In Stage lb seven of the AN/MSC-46 will receive additional up and down con­ verters to provide a multiple carrier capability as nodal terminals. Both the up and down converters will interface at 70 MHz. The multiple carrier modification will per­ nit these terminals to handle. signals indicated in Paragraph 17.4.1. The remaining Phase I terminals not slated for nodal service and which were not modified in Stage la -will be modified to provide a paramp instantaneous bandwidth of 500 MHz spectrum analyzers and CNR meters. 17.4.3 AN/TSC-54 Crystals will also be provided to all the AN/TSC-54 terminals to achieve fre­ quency compatibility with Phase ]H. During Stage ib, synthesizers will be added. Stage la modification will further include equipping these terminals with new uncooled paramps capable of receiving within a 500-MHz bandwidth. The AN/TSC-54 terminal modifications are designed to fulfill two Stage 1 missions. The terminals will be equipped to handle up to 12 voice channels for DSCS trunking, using the EC satellite repeater channel. Additionally, the terminals will be used as contingency terminals employing the satellite NB channel. The contingency terminals will include 12 chan­ nels of self-contained multiplex equipment but will be able to handle a baseband con­ sisting of up to 72 channels. 17-18 17.4.4 New Terminals 17.4.4.1 AN/MSC-60, Heavy Transportable (HT) Table 17-5 presents major characteristics of"}
