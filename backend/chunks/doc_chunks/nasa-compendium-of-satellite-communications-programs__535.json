Although no experiments have been performed as such, an extensive evaluation program has been successfully conducted verifying the operational capabilities of the system under multi­ link conditions. 17.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS \"The first two DSCS spacecraft were launched in November 1971. Both space­ craft worked well for a limited period; however, one month after launch, a loss of power to the despun platform in the No. 2 spacecraft caused the despun platform to spin up and rotate at the same speed as the body of the spacecraft. Because of the imbalance of the despun platform, the spacecraft in this mode tipped 11 deg from its normal attitude. In this condition it was found that a complicated dynamics problem, not understood at the time of launch, resulted in an ultrastable minimum momentum vector configuration. The normal torque provided by the despun motor was insufficient to bring the spacecraft back to normal operation, i. e., to again despin the platform. Extensive analytical effort and many computer simulations uncovered the problem and finally enabled the re-erection of the spacecraft to an operational configuration. Fol­ lowing this successful operation, other deficiencies appeared in this spacecraft and it subsequently failed. The second spacecraft in this launch provided communications capability for a period ofmonths, but it finally failed due to a power distribution prob­ lem. Four spacecraft remain from this procurement and a major redesign activity was started to ensure that these spacecraft would operate properly. This redesign 17-25 included balancing of the despun platform and a"}
