The average received signal reduction iscalculated using thesame parameters required forcalculation oftheamplitude fluctuations. Using therelation in Section 6.6.2.2.4 (0.83 +0.17(0.84)) R=10lOglo 1.0=-0.12 dB 306 Thusduring clear weather this COMSTAR beaconwill ontheaverage be0.12dB below thevalue calculated considering clear airattenuation only.Thissame value could beestimated from Figure6.6-15. Thelong-term average distributioninFigure6.6-13 isnow constructed from2R andS2.Thepoint 2(15,9% point) isfound tobe 20(logloe) 1D-IS 1/20 =0.39 dBwhich isthestandarddeviation ofthe receiver voltage taken from asquarelawdetector. 6.7 PREDICTIONOFDEPOLARIZATION ONEARTH-SPACE PATHS 6.7.1 Introduction Depolarization refers tothat effect wherein anearth-spacewave's polarization isaltered inthetroposphere. Depolarization isalso referred toascross-polarization. Forlinearly polarizedwaves avertically (horizontally) polarized wave will, after passing through amedium, have a horizontally (vertically) polarized component inaddition totheinitial wave. Forcircularly polarizedwaves aRHCP (LHCP) wave will develop into an elliptical wave. Forfrequency reuse systemsbased onpolarization isolation this coupling reduces isolation andincreases \"cross-talk.\" 6.7.1.1 Sources ofDepolarization. Depolarization onearth-space paths has been observeddueinthepresence of •rain •ice •snow • multipath • refractive effects 307 Thesehydrometeor andscatteringeffects generate depolarization because of thenon-spherical shapes ofthehydrometer particles. Forexan_le, as raindrop sizesincrease their shape departs from spherical andbecomes an oblate spheroid with anincreasingly pronounced flat bottom. Forlarge drop sizes aconcave depression develops (Pruppacher andPitter-1971). Polarized microwave energy scattered from these particles caneasily beconverted into anorthogonal polarization.•/ i. 6.7.1.2Measures ofDepolarization. Themeasurement ofdepolarization by propagation researchers usually hasbeen done utilizing orthogonally-polarized feeds onasingle antenna while observing singly-polarized satellite signals. This parameter iscalled thecross-polarization discrimination (XPD) or cross-polarization ratio (XPR) defined as(Bostian, etai-1977) XPD=poweroutputfrom theco-polarized port power outputfrom thecross-polarized port =(XPR)-I Forperfect transmitting andreceiving antennas andaperfect medium this i_olation could become infinite, butwith practical components some leakage is always present."}
