After the HEW ATS-F User Policy Committee established the types and characteristics of terminals to be developed, the detailed specifications were written jointly by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Conmmica­ tions, NASA, and the Federation of Rocky Mountain States. A \"rbuilding block\" philosophy was adopted which would permit \"receive-only,\" \"intensive,\" and \"corn­ prehensive\" stations to be assembled from the basic development components. It was envisioned from the outset that these stations would be designed for operation solely by the health professionals and teachers. It Wvas inconceivable that the system could be cost effective in remote areas if it were necessary to have on hand a full­ time technician. The following are characteristics of the hardware: 1. Solid state throughout 2. No high voltages in the equipment 3. Relatively few circuit boards so that first level maintenance would con­ sist of plugging in boards until the defective one is found 13-88 4. Very few switches and adjustments 5. Simple go/no-go indications for critical voltages, signal levels, etc. 6. Low cost Z The basic station is the receive-only terminal' It consists of an external antenna and amplifier, and an indoor unit which contains the video and four-channel audio out­ put. The four audio channels may be used for voice, physiological information, and data for computer-aided instruction and evaluation. The intensive terminal is made up of a receive-only terminal plus the VHF transmit-receive equipment in use with the ATS-1 satellite network in Alaska. Thus the user'bf an intensive terminal'cannot only receive video and associated voice/data channels, but can .reply by voice. The comprehensive terminal is an intensive terminal with added transmission equipment which gives the user the ability to receive and originate full video, audio, and data.
