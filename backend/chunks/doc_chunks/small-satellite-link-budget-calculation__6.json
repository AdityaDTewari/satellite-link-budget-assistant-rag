In the middle latitudes scintillation occurs exceptionally, such as during geomagnetic storms. In the equatorial sector, there is a pronounced night-time maximum of activity Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 23/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsFriis formula Antennas Polarization Propagation HUMSAT-D: Atmospheric losses at 437 MHz Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum Elevation Latm(dB) Latm(dB) Lsci(dB) Lsci(dB) 5 0.02 0.22 0.02 0.37 10 0.02 0.11 0.02 0.16 15 0.02 0.08 0.02 0.1 Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 24/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio ConclusionsRadio Noise Antenna Noise Recommendation ITU-R P.372-12 Radio Noise The noise can be produced by: Radiation from lightning discharges Aggregated unintended radiation from electrical machinery, electrical and electronic equipments, power transmission lines, or from internal combustion engine ignition (man-made noise) Emissions from atmospheric gases"}
