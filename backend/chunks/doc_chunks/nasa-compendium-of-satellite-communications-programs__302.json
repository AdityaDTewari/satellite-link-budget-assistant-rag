Therefore, three Molniya satellites are sufficient to provide continuous coverage of the Soviet Union for the domestic 11-26 broadcast system. However, for purposes of redundancy, the Soviet Molniya-I sys­ tem appears to be an eight-satellite system consisting of four pairs of satellites spaced 6 hours apart. The system involves four orbital plans in an accurately placed cluster, 900 apart. This assures that two satellites (a pairj are continuously visible over the Moscow-Vladivostok- link, which is-their primary communications link. Very little current detail of the Molniya-2 satellite system is known. As seen from Paragraph 11. 2.2, the Soviets have filed a total of 21 operating frequencies for their satellite, 20 with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz and a downlink of 24. 5 dBW for each carrier. The twenty-first carrier was filed with a bandwidth of 40 MHz and a downlink ERP of 34.5 dBW. One of the channels (voice) is to be made available by the Soviets for the satellite direct communication link with the United States. The system employs FDM/FM/FDIVIA for frequency division multiplexing/frequency modulation/and multiple accessing. It has been shown that each of the two Molniya satellite systems operates on dif­ ferent frequency allocations. It is unlikely that the Orbita earth terminals for one system have a capability for operating with the other system although it is believed that each Orbita-2 terminal possesses both a transmit and receive capability. 11-27 CITED REFERENCES 1.
