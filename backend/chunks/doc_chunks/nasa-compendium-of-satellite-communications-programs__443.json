An additional accelerometer is mounted on the Titan III-C third stage for vertical movement sensing. The acceler­ ometers data will be telemetered to ground stations and delivered to Goddard for analysis. 13.4.5.17.2 Quartz Crystal Microbalance Contamination Monitor (GSFC) The objective of this experiment is to provide data on sources of possible con­ taminants on the spacecraft. This includes outgassing, ejecta from the spacecraft propulsion subsystems and ion engine experiment. 13.4.5.17.3 Television Camera (GSFC) A subminiature television camera is mounted inside the-EVM with the lens attached through a hole in the prime focus feed plate to provide by ground command a view of the 9. 1-meter (30-foot) parabolic reflector after deployment. Its primary purpose is to verify that the reflector is properly deployed and-indicate possible damage or determine any change in the status of the reflector. This information will be used in operating and analyzing the communications system. 13-128 13.4.5.17,4 Interferometer High Data Rate Acquisition System (GSFC) The purpose of this system is to-provide the Spacecraft Attitude Precision Point­ ing and Slewing Adaptive Control (SAPPSAC) experiment with data for long-term eval­ uation of spacecraft vibrations, flexible motions, and thermal distortions as well as for calibrating the spacecraft's interferometer in flight. 13.4.5.18 Operational Results Since these are experimental satellites no operational traffic will be carried. 13-129 dITED REFERENCES 1.
