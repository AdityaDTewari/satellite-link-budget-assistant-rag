Then Georgia reinter­ rogated the satellite and received the message again. The above tests were performed in other variations using voice and one channel of teletype until the fortieth pass, when the Georgia site sent seven simultaneous multiplexed teletype messages in a single transmission to the satellite for storage. The satellite was then interrogated and good teletypewriter copy was received. 2-8 In summary, the communications package was interrogated 78 times, loaded with new material 28 times, and operated as a real time relay for a total of 117 deliberate operations. Until battery-exhaustion on December 30, 1958, the satellite demonstrated conclusively the practical operation of a satellite radio relay system capable of spanning intercontinental distances. 2.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS Since Project SCORE was an experimental program, no operational traffic was passed. Further, the operational reliabilities of the satellite and ground terminals were generally good and in agreement with prelaunch expectations. This performance reflected the exclusive usage of state-of-the-art hardware that characterized this system's implementation. 2-9 RELATED REFERENCES 1. S. P. Brown and G. F.
