Recognizing the need for more efficient systems, INTELSAT began to consider demand access approaches to multiple utilization of the same satellite transponder. In demand access, the general concept is to assign nonoverlapping allocations of satellite power and thne-frequency spectrum to users, in real time, as their demand for service occurs. Both TDMA and FDMA systems providing demand-access service are theoretically feasible. The SPADE system is an FDMA demand-access system given extensive consid­ eration by INTELSAT. SPADE has been designed for links ranging from fractional requirements to 12 and 24 channels and is a PCM-PSK-FDMA system. The develop­ ment of SPADE was begun in 1964. The salient features of the SPADE system include digital PCM encoding of voice on a single channel per carrier, the ability to transmit to the satellite only during talker activity, quadriphase PSK modulation, system self­ assignment of channels, and operation with standard manual or automatic international signaling and switching systems. The ability to deactivate earth terminal transmis­ sions during periods of talker inactivity tends to compensate for having to operate satellite transponders in a backed-off mode such that linear transfer functions are provided. The system is compatible with the INTELSAT II, III, and IV satellites. It was tested between Andover, Maine, and Cayey, Puerto Rico, over INTELSAT II; and later between Etam, West Virginia, and Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, over INTELSAT flI. The SPADE system is now operational and has been assigned to trans­ ponder 10 of the INTELSAT IV in the Atlantic region, and is serving 12 accesses. It is anticipated that by 1976 as many as 40 stations will be using SPADE. Following the MATE system success, INTELSAT started planning for the next generation of TDMA systems, with emphasis on extending the state-of-the-art in all 10-51 technological areas relating to TDMA. The resulting experimental"}
