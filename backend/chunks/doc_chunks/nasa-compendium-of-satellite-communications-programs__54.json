(3) Showed that single-sideband frequency division multiplexing on uplink and phase modulation by the composite received signal on downlink is practical means of multiple access. (4) Demonstrated feasibility of VHF satel­ lite communications among small mobile terminals. (5) Provided data on milli­ -Eeter wave propagation. (6) Gave initial indication of potential L-Band holds for aircraft and maritime communications. (7) Displayed the difficulties that can be encountered in attempting to deploy and initially stabilize gravity gradient stabilized satellites. (8) Parabolic antenna 9.1 m (30 ft) in diameter unfurled in space. (1) Demonstrated operational UHF and SHF mobile earth terminals. (2) Displayed feasibility of channelized satellite repeater capable of switched input/output con­ nections. (3) Provided gyrostat satellite stabilization. (4) Demonstrated opera­ tional frequency hopping modem. (1) Provided first operational all digital satellite system using spread spectrum multiple access. (1) Employed conventional FM-FDMA technology to minimize system risk. (1) Demonstrated combined use of earth coverage and narrow coverage antennas on one spacecraft, and cross-coupling between the antenna channels. (1) Provided telecommunications and TV service to remote areas with unattended earth terminals. (2) Provided the first domestic satellite communiatiofs link for U. S. SECTION 2 -SCORE 2.1 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The objective of Project SCORE (Signal Communication by Orbiting Relay Equipment) was to place in orbit a 24-meter .(80-foot) Atlas missile and to use this as a platform for a communication system capable of spanning intercontinental dis­ tances. The ultimate goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of such a system and to explore some of the technical and operational problems that would attend a military satellite communication system. The communications portion of the project was as­ signed to the U. S. Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, late in July 1958. SCORE was successfully launched by the Air Force"}
