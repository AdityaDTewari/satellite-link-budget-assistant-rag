(25) The VHF transponders on ATS-1 and 3 have, additionally, been employed in various special tests and demonstrations. These include communications support for selected Apollo landings and tests of: aircraft to aircraft communications when the two aircraft are operating near opposite poles of the earth, (26), chirp modulation as a means of overcoming multipath effects and doppler shifts, (27) educational and public radio transmissions in Alaska, and VHF propagation phenomena. The latter include measurements of multipath, scintillation, and Faraday rotation effects. Each satellite's telemetry beacon and the Third Harmonic Generator (i. e. , third harmonic of telemetry beacon) on ATS-3 have also been employed for such measure­ ments. These measurements, in addition to supplying direct propagation information, have been useful in studies to determine the temporal makeup of the earth's ionosphere. 13. 2. 6 Operational Results Since ATS-1 and 3 were experimental satellites, no operational traffic was carried. The operational performance of the NASA ATS ground terminals was good. In general, it was also shown that operational mobile VHF terminals were feasible. However, in specific cases of hastily assembled experimental VHF facilities, operational difficulties including insufficient transmitter power, antenna anomalies, and poor equipment reliability were encountered, The operational performance of the two spin stabilized satellites was basically quite good. Specific minor difficulties encountered on ATS-1 included a gradial decay of radiated power when both SHF transponders and all four TWTs were energized and occasional SSCC picture streaking. The former was determined 13-28 to be a temperature problem and operation with.three TWTs was -found to be sustain­ able. The latteroccurred during periods when the spacecraft load exceeded solar array output to the extent that the batteries were"}
