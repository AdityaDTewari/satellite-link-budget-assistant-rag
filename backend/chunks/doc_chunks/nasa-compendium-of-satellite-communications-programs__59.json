Figure 2-2. SCORE Ground Station Interconnection Diagram The VHF communications receivers and transmitters in the ground station were commercial FM equipment adapted for use in the SCORE Project. For monitoring the satellite's tracking beacons, receiving equipment was provided which enabled reception of the tracking frequency near 108 MHz. In all but the California station, the ground antenna was positioned by an operator maximizing the 108-MHz signal reception with the antenna positioning controls. At the California station, the azimuth control was slaved to the alidade of an experimental direction-finding equipment while the elevation control was manually varied. The communication characteristics of the ground stations are tabulated in Table 2-5. 2.5 EXPERIMENTS On the first orbit, attempts were made by the California ground station to interrogate the comfinunication package designated No. 1.

Since no other orbit that day was close enough to the ground station, no further attempts were made to interrogate the communication equipment. On"}
