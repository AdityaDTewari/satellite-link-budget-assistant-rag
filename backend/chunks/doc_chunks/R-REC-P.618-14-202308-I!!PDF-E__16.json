However, the accuracy of this procedure has not been established. 2.2.1.3.2 Long -term frequency scaling of rain attenuation statistics If reliable attenuation data measured at one frequency are available, the following empirical formula giving an attenuation ratio directly as a function of frequency and attenuation may be applied for"}
