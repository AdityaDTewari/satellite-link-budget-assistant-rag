A few links will be used to provide wideband digital traffic between selected areas in support of wideband data and digitized voice requirements as in Stage la. A typical DSCS Phase II Stage lb link configuration is given in Figure 17-2. The four satellite configuration is a typical link plan pending the next scheduled dual launch during the first half of 1975. A two satel­ lite configuration is currently in operation. AN/TSC-54 terminals will be available for contingency operation as described for Stage la. In Stage lb all of the AN/TSC-54 terminals will have been modified for contingency operation through the satellite NB. They will be provided with PN equip­ ment to achieve an antijam capability. Note that operation with the satellite's narrow coverage antennas, in itself, provides jammer rejection when the beam can be placed so as not to include the jammer. Stage Ic will begin when new development in digital equipment (PCM, TDM, PSK and later, coding equipment) is introduced into the system and the analog system is converted to a digital system. FDMA will still be used to the satellite. The intro­ duction of digital operation will result in increased system capacity through a more efficient combination of different types of traffic (voice, TTY, secure voice, data, and wideband data) than is possible in an analog system, and through the use of coding, which allows more efficient use of satellite power. As the time division multiplex (TDM) and pulse code modulation (PCM) equipment becomes available, the system will phase from an analog system to a hybrid, and finally into a digital system. Pro­ tected traffic will continue to be provided using pseudonoise equipment. However, the CDMA modems employed will be of an advanced model specifically designed to meet the Phase II system requirements. A full complement"}
