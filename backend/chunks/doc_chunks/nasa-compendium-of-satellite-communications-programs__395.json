Support­ ing these major areas are the RF input/output circuitry, wideband data unit, mono­ pulse detector, command distributor, and dc-dc converters. Figure 13-18 shows the signal interfaces. - The receiver includes preamplifiers, monopulse modulators, mixers, filters and the required interconnecting circuits. The IF amplifier consists of an IF input switch matrix,; three identical IF am­ plifiers (f. = 150 MHz, Af = 40 MHz or 12 MHz, on command and an IF output switch matrix). The synthesizer uses a single- frequency (100 MHz) oscillator from which-it synthesizes all the other desired frequencies. It can operate in the coherent mode, wherein the VOC and all the frequencies derived from it are phase-locked to the re­ ceived signal. In the noncoherent mode a temperature compensated crystal oscillator acts as the reference. The transmitter portion of the transponder is comprised of the up-converter, the drivers and the power amplifiers for C-band, S-band, and L-band. Tables 13-34 through 13-38 give the signal interfaces, and the expected perform­ ance of the transponder.
