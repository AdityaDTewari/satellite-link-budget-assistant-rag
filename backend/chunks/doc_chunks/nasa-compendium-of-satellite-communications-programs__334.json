When in this mode (i. e., SSB-FD1VIA/PM-) the spacecraft is a signal processing repeater. Single side band (SSB) signals-from individual terminals are frequency division multiplexed on the uplink. The individual signals are combined in the spacecraft and down-converted to provide a composite baseband that phase modulates the transmitted carrier. The downlink signal is detected by a discriminator in the ground terminal receiver and demultiplexed to derive the desired individual message. In this system, uplink noise becomes a more significant factor in determining total performance but requirements for frequency spectrum and uplink power control are reduced. The use of SSB modu­ lation on the uplink tended to restrict the traffic handled to conventional 4-kHz voice. Table 13-7.

Signal processing employed for operation in this mode is depicted in Table 13-8. Both television and multichannel voice traffic were commonly handled with the spacecraft configured in this manner, 13-9"}
