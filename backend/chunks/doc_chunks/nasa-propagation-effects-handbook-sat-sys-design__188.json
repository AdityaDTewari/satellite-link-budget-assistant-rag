Special purpose systems,unusual variants, orunusualsystemarchitectures will require modifications totheprocedure. Forexample, those systemswhich employ adaptive power control oradaptive antenna beam control fall into the \"unusual\" category. Theprocedureisbased ontime percentage availability oroutage as theprimaryandinitial designcriterion. Emphasis onthis approach is necessitatedbythefact that thelargest amount ofreliable propagation data ispresentedintimepercentage terms. Where othercriteria areimportant, differentprocedures maybenecessary. Buteven where othercriteria are employed, itisexpedient toperform initial gross sizingcalculations according totimepercentage criteria. Aspreviouslynoted,thesystemdesignprocessisnotatrue synthesis. Itconsists rather ofiterative analyses. Thedesignerbegins with somerough \"guesstimates\" ofparameters such asearth terminal antenna size, satelliteRFpower, along with asetofsystemrequirements (coverage area orlocations, capacity, connectivity, andservice criteria). By employing analytic (notsynthetic)procedures, thedesigner determines whether theinitial parameters andtherequirements/criteria areconsistent. Ifnot, additional iterations aremade, with adjustments either totheparameters or totherequirements. This lastpoint isnottrivial: ifthere isalarge disparitybetween calculated systemperformance andtherequirements, itmay benecessary toconsult with thesource oftherequirements andagree toa change (e.g., lower capacity oravailability). Thefinal system design parameters shouldalways beverified inasmany variables aspossible according toavailable data. Thus, although theinitial design mayhave been performed usinganavailability criterion, itmaybeofinterest and importance topredict outage duration statistics,ifthenecessary data are available. 363 7.3.2 Path Performance Versus OverallChannel Performance: Availability ,Allocation Thetypical satellite comunication application involves twoorfour distinct links. Forexample, atelephone trunk systembetween LosAngeles (LA) andNewYork (NY)will involve these links: LAtoSatellite Satellite toNY NYtoSatellite Satellite toLA Iftheperformance requirements forthis example specifytheavailability ofa duplex telephone circuit between NYandLA,thesystemdesignermaybefaced with adifficultproblem. Ingeneral, finding thesimplex, duplex,or(worst ofall) system-wideavailability with multiple earth terminal locations isa problemofconsiderablestatisticalcomplexity. Significantly, this problem isunique tosatellite systems, andisparticularly aggravated atthehigher frequencies. Terrestrial line-of-sight andscatter microwave communications systems represent asimplerproblem, sincethey donotspan large distances in asingle hop. Also, symmetryapplies inthese systems. Statistical assumptions made andprocedures developed forterrestrial systems,andfor satellite systems below 10GHz, maynotbeadequate fortheapplications to which this Handbook isdirected.
