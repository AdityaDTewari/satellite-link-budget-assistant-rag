Both systems-were demonstrated to be feasible. The TDMA development extended and confirmed earlier TDMA demonstrations con­ ducted as part of the ATS program. Between late 1968 and early 1971; two new operational systems came into being. A Skynet satellite was placed into a g6ostationary orbit providingvisibility from Europe and much of Africa, in late 1969, and an operational military ssrstem for the United Kingdom was established. The satellite was based on technology developed in the IDCSP program but pseudonoise PSK was used to.provide multiple access in the first all-digital operational system. NATO satellites Were.launched-into geostationary orbits in early 1970 and early 1971. They were positioned over the Atlantic to provide operational service for-the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cpuntries and employed conventional technology developed in the IDCSP and Skynet programs. 1-21 On the LES program, testing of the UHF satellite launched in late 1968 con­ tinued. In addition to displaying the switched antenna, this satellite demonstrated the feasibility of high-efficiency, solid-state UHF transmitters operating directly from the unregulated primary power source, autonomous satellite stationkeeping and station­ changing, and reliable pulsed plasma microthrusters, The demonstrated autonomous stationkeeping capability, together with the previously displayed autonomous attitude control system, provided the potential for significantly reducing future ground tracking and command requirements. The spacecraft microthrusters were of interest as a means towards attaining highly precise attitude control and stationkeeping systems. Microthrusters were first considered in the ATS program as a means of providing stationkeeping and stationchanging on gravity gradient stabilized satellites where the attitude correction torques were quite low. In early 1969, a Tacsat spacecraft was placed into a geostationary orbit and used along wlih the latest LES satellite to further demonstrate and develop a tactical military satellite communications capability. Tacsat included both UHF and SHF transponders, an input/output switching capability. and"}
