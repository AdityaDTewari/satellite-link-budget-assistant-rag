(5) Separate transmitting and receiving antennas, each operating at different frequencies, were employed at both Goldstone and Holmdel to provide full duplex operations.

The Goldstone terminal employed a third frequency and its separate transmit and receive antennas to provide a radar tracking capability. (13) Ordinarily, both Holmdel and Stump Neck received'from Goldstone during the first part of a satellite pass. After the balloon set for Goldstone, Stump Neck then transmitted to Holmdel. On a few passes, both Goldstone and Stump Necksimultaneeusly transmitted to Holmdel, using circular polarizations of opposite sense and slightly different transmit frequencies. Echo I provided periods of mutual visibility up"}
