The eight stations which support the network ser­ vice are shown in Figure 18-23 and the twenty-five stations used for the remote service are shown in Figure 18-24. All eight of the stations supporting network service are currently capable of re­ ceiving three, television channels simultaneously, and although the Allan Park, Riviere Rouge and Lake Cowichan Stations are used to transmit- programs on a full-time basis, all are equipped with a: transmit capability for occasional use. To provide the CBC with the desired flexibility in program origination and recep­ tion for the entire television service, a Cue and Control System embodying remote switching of transmit and receive chains was designed and implemented by Telesat. The system took into consideration the CBC's programming constraints and the fact that the majority of earth stations in support of their services Were equipped as receive stations only and as such, lacked the ability to give status feedback to control centers. It permits the complete control of program distribution by either manual or automatic means from either of the two identical control centers at the CBC premises in Toronto and Montreal.' The circuit carrying the cue and control- commands, which are speci­ fically addressed for each station in the network, is multiplexed into the audio portion of.the television baseband and transmitted along with the video and audio signals. Ad­ tditionally, since both~of the control centers have equal access to the network and since each is automatically updated on commands regardless of the point of origin,"}
