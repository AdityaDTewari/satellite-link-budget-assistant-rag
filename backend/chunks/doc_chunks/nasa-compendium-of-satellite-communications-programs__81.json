DP.PooPA'9Z3-18 In addition to the experiments listed in the table, several tests of perhaps some­ what lesser importance were conducted employing primarily Echo 1. Voice trans­ mission evaluations were extended by utilizing single-sideband, narrow-band phase, and amplitude-modulation techniques for comparison with frequency modulation. (5) The performance did,not equal that with FM, indicating that the coherent bandwidth of the channel had not been exceeded in the tests; therefore, conventional theories for comparing modulation techniques applied. Measured doppler shift was compared with theory and found to be in good agreement. Performance of FM with feedback receivers was evaluated and found to agree well with previous laboratory measurements and theory. Performance of the ground terminal tracking systems was closely watched. All performed well, and the potential of automatic tracking was demonstrated. In addition, a television signal was transmitted and limited quality reception obtained, using facilities developed for Project West Ford. (31) Numerous notable demonstrations were also conducted. (5)(30) Most of these occurred during the early days of Echo I and tended to dramatize the potential of this type of communications. Included were a tape-recorded voice message by President Eisenhower during the first satellite pass on August 12, 1960; prerecorded 2-way messages by President Eisenhower and Senator L. B. Johnson on August 13, 1960; and the first 2-way live voice transfer between Mr. W. C. Jakes of Bell Telephone Laboratories and Mr. P. Tardani of Jet Propulsion Labs also on August 13, 1960. Finally, Echo I provided a first in international communications, when Russia agreed to participate in a cooperative experiment with NASA and to supply NASA with tracking data during"}
