Since no other orbit that day was close enough to the ground station, no further attempts were made to interrogate the communication equipment. On the following day, package No. 2 was interrogated by a temporary site established at Cape Canaveral (now Cape Kennedy) for prelaunch checkout. It responded and the ground crew received the following prerecorded message from President Eisenhower: This is the President of the United States speaking. Through the marvel of scientific advance, my voice is coming to you from a satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one. Through this unique means, I convey to you and to allmankind America's wish for peace on earth and good will towards men everywhere. On each of the subsequent days, each function for which the equipment was designed was tested and successfully demonstrated. Among the experiments per­ formed were the following: 1. Initially, transmission of President Eisenhower's prerecorded voice message followed by one channel of teletype code. 2. Direct relay of California's communication site identification in voice, followed by the President's message in teletype code. The Texas site received these signals with two short fades and the Arizona and Georgia sites received portions of the transmission. 3. While clearing the tape recorder, California transmitted in voice to the satellite for storage. Texas interrogated the satellite, and both Texas and Georgia received the voice loud and clear. Then Georgia reinter­ rogated the satellite and received the message again. The above tests were performed in other variations using voice and one channel of teletype until the fortieth pass, when the Georgia site sent seven simultaneous multiplexed teletype messages in a single transmission to"}
