The carrier-to-noise power ratio is found by setting N=kTSB: C N=EIRP\u0012\u0015 4\u0019r\u00132Gr lkTSB It is common to represent the CNR over 1 Hz of signal bandwidth ( B= 1 Hz), so that the resulting expression can simply divided by the bandwidth to get the ratio: C N0=EIRP\u0012\u0015 4\u0019r\u001321 lkGr TS In dB, this expression becomes \u0014C N0\u0015 dB=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr TS\u0015 dB+ 228:6 ( units: dB-Hz ) where 10 log(1=k) = 228:6dBW/K-Hz. Note that receive antenna's gain and the receiver tem- perature are grouped together as a ratio that is often called the receiver gure of merit . This Prof. Sean Victor Hum Radio and Microwave Wireless Systems Link Budgets Page 2 per-Hz form of the CNR is useful since the CNR can be found for any signal bandwidth by simply subtracting 10 logB: \u0014C N\u0015 dB=EIRP \u0000FSL\u0000L+\u0014Gr TS\u0015 dB+ 228:6\u000010 log(B) ( units: dB ) Hence, a link budget is obtained by \\accounting\" for each of these terms in a budget in dB units, where losses are \\negative\" and gains are \\positive\". Usually, Lmust be expanded into a larger summation of terms to account for each of the loss e ects that we have studied in detail in this course. Link Margin As discussed in class, some additional margin is usually provided for in the implementation of the system so that it can deal with worst-case fading caused by the atmosphere and other e ects. The margin is usually introduced by increasing a combination of the transmit power, transmit antenna gain, and receive antenna gain. Often, it is the margin that is of most interest in the budget, since it tells you how much room is built into the link budget. If the minimum required CNRCNR reqis known, the margin is simply the di erence in dB between"}
