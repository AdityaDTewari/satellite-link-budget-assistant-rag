However, for negative apparent elevation angles from an elevated earth station, the height decreases along the propagation path between the earth station and the minimum grazin g height and then increases along the propagation path between the minimum grazing height and space. This is shown in Fig. 3 for an earth station at height ℎ1 with an apparent elevation angle of 90o−β1. From Snell’s law in polar coordinates: 𝑛(ℎ𝐺)(𝑅𝐸+ℎ𝐺)=𝑛(ℎ1) (𝑅𝐸+ℎ1)sinβ1 (20) in which case the grazing height, ℎ𝐺, can be determined by iteratively solving equation (20). The refractive index, 𝑛(ℎ), can be determined from equations (1) and (2) of Recommendation ITU-R P.453 for the specific atmospheric profile of interest, typically one of the reference profiles in Recommendation ITU -R P.835 . The net gaseous attenuation is the sum of the gaseous attenuations for Path 1 and Path 2. Path 1 is the gaseous attenuation between a virtual earth station at height ℎ𝐺 km and the actual earth station at a height of ℎ1 km at an apparent elevation angle of 0 degrees , and Path 2 is the gaseous attenuation between a virtual earth station at height ℎ𝐺 km and the maximum atmospheric height (typically 100 km) at an apparent elevation angle of 0 degrees . 14 Rec.
