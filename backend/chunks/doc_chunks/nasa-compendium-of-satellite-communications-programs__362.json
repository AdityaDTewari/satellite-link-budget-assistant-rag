Aircraft transmissions arrive at the satellite at L-Band where they are combined and transferred to C-Band for transmission to the ground stations. An L-Band ground station transmit capability. is also provided to allow full testing of the satellite from the ground. The earth coverage supplied by ATS-5 for the millimeter wave and L-band tests is shown in Figure 13-9. SHF, C-Band, operating frequencies on the gravity gradient stabilized space­ craft were the same as on ATS'I & 3 (see Table 13-4). The same is true of the TT&C frequencies (see Table 13-6). The millimeter wave and L-Band operating frequehcies are. shown in Table 13-21. (31, 32) The indi­ cated millimeter wave frequencies are of interest in that they are located at the first two windows in the frequency spectrum above 10 GHz where water vapor and oxygen absorption are low. Millimeter wave propagation, in general, is of interest in that it offers a possible means of reducing overcrowding in the lower bands. Additionally, it offers extremely wideband capabilities, high gain-small aperture antenna 13-35 r ATS-V SPACECRAFT STATUS - MODULATOR 15 3 GHz TRANSMITTER TELEMETRY SUBSYSTEMS COMMAND SUBSYStEMS NASA MMW STATION ROSMAN.
