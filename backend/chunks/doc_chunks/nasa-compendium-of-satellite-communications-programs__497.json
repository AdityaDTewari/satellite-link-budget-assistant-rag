The tests were conducted 'successfully with positive results. 2. Phase H implementation commenced in.March 1970 to provide an opera­ tional system during 1971-1974. Two satellites were launched success­ fully into synchronous orbit, with one satellite acting as a backup to provide an expected 5-year systerh capability. Table 16-1 summarizes launch.and status information on the NATO SATCOM Phase II satellites. The satel­ lites were procured and launched by the USAF, with technical support from the Aerospace Corporation, under terms of an agreement reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1967 by the U.S. and NATO. Satellite telemetry, tracking and command services are also provided by the USAF Space Ground Link System (SGLS). The satellite technology developed for U. K. SKYNET I satellites was used in NATO SATCOM Phase II satellites. Two minor changes were made to provide a more effective system for NATO. The first modification changed the equal power division between the 20-MHz and 2-MHz channels to a 6:1 ratio, respectively. The second modification shifted the antenna aim­ ing point from the equatorial subsatellite point to a point on earth between 400 and 45 N latitude since all NATO earth terminals were to be located, north of the equator. This yielded a more effective power, 6pread.for NATO coverage over the Northern Hemisphere. 16-1 Table 16-1.
