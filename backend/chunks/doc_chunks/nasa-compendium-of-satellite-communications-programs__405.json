ATS-6 Mobile Terminal System Block Diagram 13.4.4.6 Low Cost Earth Terminals ( 4 2 ) The ATS-6 earth stations are designed to meet the needs of both the health and education communities. After the HEW ATS-F User Policy Committee established the types and characteristics of terminals to be developed, the detailed specifications were written jointly by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Conmmica­ tions, NASA, and the Federation of Rocky Mountain States.
