Precise spacecraft location is obtained by a trilateration technique in which accuratemeasurements of the distance from three ground stations to each spacecraft are used. ATS-F trilateration technique in which accurate measurements of the dis­ tance from three ground stations to each spacecraft are used. ATS-6 trilateration measurements will be made from the three NASA tracking stations at Rosman, N. C., Mojave, California; and Santiago, Chile. ATS-5 trilateration stations will be located in Schenectady, N. Y.; Hawaii, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The ATS ground station at the Rosman, N. C., site will serve as the primary L-Band experiment support facility for.communicating with the ATS-6 and the ATS-5 spacecraft. A terminal at the Nationar Maritime Research Center, Kings Point, N. Y., also will serve to communicate with ATS-6. Other ground facilities planned for monitoring ATS-6 L-Band transmissions in­ clude the FAA's National Aviation Flight Experiments Center at Atlantic City, N. J.; the Transportation Systems Center's facility at Westford, Mass.; and the Canadian Communications Research Centre's facility in Ottawa, Canada. Four jet aircraft and five ships will be provided for this experiment by the United States, *ESRO, and Canada. All these units will be equipped with special L-Band com­ munications and ranging equipment. An ESRO-provided ship also will be equipped to test an L-Band emergency buoy designed to provide search and rescue teams with a distressed ship's final position, information vital to ,locating survivors.
