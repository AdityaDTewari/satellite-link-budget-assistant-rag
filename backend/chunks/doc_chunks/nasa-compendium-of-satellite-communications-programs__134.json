The command receiver spurious responses resulted in a recommendation that more complex command signals be designed for all future spacecraft. 7.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Relay system consisted of the orbiting satellite, the complex of partici­ pating ground and test stations, the Operations Center, and GSFC supporting activ­ ities. The satellite itself was basically a microwave repeater which received frequency modulated communication signals on 1725 MHz for translation to 4170 MHz 7-2 Table 7-2.

In the translating process the modulation index was tripled to compensate for the bandwidth limitations of the earth terminal klystron transmitters. The repeater transmitted one-way television signals, when operated in the wideband mode, and 12 simultaneous two-way telephone conversations when operated in the narrow-band mode. In addition to a redundant wideband communication system, the spacecraft had a radiation experiment package, electrical power system, command and telemetry systeni, and supporting structure. Satellite operating frequencies are given in Table 7-3. The characteristics of the spacecraft and the ground stations are described in Sections 7. 3"}
