The second daily orbit cuts diagonally across the Western Hemisphere on its ascending pass, and has been used on alimited basis to provide a Moscow-Cuba link. This secondary low utilization orbit (Figure 11-1) provides maximum mutual visibility of Washington and Moscow. In Figure 11-2, the mutual visibility of the Washington- Moscow link is plotted as a function of the ascending node of the orbit: The shaded bar areas indicate the two daily longitudes of the ascending node of the existing Molniya-1 satellites. Figure 11-3 illustrates the duration of mutual visibility of the Moscow-Washington link for a single 12-hour orbit as a function of the longitude of the ascending node.
