Additionally, numerous special tests were performed by NASA ground terminal engineers and the Japanese and Australian governments. The Japanese tests employed the Kashima ground terminal and repeated many of the SSB-FDMA/PM 13-23 Table 13-15. TV System Design Characteristics Parameter Value 1. RF Carrier Deviations a, By video signal + 10 MHz peak b, By audio subarrier + 1 IVHz peak for 6 MHz subarrier, + 0. 715 MHz peak for 4.5 MHz subcarrier, or-+ 1, 3 MHz psak for 7.5 MHz suboarrier. 2. Audio Sbcarrier Frequencies 6. 0 MHz (4. 5 or 7. 5 MHz optional) 3. Subcarrier Deviation by Audio + 200 KHz peak 4. Video Section Bandwidth 30 Hz to 4. 5 MHz (3.5 MHz optional) 5. Audio Section Bandwidth 30 Hz to 13 KHz Table 13-16. Frequency Translation TV System !Experiments Type ExperimeTi Natu.re of Results Obtained 1, Continuou Random Noise 51 dB peak-to-peak signal to weighted rms noise measured at Rosman with peak power on ATS-3. CCIR standards require 56 dB for 99% of time. 2. Periodic Noise (Power S/N of 43 dB with all significant components below supply hum) 1 KH7 obtained to exceed CCIR recommendations by 8 dB. 3. Crosstalk An initial audio-to-video problem caused by coupling ih a common baseband equipment power supply was eliminated to reduce crosstalk level to 75 dB down or more, 4, Linear Waveform Distortion Frequency response, short time wave form distortion line-time and field-time waveform distortion, and envelope delay evaluated. CCIR recommendations for international TV circuit met and those for system M (Canada and USA) partially met. 5, Non-Linear Wavpform Differential gain and color vector error (equivalent of Distortion differential phase) evaluated.
