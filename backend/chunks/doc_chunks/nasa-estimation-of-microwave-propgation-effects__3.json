INTRODUCTION Assatelliteandearthrelay communication services continueto expand involume ofusage, increased information bandwidth requirements, andnew applications, aconsistent demand will betoward theuse of higher frequencies where permissible. The inuninent use ofmillimeter wavebands [above 50GHz) has prompted theoretical and experimental studies ofthelimitations imposed bytheatmosphere online-of-sight relay and earth-to-space [both up- anddown-link) propagation paths. The studies have shown thatlimitations arise mainly from signal attenuation (absorption andscattering bythemedium), noise emission (natural), or interference (man-made) produced inpart orwholly bypropagation pheno- mena. Oneoftheprinciple causesofboth attenuation, noise andpoten- tial interference isthatcausedbyrain orhydrometeors. Although the physics ofscatteringbyhydrometeors iswell inhand [Crane, 1971), several different methodologies have developed toattempt totreat this particular phenomenon, having atotallystatistical occurrence behavior asopposed togaseous absorption and emission bytheatmosphere which is continuously present with only astatistical variation about themean. Attenuation causedbyrain aswell asthegaseous contribution increases significantly tomany tensofdecibels atthehigher frequencies deeper into themillimeter wavebands.

The basic model (with fewer refinements) has previouslybeen submitted for inclusion bytheCCIR (CCIR, 1978a) asahandbook tool forgeneral application. With asize- ableamountofmeasurement data fromsatellite links operatingatfre- quencies upto30GHznow becoming available,themodel canbeeasily evaluated beyond thataccomplished atpresent. Themodel isalsoamenable tofurtherrefinements andupdates asthesedata comparisons aremade andadditional higher frequency databecome available. Cases ofmodel usage andco,_arisons will beofextreme value, iffedback, toprovide thebasis ofinformation onwhich these further refinements may bemade. Thefrequency range treated inthis report isfrom 1to300GHz (30cmto1amwavelengths)."}
