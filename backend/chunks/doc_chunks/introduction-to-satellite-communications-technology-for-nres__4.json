Older satellites are often let to drift north and south while keeping in their east-west slots. Satellites allowed to dnfi are said to be inclined orbits. This might require some tracking by ground equipment, but when the drift is large enough, it allows the satellites to be seen in the polar regions. 3. SPECTRUM Satellites use the microwave band for communications (some older ones used the radio ffequencies UHF, VHF). For a description of the electromagnetic spectrum check h ttp://imagine.gsfc. nasa.gov/docs/scienceAnow - I I/emspectrum. htm 1. I ~ ~~~~~~ ~~~ We modify sound waves to make speech. Dynamics such as loudness and tone are changed to convey meaning. Telecommunication modifies electromechanical signals such as microwaves to carry information in the same ways. Microwave bandwidth is regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and by the ITU internationally. Obtaining parts of the regulated bandwidth is expensive. Satellite operators must apply Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN years in advance to get spectrum for launch support, tracking, telemetery and operations, and for data transfer. Parts of the microwave spectrum are designated and used as follows (for a detailed description see: http://www.NTIA.doc.gov/osmhome/nebbie.html): VHFA-JHF 0.1-0.3 GHz - Milsat- amateur radio, “little” LEO L Band - 1-2 GHz - Mobile Sat/manne, “big” LEO S Band 2-4 GHz - Satellite commandcontrol C Band 4-8 GHz - Data, voice, video distribution Ku 12-18 GHz - Direct TV, Data, Voice, SNG, IP services K 18-27 GHz -N/A (22.3-HzO absorption) Ka 27-40 GHz - The next wave * V 40-75 GHz - Released in the future (60 GHz -02 absorption) Z& v n--A o 1 OTT- n s:i:~-- PACI A YOllU O-IL UIiL - lvLlllLilly-cwa Uplink (from the Earth to the satellite) uses the upper part of a kequency range while downlink uses the lower fi-equencies."}
