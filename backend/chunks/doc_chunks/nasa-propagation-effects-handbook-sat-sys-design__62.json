Ithasbeen shown(Watson andArbabi-1973) that XPIandXPDarethe same ifthehydrometeors responsible forthedepolarization have certain symmetry properties. Thegeometric models that have been used forraindrops andicecrystals have thenecessary symmetry, soXPI=XPDintheory. In practice, ithasbeen found that there isnotasignificantdifference between XPIandXPD. Another term used todescribe depolarization, cross polarization ratio (CPR), isthereciprocal ofXPD. Other parameters inuse, e.g., crosstalk discrimination, crosspolarization distortion, depolarization ratio, crosspolarization level, usually reduce toXPDorXPI. Inthediscussion that follows, itisoften important todistinguish between polarization properties ofawave inspace, andtheparameters thatwe actually measure attheoutput ofthereceiver.

When this performance isclose toideal, and/or theXPDofthewave islow(i.e. severe depolarization), then I=XPD. This will bediscussed in.more detail later. 4.1.2 Hydrometeor Sources ofDepolarization Themajor sourcesofdepolarization onEarth-space paths are hydrometeors, ionospheric Faraday rotation, andmultipath. Thepredominant source atmillimeter wave frequencies ishydrometeors, andrain isthe hydrometeor species that hasthegreatest effect. 106 i 4.l.2.1 Rain. Todetermine theattenuation duetorain, theraindrops are modelled asspheres ofwater suspended inspace. Real raindrops arefalling attheir terminal velocity and, duetothecomplex aerodynamic and hydrostatic forces acting onthem, they areingeneral notspherical. The very small drops (_0.03 cmindiameter) areverynearly spherical, drops in therange ofabout 0.03 to0.10 cmindiameter canbeconsidered oblate spheroids, anddrops with diameters larger than about 0.10 cmareasymmetric blobs with flat orconcave bottoms (Pruppacher andPitter-1971). Depolarization occurs because ofthis lackofspherical symmetry, along with thetendency forthedrops tohave apreferred orientation (i.e., topand bottom flattened). Theeffects"}
