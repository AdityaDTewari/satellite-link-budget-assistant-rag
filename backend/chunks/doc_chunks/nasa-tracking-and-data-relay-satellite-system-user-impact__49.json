In particular, four types which were examined include slotted planar arrays, arrays of helices, paraboloidal reflectors and feeds, and rectangular horns. Table 4.10 pro- vides a summary of the principal characteristics of each of these antennas.(26) The relationships between the dimensions of the antennas and their gains are shown in Figure 4.41 for an operating frequency of 2.25 GHz. In order to proceed to an estimation of the relationship between antenna weight and gain, assumptions were made as to the materials best suited for their fabtication. For example, for an array of helices, lightweight, high-strength materials such as berylli:nm and magnesium, and dielectric materials such as fiberglass and teflon are used. The weights of very large arrays are only rough estimates and specific designs for these antenns in a space environment have not been made. 4-67 2500 1270 HORN LENGTH w 500 i PLANAR z ARRAY O 250 SIDE 127 O PARABOLIC REFLECTOR DIAMETER 50 HELICAL ARRAY LENGTH AND DIAGONAL 25 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 ANTENNA GAIN, DECIBELS 'Figure 4441.
