The satellite frequency plan is contained in Table 12-4. The assignment of the channel (frequency) is a functional responsibility of the SCCF. 12.3 SPACECRAFT As discussed in Section.12. 1, the DSCS Phase I space subsystem consisted of 26 satellites. In addition, an unsuccessful launch with eight satellites occurred on August 26, 1966; \"however, the plastic shroud encasing the satellites in the nose of 12-6 26 I' -- ___ 4* g# 24 22ZV 0 V_ _ _ _ __ _ 18 , 16 AVAILABILITY OF AT LEAST 1 TWCSATELLITES \\V LIDJ z 0 w z 14 12 10 -VILAVAILABILITYTOF iONE SATELLITE I? -% 1 -­ 'I ____________ 0 10 203D040 50 60 70 75 80 85 90 92 VISIBILITY-% 94 9i5 96 97 98 99 Figure 12-2.

Each satellite weighs approximately 45.4 kg (100 ibs) and is solar powered. No batteries are provided. The transponder of the DSCS Phase I satellite is a double frequency conver­ sion, hard-limiting repeater operating in the 7-to 8-GHz range. The EIRP has a design minimum of 7 dBW. Each satellite had a beacon signature at its uiique telemetry frequency, in the 400-MHz area, for identification purposes. The repeater, shown in simplified block diagram form in Figure 12-5, is pri­ marily"}
