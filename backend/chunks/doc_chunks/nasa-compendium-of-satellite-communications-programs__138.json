In any planes parallel to the spin axis the wave was linearly polarized. All spacecraft power was generated by solar cells. Storage batteries charged by the solar cells were used to supply the peak power necessary for repeater opera­ tion. On Relay I the solar cells were boron-doped silicon cells, p-on-n, gridded and covered with 60-mil thick fused sheets. To decrease solar cell degradation due to radiation, n-on-p cells were used on the solar array of Relay II. In addition to the communications repeaters, and other subsystems needed to support the principal mission of Relay, the spacecraft carried a group of components to obtain data on particle radiation in space. These consisted of six radiation detec­ tors and a collection of isolated solar cells and semiconductor diodes. The latter were accumulated on a \"radiation-damage-effects\" panel. 7.4 EARTH STATIONS Some of the major earth stations participating in Project Relay are described in Table 7-5 in terms of their basic characteristics. In the Relay system, the stations at Nutley and Mojave were designated as Test Stations and, as such, had prime responsibility to command the satellite and monitor telemetry. Other stations par­ ticipating in the program under agreements with NASA were designated as Ground 7-7 Table 7-5.
