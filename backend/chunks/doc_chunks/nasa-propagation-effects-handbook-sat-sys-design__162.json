Thespectraofrain andice-induced crosspolarized signalshave been analyzed {Hayworth, etal-lg77) anditappears that acancellation systemwith aI0Hzbandwidth would track themajority ofdepolarizing events. However this bandwidth isprobably insufficient during thesuddenrealignment ofice crystals inthunderstorms andinnonelectrically active precipitation. A suggestion hasbeen madetoconsider useofadual time constantsystem to accommodate alllikely events. Foricecrystal depolarization thecrosspolarphase shiftisusually gOdegrees ofthecopolarized signalandsodifferential attenuation dominates theXPDvariations. Thiseffectwasdisplayed inFigure6.7-6. However depending onthefrequency, rain-induced XPDvariations predominantly shift thephase near 20GHzandbelow andinduce differential attenuation from 20to60GHz{Hogg andChu-1975). 6.7.4 OtherSources ofDepolarization 6.7.4.1Snow Depolarization. Snowdepolarization occursduring both the winter andsummermonths. During thesummermonths snow existsabove the O°Cisotherm. During winter, astheisotherm lowers, thethickness ofthe snow layer increases andthedepolarization duetorain decreases. s InCanada {Hendry, etai-1976)tests usingcircularlypolarlzed diversity radars atfrequencies near 2.9GHz{I0.4 cmwavelength) and16.7GHz {1.8cmwavelength) atanelevationangleof3.2degrees have diagnosed storms during both summerandwinter. During June snowoccurred during astormfrom 2.6to8.2kmaltitude andyielded adifferential phase shiftof0.36 deg/km at2.9GHz. Winter data taken at16.7GHzgave more variable results of0.16 to1.17 deg/km formoderate toheavy snowstorms ranging inaltitude from 70m to2.6km. Themean value ofdifferential phase shiftwas0.69 deg/km at16.7 GHz. 321 a z <._l 0 ZlU8P'13A:ll:l(]V:lYVlOdO0 0 05,-I 3228P'NOIJ.YNII_III:IOSI(] UY'lOdS$Ol:lOI 6.7.4.2Multipath Depo|arization. Thecross-polarized pattern ofaparabolic reflector antenna normally hasitspeak atsmall angles off-axis. This allows oblique indirect rays, which maybepresent onearth-space paths atlow elevation angles,toproduceasignificantcross-polarized component. Measurements have beenmade onterrestrial links at11GHz (Watson, et al-lg73) and22GHz(Turner-1973). Themagnitude oftheindirect signal reflected from theearth canberoughly estimated from thedata inLord and Oliver (1946) taken near3GHz. 6.7.4.3 Refractive Effects. Variations intheradio refractivity (dielectric constant oftropospheric layers) cancause rotation ofthepolarization plane oftherays refracting through thelayers. This condition will occur for layers which arenotperpendicular tothevertical plane containing the transmitter andreceiver asdescribed byLeFrancois, etal(1973). 6.7.5Prediction ofDepolarization Statistics Inmost casesdepolarization arisesduetotwosources: rain and ice. Thestatistics ofdepolarization events canbeestimated using the methodology shown inFigure 6.7-9.
