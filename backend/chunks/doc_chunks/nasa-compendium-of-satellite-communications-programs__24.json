S. Air Force, to provide amateur radio communi­ cations satellites for use by \"Ham radio\" operators throughout the world. Some of these satellites were very short-lived and they, by intent, did not push the state-of­ the-art in satellite communications. 1-3 BIG59 60 61 62 163 64 5 166 67 6(16 9 70 71 72 73 74 SCOfEl COURIER 1i0 WEST FORD .. ........ ...- TELSTAR(2) RELAY( 31 SYNCOM 4 .nirt ,j -IM ir MONS w\"A5A11a0 e Kd JA S LINCOLN EXPERIMENTAL SATELLITE(S) a.'. * r r \"W, INTELSAT(6) MOLNIYA (71 -- IDCSP (DSCS PHASE I) APPLICATIONS TECHNOLOGY SATELLITE (8) ---.
