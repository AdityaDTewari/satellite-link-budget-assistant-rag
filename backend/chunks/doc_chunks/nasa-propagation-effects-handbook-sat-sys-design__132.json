Definition ofDiversity Gain andDiversity Advantage 259 Inthepreceding discussion, ithasbeen implicitly assumed that the fade distributions associated with each individual earth terminal were identical. However, inactual practice this isseldom thecase. These distributions maydiffer because themeasurement period isnotlong enough for thespatial rainfall distribution tobecome uniform; inthis case the differences between thedistributions areanindication oftheuncertainty of themeasurement. Alternatively, local climatological variations maygive rise toreal differences between distributions measured onlyafewkilometers apart; very little isknown definitively about this latter effect. In general, however, since there islittle ornobasis togive greater weight to onedistribution over another, thedefiQitions given ineqs. 6.5-1 and6.5-2 should begeneralized forexperimental data analysis to: GD(A)=Aave(T) -Adiv(T )(6.5-3) Tave(A) I(A) =Tdiv(A )(6.5-4) where Aave(T) istheaverage ofthesingle terminal fade depth exceeded for thepercentage time, T,andTave(A) istheaverage ofsingle terminal percentages oftime exceeded atthefade level A. Allnutt(1978)hasattempted toutilizeboth thediversitygain and diversity advantage forcomparing sets ofdiversitydata. Using thesame data sets Allnutt shows that thediversitygain presentation allowed trends and similarities tobeobserved, whereas plotting thediversityadvantage from the same data gave highly scattered results.
