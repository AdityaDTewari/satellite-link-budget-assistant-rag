This is because a satellite is less capable of dealing with the overtones derived from transmission. The higher the fi-equency the more bandwidth it takes to send a bit. That is because there that are absorbed by water and free Oxygen. Also, the higher the frequency the smaller is the antenna needed for the same bandwidth, as antenna size is related to the size of the waveforms. The exception to this is L-Band where the signal is omni-directional. K- Band is not used for satellite transmission as these frequencies are absorbed completely by water vapor. Traditional C-Band, the first spectrum opened to satellites for communications, requires a BUD (big ugly dish) at least 3 meters in diameter for even a small bandwidth V-Sat, and up to 20 meters for a proper Earth station. Ku and Ka use small dishes that can be portable. 4. EARTH STATIONS Teleports, gateways, and “flyaways” are names for the terrestrial interface where the signal from satellites meets the ground and where data is uplinked to the satellite. The traditional architecture for satellite systems is to have a central complex with an antenna or antennas controlling transmission to and &om satellites. Smaller antennas communicate to other ground stations or terrestrial networks via. the central teleport. Teleports act as a gateway between terrestrial networks such as the PSTN, the Internet or cable TV infrastructure, 2nd the srtellite. is gicztei atterriattioii of the sipa! “vj: the amospheie ii~ i;v‘e get c!osei to &e frequei~ci~~ 4 Introduction to Satellite"}
