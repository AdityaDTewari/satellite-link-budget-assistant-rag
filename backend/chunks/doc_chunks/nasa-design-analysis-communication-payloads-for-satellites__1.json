Introduction Space communications system design can be tedious and complicated when using unoptimized design tools. This is certainly the case with previous link budget calculator tools, which rely on complicatedand contrived spreadsheet operations. In such operations, information is easily lost and/or miscalculatedbecause of the lack of scalability of the spreadsheet formulas. This, in turn, makes communication payload ∗This work was completed over a summer internship at NASA GRC, SCaN, 21000 Brookpark Rd., Student AIAA member. †Senior Physicist, Aerospace Communications Systems Branch, 21000 Brookpark Rd. 1o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics design hard to learn for a newcomer to the ﬁeld. After a link budget is determined for a NASA mission, physical communication payload components must be picked to create and close this link. This step ofthe process involves looking up each company’s product and comparing the product’s characteristics withthe requirements, which takes a lot of time. Creating a more intuitive user interface for calculating thelink budget and picking payload components can reduce any possible error with calculations, obtaining component information, and increase eﬃciency for experienced communications engineers. I.A. Background In the past, other link budget tools have been created to aid the user in calculating a link budget. They have evolved from CLI programs, to formulae across spreadsheets, to primitive GUI programs. For example,an older optical link budget calculator tool created by Emily Kukura previously used command line queriesa ss h o w ni nF i g u r e1 . Figure 1.
