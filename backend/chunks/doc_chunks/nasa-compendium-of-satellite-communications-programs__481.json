Comments Main Station Air Transportable Air Transportable Helicopter Transportable Helicopter Transportable Same design as USAF satellite tracking station equipment available for the link in question. In a real sense the central require­ ment goes beyond multiple access and includes an element of random access. 15.2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION It was decided that two independent satellite bands (20 MHz and 2 MHz) would be required, based on the two types of communication requirements: long distance strategic point-to-point digital communications for the larger terminals, and selected tactical communications with mobiles (ship and land). Table 15-3(2)(3) gives the frequencies of the two bands. Table 15-3. SKYNET Frequencies 2 MHz Channel (MHz) 20 MHz Channel (MHz) Beacon (MHz) Uplink 7976.02 to 7978.02 7985.12 to 8005.12 - Downlink 7257.30 to 7259.30 7266.40 to 7286.40 7299.50 With two independent bands, modulation and multiple access could be tailored to satisfy all system requirements. Other specified features to be included in the system were reliability of communications and flexibility in terms of interconnections and traffic. The requirements of SKYNET communications fix the choice of terminals. The satellite antenna pattern was designed for coverage from the United Kingdom in the West to Singapore in the East. The U.K. Is other areas of interest fall between these two extremes. Traffic requirements were telegraphy, speech, and medium speed data"}
