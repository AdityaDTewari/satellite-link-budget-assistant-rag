Additionally, no audio to video crossmodulation interference observed and video to audio crossmodulation not signifi­ cant. 5. Doppler Shift Measured and calculated curves of Doppler shift agreed within 1 kHz over period of about 45 mins. 6. Absolute Delay Measured and calculated delay agreed within about 20 psec. *Objective for intermodulation noise is maximum 36 dBrn total at 0-dB trans­ mission level divided among various sources. Delay distortion objective corresponds to a differential phase of 4.20, which is within 50 requirement for N. T. S.
