The purpose istoshow thesultabi]ity of 1989010985-015 ! ! ANSX3.102 andANSX3.141 forquantifying theend-to-end system performance of current andfuture advanced communication satellite systems such asACTS. This report isdivided into several major sections. Section 2presents an overview ofANS X3.102 and ANS X3.141 and how they are used toquantify communication system performance. Section 3presents adiscussion onhow ANSX3.102 and ANS X3.141 can beused toquantify the performance ofthe various type A,B,andCand TDMA satellite systems. Section 4presents a brief overview ofNASA's ACTS andhowitoperates from theuser's perspective. Itthen concentrates onhow toapply ANS X3.102 and ANS X3.141 system performance measurement concepts totheACTS system. Itconcludes with ashort discussion onthe design ofanACTS system performance experiment using the framework ofANS X3.141. The appendix gives anoverview oflink budget calculations. 2.OVERVIEW OFAMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS X3.102 A/_DX3.141 Inthepast, thedata ccmmunication community hashaddifficulty ingetting thebest (and least expensive) data communicatiou systems that fititsneeds. Tohelp solve this problem, ANSI approved thetwodata communication systems performamce standards: I.The American National Standard for Information Systems--Data Communication Systems and Services--User-oriented Performance i Parameters, ANSX3.102 (ANSI 1983). i 2.The American National Standard for Information System_--Data Communication Systems andServices--Measurement Methods forUser- oriented Performance Evaluation, ANSX3.141 (ANSI 1987). These two standards form the basis ofth_ \"functional approach\" todata communication system procurement described inSeitz andGrubb (1983). Thebenefits ofusing this functional approach andofthese ANSI standards are many. Tothe data communication system users, their requirements are precisely defined; they donotneed tobecome system designers and they can specify the system that best fits their needs and budgets without being constrained toaparticular design. Tothedata communication system designers and service providers, their ability toassess existing and proposed new services from theuser's perspective isimproved, allowing them toidentify areas for improvement and/or cost"}
