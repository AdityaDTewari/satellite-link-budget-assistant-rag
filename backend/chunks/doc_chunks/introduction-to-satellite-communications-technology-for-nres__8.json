COMMUNICATIONS ONBOARD A SATELLITE Earth orbiting satellites are a wonder of modern technology. Everything must withstand the rigors of space in addition to the strain of the launch. In space there are extreme cold and heat, radiation and micrometeorites, and storms on the Sun. Orbits must be obtained and maintained and critical systems must be monitored. There are as many “floor plans” to satellites as there are applications for the technology. 6 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN The main systems on a satellite are power, propulsion, guidance, sometimes science instruments, and of course communications and tracking. The minimum communications capability for any satellite, no matter its purpose, is a low-speed link capable of send and receive for commanding, tracking and telemetry. 6. COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES Communications satellites divide bandwidth between “transponders.” A transponder is the hardware needed to take signals in on one set of frequencies and re-send to the ground on other frequencies (like a bent Dipe). Usually a transponder is caDable of sending I and receiving about 45 Mb/sec. These are analog signal processors, so-the modulation technique will determine the bandwidth a user can actually expect. 1. C-band transponders are usually 36 MHz wide 2. Ku-band transponders are usually 54 MHz wide 3. Ka-band transponders are usually 100 MHz wide The total capacity of a “Comsat” is between 1/2 and 2 Gb/sec, much less than a pair of fiber strands. Frequency reuse is obtained by use of beams. They separate the direction of the transmissions and reception by pointing the antenna at the ground in different directions. Thus a satellite can send the same frequencies on a beam to Chicago and also on a beam to New York Additional bandwidth is obtained by use of polarization that doubles usable bandwidth.
