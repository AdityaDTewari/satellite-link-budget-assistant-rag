The satellite control system receives and processes telemetry data and generates and transmits commands for the, control of the spacecraft. Spacecraft control includes altitude control, station keeping and other command functions of the space segment. Con­ trol is exercised by the AFSCF in a manner mutually agreed upon by SHAPE and AFSCF, thus minimizing system interference-and maximizing overall effectiveness. 2. Earth terminal control is exercised-by allocating to the terminal a portion of the satellite output power in such a way that the overall- system per­ formance is optimized. Control of the distribution of satellite output power is exercised manually from the Primary Control Center (PCC) collocated with the Belgium earth station or from the Secondary Control Center (SCC) collocated with theV German earth station. , Equipment has been provided for the continuous monitoring, and mesur­ ing of the system.
