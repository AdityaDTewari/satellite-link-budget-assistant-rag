Additionally, it is known that the Molniya satellites have been employed to provide measurements of the earth's -environment. The orbital paths of these satellites carry them through the earth's radiation belts several times each day, and studies are being made not only of the radiation belts but also of the effects they have on spacecraft equipment, es­ pecially solar cells. 11.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The Molniya-1 system was designed for relaying wideband transmission of either duplex multichannel telephone communications (including telegraph and fac­ simile) or television (black and white or color). Initially, operations were point-to­ point between Moscow and Vladivostok to provide regular telephone and 'telegraph exchange between the center of the country and the Far East, and to transmit central television programs to viewers in the Maritime territory. The first TV transmission via a Molniya-1 satellite was made on April 25,, 1965, just 2 days after the launch of the first vehicle. Under a Franco-Soviet research program which used Molniya-1, color television broadcasts have been successfully transmitted between Moscow and Paris since December 1967. This research program was preceded by a successful Moscow-Paris demonstration for which the results were reported in documents of the '1966 URSI (CCIR) Meeting in Oslo, Norway. (2) Later, experimental transmissions of newspaper pages and television programs were carried out via Molniya-1. Satisfactory imprinting of newspaper pages from 11-25 Pravda was achieved via transmissions from Khabarovsk (near Vladivostok). How­ ever, the rapid changes in propagation path length on the accent and descent of the elliptical orbit did result in some peculiarities, such as an apparent bending in the received newspaper type page. As of mid-1971, equipment was being added to Orbjita stations to further expand their telecommunications capability to permit"}
