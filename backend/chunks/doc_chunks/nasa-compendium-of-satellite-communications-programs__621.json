It also functions as a backup TT&C and test antenna for in-service satellites. The other terminals contain two antennas, one for each Westar satellite. The major characteristics of the communications and TT&C earth terminals are summa­ rized inTable 20-12. Further description is given in the Glenwood earth station block diagram shown in Figure 20-25.
