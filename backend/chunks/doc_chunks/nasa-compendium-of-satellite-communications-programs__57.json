The control unit responded to. command signals from the ground and activated the receiver, the transmitter, or the magnetic tape recorder. Three modes of operation were commanded -record, playback, and real time. Since the satellite was expected to orbit for only 20 days, a non-rechargeable high capacity zinc-silver oxide battery was employefd rather than heavier and more costly solar and nickle cadmium cells. The Atlas missile itself was used as the antenna and was excited by slots located in the two pod covers. The resulting radiation pattern was similar to a long wire doublet with associated nulls. Spacecraft characteristics for,the SCORE satellite are displayed in Table 2-4. A system diagram of the satellite is shown in Figure 2-1. •~~XMTR. Figure 2-1. SCORE: Communications Interconnect Diagram 2-3 VHF frequencies were used to minimize the effects of cosmic noise and ionospheric propagation while still permitting the use of sensitive, transistorized receiving equipment in the satellite. The operating frequencies employed in Project SCORE are given in Table 2-2. The IF bandwidth chosen was as narrow as possible consistent with frequency stability, Doppler shift, maximum audio frequency, and carrier frequency deviation. Table 2-2. Frequencies Employed in.
