TheTransfer Denial Probability expresses thelikelihood ofanunacceptable degradation intheperformsnce ofadata communication service during user information transfer. Transfer denial isdefined tooccur whenever the performance observed during atransfer sample isworse than thethreshold of acceptability for any ofthe four supported user information transfer parameters: Bit Error Probability, Bit Loss Probability, Extra Bit Probability, and user information transfer Rate.
