The former was determined 13-28 to be a temperature problem and operation with.three TWTs was -found to be sustain­ able. The latteroccurred during periods when the spacecraft load exceeded solar array output to the extent that the batteries were depleted resulting in an abnbrmally low battery voltage. Operational difficulties on ATS-3 included the failure of one 12-watt TWT to operate, a spurious SHF emission at 4201 MHz when operating in the FT mode, spacecraft response to commands intended for ATS-I, and a malfunction of the mechanically despun antenna (MDA). The spurious SHF emission was conjectured to te due to thermal effects, occuring during eclipse, creating an electrical or mechanical/electrical path,to allow sustained passage of sufficient electrical energy to activate the VCO employed in the SSB-FDMA/PM mode. Responses to ATS-1 commands were determined to be due to the address assignments made and not due to equipment abnormalities. As a result, the address assignments for ATS-4 and 5 were changed. The despun antenna malfunction was verified to be produced by stalling of the MDA motor as discussed in Paragraph 13.2.5. 13.2.6.1 Additional Services ATS-1 . Some services performed by ATS-1 in addition to technological and scientific ex­ periments were the relay of special TV programs such as the first splashdown of the Apollo moonflight, EXPO 67 in Australia, and the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to Australia; the performance of special SHIF tests such as mass data transfer and antenna beam control during the eclipse; relay of special VHF communications such as emer­ gency communications during the Alaskan flood and magnetic studies at field line base; and relay of special weather facsimile for air operations in the Pacific. ATS-1 also gave real-time data support to the ground stations operating with INTELSAT II"}
