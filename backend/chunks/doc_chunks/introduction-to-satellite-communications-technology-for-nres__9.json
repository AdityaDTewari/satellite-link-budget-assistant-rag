Thus a satellite can send the same frequencies on a beam to Chicago and also on a beam to New York Additional bandwidth is obtained by use of polarization that doubles usable bandwidth. Solar weather can very adversely affect communications satellites, sometimes to the extent that a flare will actually render a communications satellite inoperable. Geosynchronous communications satellites have a predictable power signature for areas covered by their transponders. This footprint makes it possible to know the required dish size and power requirements before an Earth station is assembled at a site. Errors can be minimized and higher bandwidth obtained by using a bigger dish, more power, or better coding. 7. DWCTIONS IN THE SATELLITE INDUSTRY The great down-turn that has hit the technology and communications industry in general has not spared the satellite industry. Some nations, such as Japan, have drastically cut back their space research and development. Even the International Space Station may never reach its low goals. Both commercial and government (except military) launch schedules have been cut back making it unlikely that all of the players who build and launch satellites will last the next few years. Even amid this “consolidation, competition, retrenchment and turbulence” there are positive trends that will survive this turndown and thrive in the early 21’‘ century. Some of the trends include the following: 1. Spurred by the military, there will be more big “birds” with more bandwidth and new spectrum. 7 Introduction to Satellite Communication Technology for NREN 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. New coding technologies now perfected will double bandwidth of even existing satellites. Launch costs will decline substantially. The new paradigm is universal, bi-directional access, including television, Internet and new media over the next-generation satellite"}
