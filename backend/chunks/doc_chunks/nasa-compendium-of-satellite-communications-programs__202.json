The solar cell experiment studied radiation effects pertinent to solar power arrays made from the standard silicon cells normally used and effects on experimental cells of various types. The latter included lithium-doped cells made from silicon grown by crucible, float zone and Lopex techniques; cells made from silicon grown by the dendretic support process; cells manufactured by ion and Cd Te thin film cells (4 4 ) implant techniques; CdS thin film cells, . The space radiation experiment was designed to measure the trapped electron spectrum over the range of 275 keV to 3 MeV (21 )( 4 5 ) . The earth albedo experiment measured the reflected optical spectrum from the earth in 6 spectral bands from 0. 41 microns to 1.00 microns (2 1 ). The RFI experiment was very similar to that on LES-5 except it measured interference in the band from 290 to 315 MHz(4 3 ) . Precision spin period measurements were a by-product of a special.clock rate generator included on LES-6 as part of the automatic stationkeeping system. The high efficiency trans­ mitter operated directly from the solar bus. The power amplifier load line was adjusted to be coincident with the locus of maximum power points as the output from (21-) . the solar array varied with sun illumination and satellite life( There were no dc-dc converter losses in order to obtain proper regulated voltages and no unutilized power for solar array radiation degradation margins. 9.3.4 Ground Terminals The major station involved 4i UHF LES testing was Lincoln Laboratory's Lexington terminal. -Early military terninhals involved in the program were the Electronic Communication, Inc., (ECI).teiminal.s employed by the Air Force(3 3 ) 9-34 and Navy and the Project East vehicular earth terminals ( 3"}
