The type of system realized was the result of economic considerations dictating that a space segment, initially designed and developed before synchronous technology was proven feasible, be implemented. The system employed conventional modulation and multiple­ access techniques, except for high data rate (1Mbps) MFSK modems for facsimile transmission and an operational pseudonoise antijam capability. Extensive evaluations of approaches to realizing high gain, pencil beam, earth coverage antennas were conducted during this period. Techniques for realizing despun 1-18 antennas on spin-stabilized spacecraft were exhaustively considered, and gravity gradient stabilization, such that rigidly mounted spacecraft antennas were continuously pointed towards the earth, was seriously investigated for the first time. Electronically despun phased arrays were flown on a synchronous ATS satellite in late 1966, and on a near synchronous test spacecraft launched as part of the IDCSP program in mid-1967. These tests demonstrated that this type of antenna system was feasible, and gains of up to 14 dB were realized. Electronic switching asia means to realize a despun antenna was given further consideration in the synchronous UHF LES satellite launched in late 1968. The feasibility of this approach was again demonstrated, and a.gain of about 10 dB realized. However, questions on the optimum approach to antenna despinning were laid to rest when an ATS spacecraft launched in late 1967 demonstrated the feasibility of mechanically despun antennas. By late 1968, it was apparent that the latter approach provided reliable performance and antenna gains of about 16 dB. Additionally, weight and prime power consumption were competitive with or superior to that realized by other approaches. Gravity gradient stabilization was of interest because of the potentially high reliabilities available from such"}
