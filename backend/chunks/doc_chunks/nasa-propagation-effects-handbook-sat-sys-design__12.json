Likewise therain rate averaged over several hours isexpected toberather similar forground siteslocated upto tens ofkilometers apart. Convective storms,however,arelocalized andtend togive rise to spatially nonuniform distributions ofrainfall andrain rate foragiven storm. S.C. Bloch, etal(1978) atEASCON 78,showedamovie ofan image-enhanced weather radar display which clearly showedthedecay and redevelopment ofaconvective cellwhile passing over Tampa Bay. Clearly the total rainfall andrain rate varies significantly over thescale of10kmfor this region. Theeffect isattributed tothepresence ofthelarge water mass andtheheat-islandassociated with Tampa. Over more uniform terrain, Huff andShipp (1969) have observed precipitation correlation coefficients of0.95 over 5mile extents for thunderstorms andrainshowers inIllinois. Thecorrelation wasalso higher along thepathofstormmotion compared toperpendicular tothepath, aswould beexpected. Note that this correlation iscomputed fortheperiodofthe storm andisnottheinstantaneous spatial correlation coefficient required to estimate theeffectiveness ofground stationsitediversity. 2.2.5 Short-Term Horizontal Distributions Radars operatingatnonattenuating frequencies have been utilizedto study both thehorizontal andvertical spatial components ofconvective rain systems. Atypical horizontal distribution (actually observedat1.4degrees elevation angle) isshowninFigure2.2-1 forathunder showerinNewEngland (Crane andBlood -1979). Here rain rate variations of100:1 areobserved over ranges of10kmforashowercontaining four intense cells. Similar measurements have beenmade byGoldhirsh (1976), atWallops Island, VA.
