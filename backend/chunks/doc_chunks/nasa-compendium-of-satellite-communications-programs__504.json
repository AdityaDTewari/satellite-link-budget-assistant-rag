Communications service will be provided by voice, data and teletype using FM modulation as in Phase I. In addition, each link will be equipped with CDMA equip­ ment to provide vocoded voice/data and several teletype channels on each link during jamming conitibns. Ten additional fixed type earth terminals will be procured to augment the- 12 Phase II earth terminals, and two medium-capacity transportable 6-meter (20-foot) antenna terminals will be procured for use by the Alternate Shape Headquarters and the Allied Mobile Forces. Two high-power satellites--one to be used as an in-orbit spare--were procured in early 1973 for launch in late 1975. These satellites.will contain two-separate com munication repeaters and antennas. One repeater will be connected to a widebeam­ 16-10 ,Table 16-6. NATO SATCOM Phase III Requirements 1. Communication Service: 2. Earth Terminals: 3. Modulation: 4. Multiplex: 5.
