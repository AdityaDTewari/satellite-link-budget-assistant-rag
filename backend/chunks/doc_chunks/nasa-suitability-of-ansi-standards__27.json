(Feher i1983] discusses uniqueword detection andprobabilities ofmissesandfalse alarms.) Also,if theuser's system clock isnot synchronized tothe earth station clock, a \"clock sllp\" can occur.This iswhen theclock reading data out ofaTDMA buffer differs from theclock writing datainto thebuffer. Iftheread clock isslightly slower then thewrite clock, thebuffer will eventually overflow andhits will belost. Additionally, deep fades onthelink would cause large blocks ofbits tobeerrored orlost. BitLoss Probability isincluded inthe setofTDMA system performance parameters. ExtraBitProbability < TheExtra BitProbability istheprobability that areceived data bitwasa i duplicate bit orabit intended for another destination. Like the Bit I l Misdelivery Probability andBitLoss Probability, theExtra BitProbability is very low for connection-oriented systems. However, ifthe TDMA frame- synchronizing UWisdeclared present, when inreality itisnot, the TDMA control buffer empties prematurely, thus sending extraneous orduplicate bits. Also, extrabits can begenerated by\"clock slips.\" Iftheread clock is slightly faster then thewrite clock, thebuffer will empty, causing data bits tobeclocked outtwice andtobecounted asextra bits. The Extra BitProbability and theBitLoss Probability give ameasure of the UWdetector performance and the local earth station clock stability. Therefore, Extra Bit Probability isincluded inthe set ofTDMA system performance perameters. BlockTransfer Time BlockTransfer TimeforTDMA systems isthetime required fordatablocks i! tobefeed into andtraverse thesystem. Thecounting ofBlock Transfer Time 311989010985-041 starts with auser information block crossing the originating user/system interface and ends when the same block crosses the destination user/system interface. Any additional delay beyond the 270 mspropagation delay ofa single-hop satellite circuit and themodulation time gives ameasure ofthe additional buffering required inTDMA systems. Therefore, Block Transfer Time isincluded inthesetofTDMA performance. Block Error Probability Block Error Probability isclosely related totheBit Error Probability, theprobability that ablock ofuser information isreceived inerror. Oneor more incorrect bits inablock constitute ablock error. Therefore, the measurement ofBlock Error Probability isalso included"}
