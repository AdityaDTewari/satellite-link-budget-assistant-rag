Visibility is assumed to exist when a TDRS falls within the user's antenna beam. Cases are examined for the two orbital inclinations (33 and 990) which dominate the mission model and for antennas which are either fixed, partially gimballed, or capable of being fully gimballed. The resulting data, plotted in a series of curves, will aid in preliminary determination of the gimballing and beamwidth constraints for each user depending on the fraction of the orbital period over which communication via the TDRS is desired. Section 4 consists of a comparative examination of candidate antennas for the user spacecraft. The alternatives presented include low gain antennas which are usually fixed rather than.gimballed, and medium gain antennas which require either gimballing or switching between separate antennas for optimum telecommunication visibility with the TDRS's. Presented for consideration also in this section is a series of spacecraft antennas for which actual hardware experience has been accumulated. These include antennas from such early space programs as Surveyor and SYNCOM to the most recent such as the Canadian domestic communications satellite, Anik, and proposed missions such as the HS-507 Pioneer Venus spacecraft. 2-8 3. USER/TDRS COVERAGE AND MUTUAL VISIBILITY STUDY 3.1 Methodology and Ground Rules The purpose of this section is to determine the maximum and minimum periods of mutual visibility between a typical user spacecraft and at least one of two TDRS's. It is assumed that mutual visibility exists when a TDRS falls within the antenna beam of the user satellite. The TDRS space- craft"}
