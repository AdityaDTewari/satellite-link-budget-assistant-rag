When the received power is greater then the minimum acceptable carrier power, then the link is ‘closed’: Pr>= CminLink closed Pr< CminLink not closed 2.To ensure acceptable operation in the communication system, assign a “ Link Margin ” in the Link Budget calculations, which tells how tight we are in closing the link : Link Margin = Pr–Cmin(usually expressed in dB) 3.Equivalently: Link Margin > 0 Link closed. Link Margin < 0 Link not closed.

EiRP : PtGTx, dB. FSPL : Free space path loss, dB. La: Atmospheric losses , dB. Note: Lais a random variable that changes due to condition of the atmosphere between Txand Rx. Two thresholds are defined: 1.Performance threshold: Link’s performance above targeted value. 2.Availability threshold: Link is not available due to bad performance.

It has final mean power and infinitive energy. Therefore, power is a useful parameter for analog communications. 3.With digital communications, symbols are transmitted in a time: TS. If only one symbol is observed, mean power in all the time interval approaches zero. Therefore, power is not a satisfactory parameter for digital"}
