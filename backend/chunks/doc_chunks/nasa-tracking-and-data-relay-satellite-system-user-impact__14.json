For Cases 1 and 2 analysis indicates that communi- cation time is essentially independent of user orbital altitude for 300 km ! h : 1000 km, and thus altitude does not appear as a parameter in the results for these cases. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and minimum visibility times that will be experienced between the user and at least one TDRS for Case 1 (no gimballing). The visibility times are expressed as a percentage of the user's orbital period and as a function of user antenna beamwidth. Figure 3.4a is for a user orbital inclination of 330 00and Figure 3.4b is for i = 99 . As can be seen from the first curve a minimum of zero communication time exists for beamwidths of 650 or less. This means that for this"}
