Monopulse tracking techniques can be used to automatically track the spacecraft. Polarization tracking at C-band is also provided. Communication signals are transmitted, received, and processed as re­ quired by the various ATS experiments. In addition, a communications test and eval­ uation console (CTEC) is used for evaluation of the spacecraft communications link. A master control console (MCC) provides a focal point for ground station co­ ordination. At the MCC, the mission director receives status indications and infor­ mation that enable him to direct operations by issuing voice commands to the subsystem operators. Spacecraft commands are encoded, transmitted and verified by the T&C subsys­ tem. Spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and discrete real-time functions are also received, processed, recorded and displayed by the telemetry subsystem. 13-82 Figure 13-20 below shows the Rosman Block Diagram.

Rosman Ground Station Block Diagram 13.4.4.3 Mojave Ground Station ( 4 1 ) The Mojave facility uses the 12-meter (40-foot) parabolic antenna for C-band and the 4.6-meter (15-foot) antenna (not shown in the photograph) for S-and L-bands. .L13-83 The 12-meter (40-foot) antenna uses monopulse techniques to track the spacecraft at C-band. Polarization tracking is also provided. The C-, S-, and L-band com­ munications system is the same as Rosman except for the size of the C-band antenna. As in the Rosman station, an MOO is the focal point for coordination within the station. Status indications and information are received at.the MOOC that enable the mission director to direct operations by voice commands to the operators of the sta­ tion subsystems. Communication with ATSOCC is accomplished by one voice circuit and one full duplex TTY circuit. Figure 13-21 shows the Mojave Ground Station Block Diagram. H Figure 13-21.
