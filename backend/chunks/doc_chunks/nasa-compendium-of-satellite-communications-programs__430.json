The experiment will measure the mutual interference between satellite and ment and implementation of advanced spacecraft terrestrial communications systems and the data obtained will be used to improve the design of future communications satellites. communications systems. Two separate RFI experiments are planned, one at C-band and the other at VHF. (39) 13-117 For this experiment, ATS-6's 9.1-meter (30-foot) parabolic antenna will be used to collect microwave IF signals in the 5925 to 6425 MHz frequency bands that reach the synchronous-orbit altitude from earth. These signals will-be transmitted to a wide­ band RFI transponder (500 MHz) onboard the spacecraft, automatically converted to a 4 MHz signal, and relayed to the ATS ground station at Rosman, N. C. At Rosman the signals will be fed to a computerized receiver analyzer for initial data processing and recording prior to delivery to Goddard for final analysis. All other communi­ cations systems on the sijacecraft will be turned off during the RFI experiment to minimize local interference. Initially, ATS-F will scan the entire U.S. to identify \"hot spots\" of RFI. Then a narrow band analytical system will be used to determine the frequency, power level, and the geographic location of each area of interference. By positioning the 9-meter antenna such that its \"shadow\" covers the hot spot from three different angles, tri­ angulation techniques can be used to -pinpoint locations within an area of 16 kilometers (10 miles) radius. (42) The RFI measurements will be performed using standard noise-power-ratio (NPR) tests with the earth terminal configured in a back-to-back loop through the satellite. The reference NPR measurements will be made using the"}
