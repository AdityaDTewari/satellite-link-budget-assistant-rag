At Goonhilly Downs good quality of the satellite video channel was obtained; multipath and echo signals were imperceptible. Further, doppler frequency shifts are observed to have no effect on the quality of the received monochrome video signal. 2. Telephony -Links were always excellent with respect to the contact established and noise in the telephone channels. 3. Facsimile -Some dpformation (skew) caused by the variation in propagation time during the transmission could be seen. For photographs lacking in fine detail the effect was tolerable; for newspaper pages or drawings the effect could be sufficiently large to be troublesome. 4. Radiation Experiment -The n-on-p solar cells were shown to be more resistant to radiation than p-on-n cells. Some mapping of the electron and proton fields in the Relay orbit was also accomplished. 7.6 OPERATIONAL RESULTS The objectives of the Relay program were entirely experimental in nature; therefore, no operational traffic was handled. The program was extraordinarily successful with malfunctions in either the satellites or ground complex being infre­ quent. However, it was not entirely free of operational difficulties. Most trouble­ some was an,inability to turn off one, of the high power regulators and its associated wideband repeater on Relay I. Analysis indicated that excessive reverse leakage current in the high power regulator series pass transistors prevented the regulator from being shut off. The cause of this excessive, reverse leakage current was appar­ ently moisture precipitating on the active surface of the transistor as the junction temperature passed through the transistor's dew point temperature. After about 12 7-11 months operation the problem seemed to disappear, perhaps due to the evaporation of the condensation into the vacuum of space. In addition, spurious responses by the spacecraft were observed rather frequently by noting the satellite equipment being turned on and off in"}
