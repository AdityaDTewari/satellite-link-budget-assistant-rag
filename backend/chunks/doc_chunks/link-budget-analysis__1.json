B.Desired communication quality. C.Coding gain. D.Additional overheads. E.Channel Bandwidth. F.Thermal Noise power. 4.Any uncertainty can be covered by providing an appropriate amount of link margin , which is over and above the C/N needed to account for propagation effects and nonlinearity in the system .
