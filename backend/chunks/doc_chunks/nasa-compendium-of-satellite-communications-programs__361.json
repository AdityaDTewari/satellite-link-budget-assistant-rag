In addition, some telemetry and tracking was provided by terminals at Johannesburg, South Africa; Tananarive, Madagascar; and Kauai, Hawaii. Satellite launchings were provided by NASA. The launch difficulties on ATS-2 and 4 precluded any significant contributions to satellite communications by the experiments on board these spacecraft. However, ATS-5 did make several contributions, first, its millimeter wave experiment has provided valuable data that will contribute towards opening this band for satellite 13-34 communications; secondly, its L-Band experiment has given a preliminary indication of the potential that these frequencies hold for aircraft and maritime control, com­ munications, and navigation; and third, this satellite displayed the 'poiential difficul­ ties involved in injecting a gravity gradient stabiltzed satellite into a synchronous orbit and deploying it to a desired station. 13.3.2 System Description The SHF (i.e. C-Band) tests conducted Were done primarily on a loop back or half duplex basis. The system configuration for the millimeter wave tests was as shown in Figure 13-7. The figure indicates, uplink propagation measurements were performed in the satellite and telemeter&d'to the ground. Downlink measurements are performed on the ground. A system block diagram of the initially planned L-Band communications test configuration is shown in Figure 13-8. Signals are sent from the ground stations to the satellite at C-Band. These signals are combined in the satellite and retransmitted to the aircraft at L-Band. The ground stations monitor the L-Band transmissions from the sat6llite for' frequency control and ground-to­ satellite range measurements. Aircraft transmissions arrive at the satellite at L-Band where they are combined and transferred to C-Band for transmission to the ground stations. An L-Band ground station transmit capability. is also provided to allow full testing of the satellite from the ground. The earth coverage supplied by"}
