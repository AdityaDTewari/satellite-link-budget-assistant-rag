That is, of the potential 1,000 MHz bandwidth mode available by frequency reuse techniques, 160 MHz (four 40 MHz transponders) will be lost in order to provide unique services on a global scale. Within these bounds, the 20-transponder INTELSAT IVA is expected to be con­ figured to handle 12,500 voice grade channels (plus one TV and one SPADE transponder) for a typical Atlantic Primary Satellite frequency plan configuration. 10-26 In comparison an INTELSAT IV Atlantic Primary Satellite can be configured for 7,500 channels (plus one TV and one SPADE transponder). Therefore the net in­ crease for IVA over IV is about 5,000 chanels. 10.3 SPACECRAFT The Early Bird satellite was very similar to the Syncom III spacecraft. Early Bird's microwave repeater consisted of two independent nonlinear, hard-limiting, frequency translating transponders. Both transponders shared a single TWT output power amplifier. A second TWT was carried on-board the spacecraft for redundancy; however, only one of the tubes was on at a time. A block diagram of the Early Bird repeater is provided in Figure 10-1. The satellite was spin-stabilized for attitude control and the elimination of temperature extremes. The pancake-shaped antenna pattern was squinted to provide high gain coverage of the northern hemisphere alone. Spacecraft design lifetime was only 18 months. However, Early Bird operated suc­ cessfully for more than 3 years until it was retired from service. Communications characteristics of this satellite are provided in Table 10-13. The INTELSAT IIsatellite design evolved directly from that of Early Bird. Among the most significant changes were the adoptidn of a single redundant wideband linear amplifier and an antenna beam that covered both the northern and southern hemispheres. The transponder bandwidth was 125 MHz compared with the two re­ peaters of 25-MHz bandwidth, each used"}
