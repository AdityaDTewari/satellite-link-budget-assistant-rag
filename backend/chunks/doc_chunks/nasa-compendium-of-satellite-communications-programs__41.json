By late .1967, three Intelsat Is had been successfully 1-17 launched, and commercial communications service was being provided over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The advent of reliable tunnel diode amplifiers to serve as relatively low-noise, high-gain satellite input preamplifiers allowed single RF conversion transponders to be provided on these satellites. Allowable satellite weight and prime power in combination with new high performance earth terminals permitted these transponders to be designed for linear input/output power transfer characteris­ tics. These wideband satellites and an expanded ground complex resulted in extensive satellite multiple access in an operational system for the first time. Conventional FM-FDMA was employed, and system control techniques were developed to provide a high reliability operational system. Concurrent with these Intelsat activities, continued launches of the Molniya I spacecraft maintained an operational Russian system. With the addition of new ground terminals, service in this system was considerably expanded in 1967 when the U.S.S.R. inaugurated a space television distribution system, allowing people in Siberia, the Far East, and the Far North to view broadcasts from Moscow. In late 1966, the first group of 7 IDCSP satellites were successfully injected into near synchronous orbits, using a single launch vehicle, and by mid-1968 three more successful launches had established a system including more than 20 satellites. This military system began to meet emergency operational requirements in December, 1966, and by mid-1967 it was declared completely operational. In this system of multiple, near synchronous satellites, outage periods due to no spacecraft being visible and during satellite handovers were overcome by scheduling around these events. The type of system realized was the result of economic considerations dictating that a space segment, initially designed and developed before synchronous technology was proven"}
