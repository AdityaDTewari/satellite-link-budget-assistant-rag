New coding technologies now perfected will double bandwidth of even existing satellites. Launch costs will decline substantially. The new paradigm is universal, bi-directional access, including television, Internet and new media over the next-generation satellite systems. There will be more IP in space. Multicast will become accepted after adoption on satellite-based ISP backbcjiies. IP services will be integrated with TV broadcast, first using DVB-S (digital video broadcasting-satellite) technology and then straight IP. Novel applications __ (like the roll out of satellite car radio) will be developed. Earth science applications will require more spectrum and direct access for users internationally. “On demand” will be the next wave. As global warming and other environmental issues come to the forefront, Earth Observing satellites will become more prominent. Satellites have been with us nearly half a century and have evolved considerably. The next 50 years will bring more technological changes that will affect our lifestyles. 8"}
