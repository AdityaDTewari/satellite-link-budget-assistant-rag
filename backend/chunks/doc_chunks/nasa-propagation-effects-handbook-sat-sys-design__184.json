Degradation isnot\"graceful.\" 7.2.2.2 Data System Performance. Data communications systems rarely transmit uniform, homogeneous, continuous bitstreams. Rather, thedata isoften formatted inblocks orpackets. Inmany cases, then, theperformance requirement isspecified interms oftheprobability ofanerror free block, which might typically contain 1000ormore bits. Iftheonly type of transmission imperfection istherandomly occuring biterror process, then the block error performance canbecalculated from thebiterror rate: Probability oferror free block ofnbits =P(ZI,n) =(1-BER)n.However, theblock error performance maybeinfluenced bytheprobability oflonger outages, losses ofsynchronization, andthelike, which arenotusually included intheBER. Insystems usedtotransfer well-defined messages, otherperformance criteria mayberequired. Inthemost general case where ablock iscomposed ofmany messages, thesystem performance requirements could include amessage performance criterion, ablock transmission performance criterion andabit error rate. Note that consistency among thevarious criteria ismandatory. Forexample, ablock error performance of99_(i.e., ggoutof100blocks are error free) for1000-bit blocks could notbeachieved when thebiterror rate is10-4. Indata communications systems where real time delivery isnot critical, theconcept ofthroughput isoften used. Itisimplicit that the system involves areturn channel path overwhich acknowledgments and/or requests forretransmission aremade. Thethroughput isdefined (Brayer - 1978) astheratio ofthenumber ofinformation bits transmitted (K)tothe 357 total numberofbits (including overhead andre-transmissions), n,before the block isaccepted. Thethroughput isapproximately K{I-P(->I,n)]/n This approximation forthroughputasafunction ofblock error rate applies onlywhen thereturn channel iserror free. Brayer (1978) makes acase for using message deliverydelay asthemost important criterion, rather than throughput itself. However, they arerelatdd closely. Insummaryitcanbeseen that throughput andblock error rate are directly related. Biterror rate contributes amajor, butnotalways the only, portion oftheblockerror rate. Incommunication system design, the (shortterm) biterror rate orbiterror probability istaken asaparameter ofanalysis andpreliminarydesign. Finalperformance estimates must, however, take into account both thenominal BERperformance, andsome consideration ofoutages. Thequalitative relationships among thevarious criteria areshown inFigure 7.2-1. Notice that thefundamental, or user-requirement- oriented, criteria areontheright side ofthediagram,"}
