Experimentation for most part terminated six months after first launch of 7 and IDCSP satellites and system de­ clared operational. Automatic satellite turn-offs to start in 1972 and be completed by mid-1974 failed to operate. GGTS 1 and DODGE were em­ ployed for a time to evaluate gravity gradient stabilization.
