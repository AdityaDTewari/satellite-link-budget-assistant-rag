ITU-R P.676 -13 1 RECOMMENDATION ITU-R P. 676-13* Attenuation by atmospheric gases and related effects (Question ITU -R 201/3 ) (1990 -1992 -1995 -1997 -1999 -2001 -2005 -2007 -2009 -2012 -2013 -2016 -2019 -2022 ) Scope This Recommendation provides: a) methods in Annex 1 to calculate the slant path gaseous attenuation, phase nonlinearity, atmospheric bending, excess atmospheric path length and downwelling and upwelling noise temperatures due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 1 000 GHz for arbitrary known pressure, temperature and water vapour height profiles; b) an approximate method in Annex 2 to estimate the instantaneous slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 350 GHz when the instantaneous surface pressure, surface temperature and surface water vapour densit y or integrated water vapour content1 are known from local data, a reference profile, or referenced digital maps; c) an approximate method in Annex 2 to estimate the statistics of slant path gaseous attenuation due to oxygen and water vapour for the frequency range from 1 to 350 GHz when the surface pressure, surface temperature and surface water vapour density or int egrated water vapour content statistics are known either from local data, a reference profile, or referenced digital maps; d) a Weibull approximation to the slant path water vapour attenuation for use in Recommendation ITU-R P.1853 .
