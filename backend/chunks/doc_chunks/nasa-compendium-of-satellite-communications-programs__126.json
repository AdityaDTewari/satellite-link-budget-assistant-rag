Two-way 12-channel telephony Poorest channel typically had noise performance about equal to that for 600 telephone channel transmissions. Crosstalk between carriers was no problem. 6. High- and low-speed data including facsimile -Data rates from those for 60-wpm teletypewriter signals to 875 kbps were tried. Test results satisfactory to excellent compared to results obtainable on a 6437-kilometer (4000-mile) micro­ -Wave 'radio relay system. Changes in absolute time delay caused some timing problems for high-speed data and facsimile. Doppler shift caused some distortion in low-speed data signals. Notes: Filtered to about 2 MHz to allow audio signal to frequency modulate a 4. 5-MHz aural subcarrier. ** A color program demonstration with audio was conducted in early January 1963 in which the audio modulation was inserted during the time interval reserved for horizontal blanking. * No baseband filter employed. **** About 16 dB of degradation due to reducing peak frequency deviations from 7 MHz to 1 MHz. Remaining degradation from reduced satellite transmitter power per carrier. t When satellite is at maximum range. 6-12 The communication experiments, noted in Table'6-8, are defined in detail in Table 6-10.

Ini considering received carrier power fading measurements, note that the horizons at Andover and Goonhilly are at about 20 and 0.-50 in elevation, tkespedtively. Most of the impairments to"}
