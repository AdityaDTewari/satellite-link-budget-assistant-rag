Itends when the first bit ofsource user information isinput tothesystem (after connection establishment in connection-oriented services). It includes all activities traditionally associated with physical circuit establishment (e.g., dialing, switching, andringing) aswell asanyactivities performed at higher protocol levels (e.g., X.25 virtual circuit establishment). 1989010985-019 IO1989010985-020 The speed performance criterion isdescribed byAccess Time, theelapsed i time between theoriginating user issuing anaccess request (e.g., pick upthe 4 phone) andthefirst bitofuser information entering thesystem. The accuracy performance criterion isdescribed bytheIncorrect Access Probability, the probability ofthe system making awrong connection. This parameter generally applies toconnection-oriented systems only, where the misconnection istypically due toswitching oraddress errors. The user dialing awrong number isnotincluded inthis parameter because that isnota system-caused error. The reliability performance criterion isdescribed bythe performance parameters Access _Denial Probability andAccess Outage Probability. Access Denial Probability isthe probability that thesystem will block theuser's call, e.g., \"all circuits arebusy.\" Access denial also occurs when thetime toaccess thesystem exceeds theAccess Time threshold depicted inFigure i. Asdefined inANSI (1983), theAccess Time threshold isthree times themean Access Time. Ifanaccess attempt exceeds this threshold itiscounted asan Access Denial. The Access Outage Probability isthe probability that the | system does notrespond totherequest forservice, e.g., theuser does notget a\"dial tone\" when he/she picks upthephone toplace acall. This outage is duetopart orallofthesystem being \"down.\" The ancillary performance parameter associated with access isthe User Fraction ofAccess Time. This isthelength oftime theusers areresponsible forprocessing theaccess request, e.g., thelength oftime ittakes to\"dial\" thenumber andanswer thephone. 2.1.2 User Information Transfer Eleven primary performance parameters and one ancillary performance parameter are defined for the user information transfer function. These parameters areBlock Transfer Time, User Information Bit Transfer Rate, Bit Error Probability, Block Error Probability, BitMisdelivery probability, Block Misdelivery Probability, Extra Bit Probability, Extra Block Probability,"}
