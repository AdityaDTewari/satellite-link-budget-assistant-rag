Communications to Mobile Duplex data links to ships (AN/SSC-3) and aircraft, (Wright Patterson Terminals Experimental Terminal), 75 bps to 2400 bps, ship to shore and air to ground 5. Interference and Jamming With a psendonoise spread spectrum modulator/demodulator it was demonstrated that duplex communications could be maintained with in­ band uplink interference/jammer power very much larger than the up­ link signal power. Operational tests demonstrated that the Defense Satellite Communication System would be effective under severe up­ link jamming conditions 6. Timing Transfer Using pseudonoise spread spectrum modulator/demodulators it was demonstrated that timing synchronization could be achieved at satellite earth stations, to better than one microsecond, on a world wide basis Table 12-8. Type Experiment 7. Low Elevation Propagation 8. Electronic Despun Antenna 9. Gravity Gradient Stabili- zation -DODGE (10) (Department of Defense Gravity Experiment) Summary of Program Experiments (2 of 2) Nature of Results Obtained Measurements were made of propagation medium effects on wide band­ widths (20 MHz), at 7.3 GHz over satellite to ground paths down to zero degrees elevation. Differential fading results were obtained that could not be explained in terms of any reasonable two component ray propagation model The Despun Antenna Test Satellite (DATS) demonstrated the practi­ cality of an electronically despun phased array antenna on a spin stabilized satellite to produce a continuously earth-direction beam. Successful tests were completed at low data rates (narrow bandwidth tracking loops), showing the effects of despinning on the communica­ tion signals Successfully detumbled satellite from an initial 0.6 rpm tumble rate. However, oscillations in pitch, roll, and yaw varied widely and only once in 17 satellite passes during 1967 were the oscillations damped to the level predicted by theory and required for a communication satellite. Also a number of times the satellite has resumed tumbling"}
