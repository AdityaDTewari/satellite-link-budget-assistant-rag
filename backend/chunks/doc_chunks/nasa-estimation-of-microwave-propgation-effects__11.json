Itis necessary toestimate the rain layer height appropriate tothepath in question before proceeding tothetotalattenuation computation since even the0°C isotherm height depends onlatitude and general rain condi- tions. Asamodel fortheprediction ofattenuation, theaverage height of the 0°Cisotherm fordays with rain was takentocorrespondtotheheight tobeexpected onepercent oftheyear.Thehighest height observed with rain was takentocorrespondtothevalue tobeexpected 0.001 per- centoftheyear, the average summer height ofthe-S°C isotherm. The latitude dependences oftheheights tobeexpected for surface point rain ratesexceededonepercent oftheyearand 0.001percent oftheyear were obtained from thelatitude dependences providedbyOort and Rasmussen. The resultantcurvesarepresented inFigure 13. Fortheestimationof modeluncertainty, theseasonal rms uncertainty inthe0°Cisotherm height was 500morroughly13percent oftheaverage estimated height. Thevalue of13percent isusedtoestimatetheexpected uncertainties tobeassociated with Figure 13. Thecorrespondence between the0aC isotherm height values and the excessive precipitation events showed atendencytowardalinear rela- tionshipbetweenRpand H°where H°is0aCisotherm height forhigh values ofR.Since, athigh rain rates, therain rate distribution function P displaysanearly linear relationship between Rpand logP[P isproba- bility ofoccurrence), theinterpolation modelused fortheestimationof H°for Pbetween0.001 andonepercent isassumed tohave theform, Ho= a+blogP.This relationship was used toprovide theintermediate values displayed inFigure 13.
