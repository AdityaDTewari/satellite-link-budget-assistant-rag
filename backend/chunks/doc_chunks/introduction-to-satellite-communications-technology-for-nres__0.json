INTRODUCTION NREN requirements for development of seamless nomadic networks necessitates that NREN staff have a working knowledge of basic satellite technology. This paper applications, technology trends, orbits, and spectrum, and hopefully will afford the reader an end-to-end picture of this important technology. Satellites are objects in orbits about the Earth. An orbit is a trajectory able to maintain gravitational equilibrium to circle the Earth without power assist. Physical laws that were comeptualized by Newton and Kepler govern orbital mechanics. The first satellite was the Moon, of course, but the idea of communications satellites came from Sir Arthur C. Clark in 1945. The Soviets launched the first manmade satellite, Sputnik I, in 1957. The first communications satellite (a simple reflector) was the US. Echo I in 1960. The first “geosynchronous” (explained later) satellite, Syncom, went up in 1962. There are now over 5000 operational satellites in orbit, 232 of which are large commercial (mostly communications) satellites. Satellites have become essential for modern life. Among the important applications of satellite technology are video, voice, IP data, radio, Earth and space observation, global resource monitoring, military, positioning (GPS), micro-gravity science and many others. From direct-to-home TV to the Hubble telescope, satellites are one of the defining technologies of the modem age. Video is the most successful commercial application for satellites, and direct-to-home distribution is the most promising application for the technology at this time. “Spot” images of places on Earth, GPS, and Internet access-both for providers and direct-to-home or oficehave been most successful, while cell phone systems based on fleets of low flying satellites have been a flop. Mobile phone-like connections for marine and mobile services have been with us for some time, however. Satellite services have some big advantages,"}
