GiN-xhj-In(12NCoj) Yj Coj Forthecase ofN=Iyear, this isbounded by: 12<Qj<12 M 1 Where Misthenumber ofmonths intheyear that intense rains typically fall. IfM<3,theexponential model should bequestioned. Thelower bound hasbeen shown tobeafair estimate ofQjlforrain rates with annual percentage exceedances inthe.001% to.01% range. Anapproximate procedure forgenerating theprobability that the\" Xhjexceedance threshold will beexceeded during theworst month isshown in Figure 6.3-17. Theprocess hasthree major steps. First, determine theworst month (30-day period); second, generate threshold X'hjsassociated with the linkrainmargin forNyears, and; third, estimate theprobability that the threshold formore than thespecified number ofminutes fortheworst-month. 6.3.7.1DeterminationofWorstMonth. Todeterminetheworst month, itis suggested that thefrequency ofthunderstorms (available from theU.S. Climatological Data Sheets ortheCanadian Mdnthly Summary) beplotted per month. This isanapproximate technique that assumes themost intense rain rates occur duetoconvective rain systems, andthethresholds ofinterest are athigh rain rates. However, ifmore accuracy isdesired, adetailed analysis ofthehourly precipitation datamaybedone onadaily basis. Thedesigner must determine ifthetime-consuming review ofallthese records isnecessary. Ib6.3.7.2DeterminationofXhj\" Thesystemrainmargin andother parameters will determine thethreshold rain rate Rjabove which thesystem will be inoperative ordegraded.This value isobtained byiteratively solving the equation inFigure 6.3-1. From thehourly precipitation data fortheworst month during Nyears foranearby weather station, thedays with heavy rain rates aredetermined andcopies ofthegauge recordings forthese days are ordered. Thehighest rain rate during themonth mayberesolved to15-minute resolution intheHourly Precipitation Data sheet.
