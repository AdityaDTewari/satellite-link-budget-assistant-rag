(5)(20) A number of airlines in the United State§ plus such foreign carriers as Qantas, Japan Airlines, and BOAC have participated in these tests. Briefly, the aircraft terminals have consisted of a frequency modulation transceiver capable of radiating up to 500 W, data acquisition equipment, and specially designed circularly polarized antenna installations. Ground-satellite-aircraft tests have demonstrated the feasibility of realizing a high operational reliability in such links. Multipath fading, scintillation, and air­ craft antenna anomalies (i. e.-, variations in gain, as function of aspect angle to satel­ lite and polarization elliptidity) have been primary causes of signal fading. High solar and magnetic field activity affected propagation but did not present unmanage­ able problems. Precipitation static dischaiges raised n6rmal!i00 ,K antenna temperatures to 70, 000°K. To achieve acceptable communications during these 13-25 Table 13-17. NASA Baseline VHF Tests Type Test Nature of Results Obtained 1, Receive Signal Level Good correlation with theory. Diurnal trend indicated showing peak signal level reached in evening hours following sunset. Daily variation is as much as 6 dB. 2.. Carrier to Noipe Versus Downlink limited region or maximum C/N Uplink EIRP - reached at a ground transmitted EIRP of about 40 dBW. Maximum measured C/N on ATS-1 was 17 dB and on ATS-3 was 20 dB, 3. Signal to Noise, Carrer Predicted and measured S/N and C/N displayed to Noise & Data Error good agreeme~t. Data error rate at 1. 2 Kbps Rate showed that local RFI was a predominant factor. 4. Satellite Transponder O ATS-1, 2 equal accessing carriers could Passband Frequency differ in transmitted power by as much as 9 dB Response due to gain variations across passband plus compression. On ATS-3, maximum difference was 4 dB. 5. Satellite Transponder On ATS-1, QdB of small carrier compression"}
