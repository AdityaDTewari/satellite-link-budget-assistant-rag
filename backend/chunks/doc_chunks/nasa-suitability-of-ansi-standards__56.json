Itconcludes with asample link budget cale_ _tion using link parameters for thehigh burstrate (HBR) reference station othe NASA Advanced Communications Technology SateJlite (ACTS) system. Link power budgets can beconstructed for any radio frequency (rf) _ transmission system. Like anybudget(financial ortransmission link), the assets (transmit power and anten_la gain) are summed and the liabilities (propagation losses, system losses, andthermal noise) aresubtracted giving a networth (C/No). Thegeneral rflink power budget_quation is(all quantities areindecibels [dB]) C/No =EIRP +G/TsLfs Lm_c+BO-k [1] where C/No isthecarrier-to-noise density ratio indBHz, !
