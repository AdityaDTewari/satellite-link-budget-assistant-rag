Spreading loss . 2.There are many models used in the industry today to estimate the propagation path loss, and the most common are: A.Free Space Path Loss ( FSPL ). B.Hata Path Loss. C.Lee Path Loss. 3.Each propagation path loss model has its own requirements that need to be met in order to be utilized correctly. 4.The Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) is used as the foundation for all propagation path loss models."}
