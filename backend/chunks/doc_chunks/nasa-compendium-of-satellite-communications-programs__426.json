Principal Investigator: Dr. Abroad Ghais, Goddard Space Flight Center. 13-113 13.4.5.10 Tracking and Data Relay -Experiment ATS-6 will be used to conduct track­ ing and data relay experiments with at least two other NASA spacecraft, both planned for launch in 1974. One is the Nimbus-F meteorological research space- , \" craft to be placed into a polar orbit some 1,110 kilometers (690 statute miles) above earth. The other is the GEOS-C geodetic research spacecraft which will be launched TDRE. Satellites in near-earth orbit collect valuable weather and geophysical data However, transfer of.information is difficult since low-orbit spacecraft are out of range of controlling ground stations into a highly inclined orbit (65 degrees much of the time, and determination of the precise orbit parameters also is a problem. The Tracking and Data Relay Experiment will use from the equator) at an altitude of 843 kilo- ATS-F and its steerable 30-foot parabolic antenna to demonstrate the advantages of performing these functions via a synchronous satellite. This will be accomplished by tracking and maintaining S-band com­meters (524 statute miles). munications with the low orbiting NIMBUS weather satellite. The data received from NIMBUS will be relayed to the ground station on C-banb, using the ATS-F spacecraft's earth coverage horn. (39) The information and experience pro­ vided by these experiments will have. scientific as well as practical application. For example, the highly precise tracking information (range and range rate) will contri­ bute to studies of earth's gravitational field. This information will have further appli­ cation to studies of the steady-state shape of earth. All the tracking and data relay information collected will be valuable for the future transition from a totally ground based tracking system"}
