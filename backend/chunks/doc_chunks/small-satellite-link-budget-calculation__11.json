It must be higher than the sensitivity Compute the noise received by the antenna De ne the reference point to compute the performance of the Link Budget. Typically at the entrance of the receiver or at the entrance of the LNA Use the SNR and/or Eb=N0methods to determine if we have achieved the required margins Small Satellite Link Budget Calculation 40/46Critical points in a Satellite Link Received power Noise Signal to noise ratio Conclusions Methods for computation of the Link Budget Methods for computation of the Link Budget Method 1 : SNR Method (More realistic). Usually, the Link budget is computed to provide a SNR greater than minimum SNR at the entrance of the LNA of the receiver. For this method it is necessary to know the bandwidth used by the receiver Method 2 : Eb=N0Method (less realistic). It is assumed that the receiver"}
