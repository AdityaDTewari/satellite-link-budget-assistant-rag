The AN/MSC-46 antennas have been modified by replacing the subreflector assembly with a single Dielguide (dielectric cone) feed. The AN/MSC-46 terminal is equipped with the same FM and PN (pseudo­ noise) modulation and multiplex equipment as described for the AN/FSC-9. The AN/MSC-46 terminals also have the AN/TCC-3 five-channel multi­ plex unit. The baseband configuration of the top four channels is inverted; i.e., the carriers and lower sidebands are suppressed. The baseband configuration of the AN/FCC-55 multiplex is upright; i.e., the carriers and upper sidebands are suppressed. Thus, the AN/TCC-3 baseband is incompatible with the AN/FCC-55 baseband. The prime power requirements of the AN/MSC-46 terminal are outlined as follows: voltage, 3 phase, 120/208 V ± 10 percent, 50 or 60 Hz ± 5 per­ cent, 175 kW. These requirements may be filled for most terminals by either local com­ mercial power or by three 100-kW diesel generators which are a part of the terminal configuration. The radome is a fixed enclosure that offers protection for the antenna against wind, sand, dust, salt spray, rain and ice. It is built to operate with an internal overpressure of 8273.7 newton/meter 2 (1.2 psi) relative to atmospheric pressure. The total weight of the radome is 2540 kilograms (5600 pounds) and its diameter is 18 meters (60 feet). 3. AN/TSC-54 The AN/TSC-54 is a transportable satellite communication earth terminal. It provides the capability for tracking"}
