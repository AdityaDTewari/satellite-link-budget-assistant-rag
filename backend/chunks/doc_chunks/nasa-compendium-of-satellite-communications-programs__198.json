The first property provided The diversity necessary to combat frequency selective fading due to multipath and RFI. The second property- minimized the possibility of decoder error due to channel cross-talk. 9.3.3 Spacecraft Characteristics of the cdmmunications related subsystems of the LES-5 and 6 spacecraft are given in Table 9-15. See References 21, 32, and 39 through 42. A block diagram-of the transponder on LES-5 is shown in Figure 9-6 (39). The LES-6 transponder was basically the same as that shown for LES-5. Transponder fre­ quencies, powers and bandwidths. were different. Additionally, the beacon trans­ mitter served as the third input to the antenna triplexer instead of the telemetry trans­ mitter. The latter employed a separate- antenna for signal radiations. The characteristics of LES-3 are not summarizedAn Table 9-15 since it did not dontain a cominunications repeater. LES-3 was built to provide an orbiting UHF beacon to be used fot propagation measurements. It radiated 28.5 watts biphase modulated by a 15-bit pseudorandom sequence clocked at a rate of 100 kHz (11)(14) Such a signal permitted detailed measurdments of the multipath and fading character­ istics of the propagation medium. LES-3 was constructed utilizing the frame, power system, and power amplifiers designed for LES-1 and 2 and was similar in appearance. to these satellites(1)(19) The most apparent difference was alack of optical sensors and X-band antennas on the triangular faces and the presence, of a UHF. monolole- antenna projecting from the top and bottom rectangular surfaces of the spin stabilized satellite.
