Surveyor Planar Array and Antenna Patterns 4.3.3 Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO)(18) The OSO-I S-band antenna consists of a cavity backed circumferential slotradiator excited by 64 evenly spaced probes fed in phase. The slot radiator is covered with a fiberglass radome. A stripline corporate feed is associated with each quadrant; the outputs of the four corporate feeds connect to a 4-way power divider. The antenna is designed to provide approximately -6 dB gain over a nearly spherical coverage area. The pre- dominant radiation is polarized in the plane of the spacecraft wheel spin axis. Elliptical polarization occurs in the region of the polar axis. A schematic of a portion of the OSO \"bellyband\" antenna is shown in Figure 4. 7. In addition to the probes and S-band cavities shown, two VHF whip antennas are integrated with and protrude from each quadrant of the slot array. The resulting S-band radiation patterns are shown in Figure 4.8. The characteristics and performance of the OSO-I antenna are given in Table 4.5.
