The shipboard program AN/SSC-3 was cancelled. The other three terminals will be described in this section. All terminals were developed to simultaneously transmit and receive opposite senses of circular polarization and to automatically track satellites in circular orbits as low as 9,260,000 meters (5000 nautical miles). Table 12-7 summarizes the character­ istics of these earth terminals. 1. AN/FSC-9 This terminal type was originally developed for the Advent program and was converted to meet the requirements of the DSCS and other experi­ mental programs. Figure 12-6 is a photograph of the AN/FSC-9 and Figure 12-7 is a simplified block diagram of the ground terminal. The antenna is an 18-meter (60-foot) diameter paraboloid reflector with an automatic tracking feed system. The reflector for the antenna includes a superstructure that acts as a counterweight and provides housing for electronic equipment. The estimated weight of the antenna is 172,000 kg (190 tons). The antenna was designed to operate with low altitude satellites and hence, the axes have rotational rates of about 100 per second. Also, the antenna was originally designed to operate at SYNCOM frequencies; thus, its gain when converted to the DSCS frequencies was lower than an 12-12 0 Table 12-5.
