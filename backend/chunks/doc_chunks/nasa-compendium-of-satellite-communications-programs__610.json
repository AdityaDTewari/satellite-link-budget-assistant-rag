A notable feature of certain earth terminal electronics is the single (voice) channel per carrier (SCPC) equipment which results in great operational flexibility for small users. A summary of the antenna characteristics and capabilities is given in Table 20-9 which applies to both the RCA 10-m (32-ft.) and 11-m (35-ft.) antennas. The earth terminal electronics is described for the various terminals in Figure 20-16 which is a block diagram of an 11-m (35-ft.) dual feed antenna terminal, and Figure 2-17 which is for a 10-in (35-ft.) single feed antenna terminal; and Figure 20-18 which shows the relative simplicity of a receive only earth terminal. 20-22 CDt Figure 20-13.
