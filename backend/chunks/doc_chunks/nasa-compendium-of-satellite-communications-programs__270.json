It is anticipated that by 1976 as many as 40 stations will be using SPADE. Following the MATE system success, INTELSAT started planning for the next generation of TDMA systems, with emphasis on extending the state-of-the-art in all 10-51 technological areas relating to TDMA. The resulting experimental system, called MAT-1, is a PCM-PSK-TDMA system for 12 to 24 channel links. It is based upon a 50-Mbps transmission rate that yields over 700 8-bit PCM channels in a 10-station network configuration. A unique feature of this system is its orientation toward de­ mand assignment. The Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) Research Laboratory has developed a 50-Mbps TDMA system, called TTT, which has time-assigned traffic blocks, including a block devoted to an experimental pulse-code modulation, time-assignment speech interpola­ tion (PCM-TASI) design. The MAT-i and the TTT systems are compatible; field tests of these terminals were conducted in July 1970, over INTELSAT III (F-4) among stations in Hawaii, Japan, Australia. Another technique being actively developed is that of placing a time-division switching capability on-board the satellite itself. This technique will become partic­ ularly attractive as satellites providing multiple spot beams come into use. In this technique, known as Satellite-Switched Multiple Access, all stations' transmissions are frame-synchronized by destination as they enter their respective satellite re­ ceivers. Following amplification and, perhaps, down conversion, these signals enter the satellite distribution subsystem that acts as a time-division switch. In this switch, all the traffic intended for a particular destination is sequeitially directed toward. the output amplifier and antenna for that destination. The receiving system demodulates a single carrier, and the frame synchronization is now source oriented rather than destination oriented. Still another area of major concern to the INTELSAT program has been link pro­ pagation. Considerable detailed data on satellite link propagation characteristics at"}
