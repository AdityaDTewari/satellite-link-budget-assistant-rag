The bags, therefore, were not opened to start sublimation and the buildup to higher pressurization until the sun's energy elevated the temperature of the satellite. This occurred long after initial inflation and the danger of rupture due to dynamic loads had passed. Initial pressurization was designed to be higher than for Echo I. The theory be­ hind the use of the three-layer laminated material and this higher pressurization was that the different moduli of elasticity of mylar and aluminum would result in the alumi­ num stretching in a nonelastic fashion while the mylar sheet was still within its elastic limit. ( 1) Thus, after the pressurization escaped, the mylar would tend to return to its original dimensions, placing the aluminum cemented to it under a compressive load. This results in a material that behaves like a prestressed beam and is quite rigid. Echo II also supported two radio telemetry beacons mounted diametrically oppo­ site one another at the sphere's equator. These beacons served as a tracking aid as well as a means of telemetering data on satellite temperature and pressure. The pres­ sure monitoring capability extended from a minimum of 10-mm to a maximum of ( 1 7 ) 0.5 mm of mercury. The temperature measurements extended from 3-12 1530 K (-1200 C) to 4330 K (1600 C). The beacon system included two battery packs, four solar cell panels, and interconnecting cables to give a total weight of approxima­ ,tely 3 kilograms (6 pounds). The carrier frequencies were at 136.020 and 136.170 MHz, and each carrier was amplitude-modulated with three sinusoidal subearriers bearing the telemetry information. The antenna, supplied with each transmitter, was a quarter­ wave monopole made of spring wire."}
