However, optical tracking was the preferrea method of tracking when the satellite, was visible (i. e., at night). Circular polarization was employed to eliminate the need for polarization tracking. The direction of rotation (i.e., left- or right-hand circular) was selected at each transnit and corresponding receive antenna to account for the direction reversal that occurs upon reflection from the spacecraft. 3-13 ----Table 3-7.
