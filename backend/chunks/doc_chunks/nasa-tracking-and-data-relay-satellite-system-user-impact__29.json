In addition, once the matrix describing the scattering surface has been generated, it can be reused at relatively little additional expense in terms of computer utilization to determine the antenna location for an optimal combined radiation pattern. Clearly, studies of this form are bpyond the scope of this study. They have been highlighted in order to point out that valuable further studies in this field may be performed to aid the user spacecraft designer in determining the type and location of an antenna for use with the TDRSS. 4-12 4.2.2 Mounting and Deployment Antenna location is generally a compromise between field-of-view requirements and the availability of space and payload mass for the satellite system. Omnidirectional antennas are often the most difficult to locate as their spherical field of view requirement is most difficult to achieve. Omnidirectional antennas are accordingly mounted on booms and masts to achieve a wide angle field of view. Data return from satellites at low bit rates can be achieved with low EIRP. This provides an opportunity to use broadbeam, low gain antennas which do not require steering or tracking. For example, a slotted dipole cone type antenna will provide 2 dB gain over a hemispherical field of view. This antenna could be mounted on a short mast located away from the earth and nearly complete orbital coverage provided with a two satellite relay system. Care would need to be exercised to avoid interference with solar cell arrays or other movable equipments. Satellite telecommunication subsystem designs for higher data rates, which require higher EIRP for reliable transmission may require a balance between antennas, transmitters and power supply in order to minimize overall equipment mass. Minimum mass configurations generally occur at that design point where the mass required for the antenna with its installa- tion is approximately"}
