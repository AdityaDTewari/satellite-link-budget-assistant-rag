LES-1 and 2 were designed to-operate-with-their-spin-axis-normal-to-the-earth­ sun line. As a result, the spacecraft orientation relative to the earth varied making a broad range of coverage by the satellite antenna pattern necessary. This was solv solved through the 8-element switched array of antenna elements arranged in two rings. The two 4-element rings girded the upper and lower hemispheres of the satellite, respectively. Sensors operating at the wavelengths of visible light served as inputs to the logic system determining spacecraft spin rate and earth direction. The logic controlled antenna switching. A 2-throw switch selected the ring to be activated while a 4-throw switch performed the despinning within an individual ring. The automatic magnetic torquing system employed solar cells on the upper 9-10 SATELLITE Type z Number Z I-Xmit Beamwidth (3 dB) Gain Frequency Band Type Bandwidth (1dB) Number t , *Receiver I-Type front end < Front end gain System Noise Figure Transmitter Type - Gain Power out EIRP Stabilization Type w, Capability LU Power Source. < Primary Supplement m Comm.
