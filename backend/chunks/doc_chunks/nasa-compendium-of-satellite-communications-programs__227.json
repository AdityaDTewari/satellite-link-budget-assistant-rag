The Board will be guided on system operational matters by a Meeting of Signatories, consisting of the telecommunications representatives of all member states. At the start of the 6-year phase-o- er period, the Board will appoint a Secre­ tary General to handle administrative and financial management of the s-ystem. Ad­ ditionally, the Board will negotiate a 6-year contract with COMSAT to provide system 10-1 operational and technical management. At the end,ofthe-6-year period, a Director General will be appointed to assume the executive responsibilities of INTELSAT. He will take over administrative, financial, operational, and-technical management-of thesystem. The Director General will be responsible to the Board of Governors, but the exact makeup of the Director's office has yet to be determined. From the time.it. was established in-1964 tQthe present, INTELSATshas pro-, duced four generations of satellite and ground. systems., :;Development of the initial satellite, nicknamed.EarlyBird. and.later:designatedNT-ELSAT. I, was initiated by- COMSAT in November 1963. Just- a year earlier,-inAugust -1962, theU4 S. Congress had passed the Communications,Satellite Ao.t; which authorized the creation of a pri­ vate corporation (COMSAT) to instigate the development of a global commercial 'com­ munications satellite system.' At the -timeswhen Early Bird's development began, the SYNCOM II satellite had just -completed demonstrating -that. reliable communicatipns could be provided through lightweight synchronous satellites. As a result, the SYNCOM satellite design formed the basis for the Early Bird spacecraft. Early Bird was launched in early 1965, as indicated in Table 10-1, and by April 22, 1965, had successfully achieved synchronization into the desired geostationary orbit with the satellite located over the Atlantic Ocean. After a period of satellite performance testing, system parameter evaluation using the operating ground stations, terrestrial and satellite circuit lineup, and public demonstrations, commercial operation was initiated' on June 28,"}
