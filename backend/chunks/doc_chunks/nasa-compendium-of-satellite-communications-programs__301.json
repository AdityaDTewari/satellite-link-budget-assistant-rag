As of mid-1971, equipment was being added to Orbjita stations to further expand their telecommunications capability to permit the relaying of computer data. In 1967 the USSR inaugurated a space television distribution system, using Molniya-1 satellites to allow people in Siberia, the Far East, and the Far North to see broadcasts from Moscow. As of mid-1971, there were about 50 ground stations in this network; a few of the known receiving site locations are tabulated in Sec­ tion 1i. 4. The Orbita stations have achieved an extremely high level of reliability of not less than 99.7 percent. A notable event during 1969 was the building of an Orbita receiving station in Ulan-Bator, Mongolia, which began operation on February 2, 1970. A station has also been proposed for Havana, Cuba. A second generation of ground terminals, Orbita 2, has begun to be implemented. In addition to the communication functions served'by the Molniya-1 satellites, certain spacecraft in the series have been fitted with television cameras and have successfully transmitted detailed photographs of the earth's cloud cover from altitudes ranging between 30,000 and 40,000 kin. These pictures were especially important in determining meteorological conditions in conjunction with \"Meteor\" class weather satellites that photographed the earth's cloud cover from near circular 625-km orbits. Molniya-1 satellites have also participated in the Soviet manned space program by relaying communications between surface ships in direct contact with Soyuz-6, -7, and -8 and a central control site within the Soviet Union. 11.6.1 System Status As indicated previously, a single Molniya satellite provides approximately 10 hours of coverage on a single orbital pass. Therefore, three Molniya satellites"}
