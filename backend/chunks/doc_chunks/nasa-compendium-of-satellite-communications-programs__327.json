(1) This was a proposed second gener­ ation synchronous communications satellite for continuation of the experimentation started in the highly successful Project Syncom. In 1964, the.program concept was broadened to include experiments pertinent to meteorology, navigation, and general, spacecraft technology. The multidimensioned project thus formed was called the Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) program. By consolidating multiple experi­ ments into a single program,. NASA realized significant cost reductions and structured a program that was directly responsive to the responsibilities assigned NASA under the Space Act of 1958 and the Satellite Act of 1962. The ATS program, as initially conceived and"}
