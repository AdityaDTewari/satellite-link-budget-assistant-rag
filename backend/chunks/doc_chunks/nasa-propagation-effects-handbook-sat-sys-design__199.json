Thedownlink margin canbegained either through anincrease insatellite EIRP orground station G/T. Rather than attempting toagain increase thesatellite EIRP, we shall exercise ouroption for5-meter ground station antennas, which provides 4.4dBmore gain. (Note that ground stations located indrier climates may meet theavailability requirements with 3-meter antennas.) Since agiven ground terminal will presumably beused fortransmitting aswell asreceiving, theantenna size increase also increases theground station EIRP by4.4dB, }roviding more than ample uplink margin without increasing thetransmitter power. 382 IIFortheanalog example, assume thesamegroundstationlocation and path elevation angle. Theoutage time percentage ofinterest inthis case is 0.15% foreach link. Theattenuation exceedance curves given bythe computation ofFigure6.3-1 areshown inFigure 7.3-3.Onthedownlink, the attenuation exceeded for0.15% ofthetime is17.2 dB. From Figure 6.5-3, we seethat upto12dBofdiversitygain maybeobtained atlarge separations. Here, wewill assume that 10dBcanbeachieved, sotheattenuation exceeded iseffectively 7.2dB.Accompanying 7.2dBofattenuation, there is(by Section 6.8.4)askynoiseincrease of220K. Thenoise temperature ofthe ground station (200K inclear air) increases bythis amount, so\"thedownlink C/Nisreduced byatotal of10.4 dB. Recall that thecomposite C/Nwas allowed tobe10dBworse than thenominalvalue for0.3% ofthetime. Thus, provided wecanlimit theuplink degradation toless than 10dBforatleast 0.15% ofthetime, thedownlink isnearlysufficient asis. Weshall increase thesatellitetransmitted power by2dBto-6dBWtoguarantee itsadequacy. Wecannowdeterminehowmany 120channel trunks mayshare the satellite repeater passband. Given that FDMA requires that thepower amplifier be\"backed off\" from saturationforintermodulation noisereduction, andthat solidstatetransmitter .technology islimited toafewwatts, wemay decidethat about 8trunk-paths shouldbeestablished pertransponder channel. Followingestablished practice forlower frequencies, these transponder channels will be35or40MHzwide. Forthe30GHzuplink,Figure7.3-3 showsthat theattenuation value exceeded 0.15% ofthetime is38.2 dB. Recall that under clear air conditions, a2dBWground terminal'transmitter yielded C/N=87..I dBonthe uplink. ForC/N=77.1 dBwith 38.2dBofrain attenuation, thetransmitter power would need tobeincreased to30.2dBW,ormore than 1kW. Considering thelosses intransmitter output components andwaveguide runs, this may require apower tube ofseveralkilowatts, which isnotnowtechnologically feasible at30GHz. Toprovide therequired uplink margin, then, either the satelliteG/Tmust bedrastically increased, orwemust abandon ouroriginal assumption ofnouplinkdiversity. Wechoose thediversity route asthemore feasible. (Uplink diversity presents atechnological problem ofitsown: the 383 10.0000"}
