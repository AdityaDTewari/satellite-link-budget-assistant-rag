A year and a half elapsed before a second attempt was made on May 10, 1963. The dipole dispenser was carried into orbit as a piggyback payload on a large parent satellite, and the parent satellite was placed in an approximately polar orbit of about 3700-km altitude. The inclination and altitude were selected to ensure that the dipole belt lifetime would be limited by solar radiation pressure. A radio command signal was employed to release the dipole dispenser. However, due to a 30-minute ejection delay imposed by the mission of the parent vehicle, the dipole dispenser was heated unevenly by the*sun. This caused -imperfect -dispensing'which resulted-in somewhat less than half-the dipoles being dispensed individually Nevertheless, a sufficient number of dipoles were successfully dispensed into orbit to allow experimental investigation2 5-2 The subsequent West Ford space experiment demonstrated that the orbiting dipole technique can provide reliable radio communication over large distances. More specifically, this program demonstrated that: 1. Large quantities of fine microwave dipoles can be fabricated, compactly packaged, launched into orbit about the earth, and dispensed. 2. Large quantities of fine dipoles can be made to form a-compact belt around the -earth of predictable dimensions and within a predictable time period. 3. The orbital perturbations caused by solar radiation pressure and the earth's gravitational field are essentially as predicted by theories developed at Lincoln Laboratory. The .spreading of a dipole belt similar to that deployed, over 7 months' time, is no more than about 200 km ina radial direction from the earth and about 60 km in a direction normal to the orbit plane. 4. Solar radiation pressure will limit the lifetime of a dipole"}
