This modulation-demodulation system was preceded by a con­ volutional encoder and followed by a sequential decoder. Information rates of approxi­ mately 200 bps, 5 kbps, and 10 kbps were achieved. At the 5-kbps rate, an information bit was fed to the encoder every 200 Ps. The encoder generated three parity check bits based on the 60 preceding information bits. These four bits were employed to select one of 16 channel frequencies every 200 gs. At the receiver the match filter outputs were sampled every 200 gs and ordered accord­ ing to magnitude. The seven samples of largest magnitude were fed to the sequential decoder which recovered the original information bits. Analogous operation occurred at the 10 kbps rate. In this case, one parity check bit was generated for each input information bit and two information and two check bits were used to select 1 of 16 channel frequencies. At the 200 bps rate, 24 successive 200 As pulses carried the same information while the 25th pulse was a synchronization pulse. At the receiver, the matched filter outputs were integrated over 24 successive pulses before ordering the samples and decoding. This signalling system guaranteed accurate transmission at low values of Eb/N o . To convert this into multiple-access, or anti-interference operation, theblock of 16 channel frequencies employed in any 200 us symbol interval was, itself, pseudorandomly hopped over the 20 MHz bandwidth of the terminal and satellite RF systems. Since the frequency hopping occurred only every 200 1s, the signal acquisition and synchronization requirements were modest as compared to a pseudonoise spectrum spreading system. Acquisition was achieved automatically using time and frequency predictions obtained from a station clock and the satellite ephemeris. The desired synchronization was achieved by transmission of a synchronizing pulse (i."}
