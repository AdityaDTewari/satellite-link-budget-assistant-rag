Questions as t6 the extent of the propagation risk involved and how fast to introduce the service are key to the decision on when and how to proceed. In addition there is a question of the pro­ vision of an L-band transponder to provide for maintenance services. These deci­ sions are not expected to be available from the INTELSAT Board of Governors until late 1974; therefore, half of, a generation of spacecraft known as INTELSAT IVA has been developed. INTELSAT IVA will meet the requirements for traffic growth without requiring the extension of technology change demanded by INTELSAT V. INTELSAT IVA is planned for deployment in the Atlantic basin in late 1975. It is an INTELSAT IV with a communications payload that will provide almost twice. the traffic capacity of INTELSAT IV. Whereas INTELSAT IV is a 12 transponder satellite, INTELSAT IVA will use new technology in RF filters, TWTs and antennas to provide 20 transponders. This is done by reserving the allocated 500-MHz frequency allocation at 6 GHz (uplink) and at 4 GHz (downlink). A unique antenna design produces beams which will cover the Atlantic basin earth stations with side lobes sufficiently suppressed to provide a mini­ mum of 27 dB of discrimination between the co-frequency transmissions on the east and west beams. Actually this design would permit the total reuse of the spectrum so that, in principle, IVA could provide 24 transponders of 40 MHz each compared with V's 12. The IVA design actually reserves four transponders for earth coverage 10-9 service so that only 320 MHz is..reu.ed,, providing a total of 20 transponders,. Two of these earth coverage transponders are to bededicated, in Atlantic service, to tele­ vision and"}
