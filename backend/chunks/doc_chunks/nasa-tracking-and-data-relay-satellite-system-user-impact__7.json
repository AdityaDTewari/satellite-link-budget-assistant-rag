To give some idea of the distribution of the users, Figure 2.2 shows a mission model summary derived from Appendix A, in the form of a density profile. Each dot in the figure represents a different user mission. Also shown is a profile of the user orbital inclinations which shows the distribution tends to bunch at around 300 and polar orbit inclinations. The forward link was defined by the contract Statement of Work(2) to operate at UHF and was subsequently changed(3) to S-band (in the 2025 to 2120 MHz range). The range of forward link bit rates to be con- sidered is 100 to 1024 bits per second. Effective system noise temper- ature of the user at S-band is defined as 1500 K. The return link from the user, originally at VHF and subsequently also changed to S-band (in the 2200 to 2300 MHz range) is to provide a range of bit rates of 1 to 10 kilobits per second. The relevant TDRS characteristics include a 25 dBW equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) at the edge of the field of view; a receiver antenna gain of 28 dB over the field of view; and an effective system noise temperature of 540 K. These figures are consistent with the latest Hughes TDRS baseline(1) A summary of these parameters and characteristics which will be used throughout the remainder of this report is'shown in Table 2.1. *Received from the Study Project Office on 18 July 1972.
