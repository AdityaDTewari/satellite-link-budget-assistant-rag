Satellite Transponder O ATS-1, 2 equal accessing carriers could Passband Frequency differ in transmitted power by as much as 9 dB Response due to gain variations across passband plus compression. On ATS-3, maximum difference was 4 dB. 5. Satellite Transponder On ATS-1, QdB of small carrier compression Compression displayed for 10 dB small carrier to large carrier input ratio. No significant compression measured on ATS-3. 6. Carrier Intermodulation ATS-1 closely followed theortical hard limiter performance. Sum of 3rd and 5th harmonics on ATS-1 was 8 dB down. On ATS-3 the sum was 17 dB down. 7. Interference Effects Various leveis and frequency separations for AM and FM interference evaluated As a function of measured voice channel articulation index (AI) of desired signal. Results inconclusive due to difficulties in interpreting mechanized measure­ ments of AL * Improvement over ATS-1 primarily due to lack of compression in near linear transponder. ** Two input carriers employed. * FM employed on desired signal. 13-26 - -disturbances, antenna noise temperatures mdst-be.lirhited to*a-maximum-value of 70000K. Aircraft receiving from the satellite experienced interference wheh operating within line-of-&ight of aircraft or grouhid stationstransmitting co-channel in the coii­ ventional environment.­ Aircraft-satellite-ground links have, generally, displayed a lower reliability than the links in the opposite direction. A major cause has been insufficient radiated power from the aircraft hnd uplink interference caused by conventional VHF communi­ cations systems within the satellite's area of earth coverage. The factors producing variations in link performance are, in general, the same as for the ground-satellite­ aircraft link. it has been, recommended that an operational system employ circularly polarized atellite antennas and linearly polarized aircraft antennas to minimize antenna caused-performance variations. Maritime radio communications via geostationary satellite has been demon­ strated'to be feasible in a number of ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communications tests. (5)Participating"}
