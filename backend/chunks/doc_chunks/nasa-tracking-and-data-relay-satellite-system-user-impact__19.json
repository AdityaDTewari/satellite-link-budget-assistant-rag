Thus rather than describe visi- bility times in terms of a percentage of the user orbital period, they are simply shown in minutes. As can be seen from Figure 3.8 the same kind of behavior is displayed by the visibility curves as was seen in Figure 3.6 (- 900 gimballing, i = 330). Since , > 900, increased communication time is expected, and in fact, both the maximum and minimum curves in Figure 3.8 do represent greater periods of visibility than those of Figure 3.6. Figure 3.9 presents the maximum visibility times for a user in- clination of 990 for Case 3. As before, near polar orbits result in a zero minimum visibility time for all beamwidths. And, as in the case of _900 gimballing, a rapid increase in communication time occurs in the vicinity of 9 = 600, essentially doubling visibility time for the larger beamwidths. 3.4 Conclusions and Recommendations It has been the intent of this section to provide potential users of the TDRSS with sufficient data to allow preliminary determination of the constraints imposed upon the user antenna design as a result of user communication requirements. If a minimum value can be set on communication time, than for a particular orbital geometry, the data presented herein allows the user to determine both the optimum antenna beamwidth and the antenna gimballing scheme. It is recommended that subsequent visibility studies be performed to investigate the impact of: (1) pointing the antenna along the orbit normal direction or along the velocity vector; (2) gimballing the antenna about an axis other than the orbit normal, e.g., the velocity vector, etc.; and (3) allowing two degrees of freedom in antenna gimballing. Furthermore, a small number of spacecraft are not referenced to the"}
