Its charter ­ called for the establishment of a commercial, domestic satellite system to provide telecommunications services throughout the nearly ' 10 million square kilometers (4 million square miles) of Canada extending across six time zones. Telesat is owned jointly by the Canadian government, Canadian telecommunications common carriers, and the public. The Telesat communications satellites were manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company and initial earth terminals were manufactured by Canadian companies. The importance of Telesat can be understood when it is"}
