Attitude control and stationkeeping maneuvers produced changes. area. It functions as a reserve, or back-up, for the other two. Two additional INTELSAT IV launches are planned, one each for the-Pacific and the Indian Ocean, to provide for additional back-up. Because of the need to provide for rapidly increasing traffic as well as better utilization of both hardware and the spectrum, yet another generation of spacecraft will be required in the near future. However, this 'time a number of more extensive changes in technology will be needed. A rigid requirement for INTELSAT is continuity of service; therefore, any uncertainty requires extensive testihg under actual opera­ tional conditions. The changes involve, principally, the introduction of operations into the recently allocated 11/14 GHz portion of the spectrum. Questions as t6 the extent of the propagation risk involved and how fast to introduce the service are key to the decision on when and how to proceed. In addition there is"}
