Prior to running a calculation, each enabled input is checked to be sure it is numeric and in the correct range. To allow the user the option of calculating system noise temperature directly, an interface for calculating the system noise temperature was added as seen in Figure 7. Figure 7. System noise temperature calculator interface 5o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics One can see the various diﬀerent parameters which can be taken into account when calculating system noise temperature. The program allows the user to calculate the system noise temperature three ways: en-tering the system noise temperature directly, entering the receiver noise temperature along with backgroundsand antenna temperatures, or by entering the backgrounds and antenna temperatures above and the lownoise ampliﬁer gain and noise temperature, and the losses after the LNA. The solar system body distance calculator is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Solar system body distance calculator interface This interface allows a user to select either a close, medium, or far approach from a solar body and obtain a range without leaving the program, as the data is preprogrammed in. Finally, the antenna database interface for DSN sites is shown in Figure 9. It allows the user to select the site, the frequency band used, the antenna, the elevation angle, and the cumulative distribution. Figure 9. Antenna database interface The antenna database interface greatly simpliﬁes the process of obtaining data on a particular antenna such as what power, frequency, and gain the antenna is able to transmit/receive. Usually, one must leafthrough a telecommunications design handbook to obtain this information, but the program was designedto automatically integrate all of the antenna data from the Excel database into this interface. 6o f9 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics IV."}
