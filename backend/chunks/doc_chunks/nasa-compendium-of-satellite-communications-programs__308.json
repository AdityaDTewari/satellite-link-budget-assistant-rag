The highly transportable AN/TSC-54 terminals were used for extension of the DCS into contingency areas, for tributary-type links to outlying activities, and as Navy shore stations. Local conditions dictate the type of transmission facility used as an interconnect link. Table 12-3.

Typical link and terminal types are shown in Figure 12-1. The following three types of modulation were used in DSCS Phase I frequency .modulation (FM), pseudonoise (PN), and multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK). All earth terminals used FDM/FM and pseudonoise (PN). The AN/TSC-54 terainals and the AN/MSC-46 terminals were capable of operating with MFSK. PN modulation yields a degree of antijam protection to the system. 12-4 ERMANY KOREA SHEMYA G RDT&E FT. DIX OKINAWA COLORADO HAWAII HAWAII0 BRANDYWINE CP.

DSCS Phase I Satellite Link, Configuration (1967) The control subsystem achieved an orderly allocation of satellites among the terminal pairs. The basic elements of the control subsystem are the SCCF, the Area Communications Control Function (ACCF), and the Earth Station Control Function (ESCF). The SCCF is the focal point of the control subsystem, and is collocated with the DCA Operations Center (DCAOC) in Arlington, Virginia. The primary mission of the SCCF is'to prepare and distribute long term (60 days prepared every 30 days), short"}
